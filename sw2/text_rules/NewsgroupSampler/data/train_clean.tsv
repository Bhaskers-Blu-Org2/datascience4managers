alt.atheism	 The argument goes as follows: Q-oid quotes appear in John, but not in the almost codified way they were in Matthew or Luke. However, they are considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such, and not an entirely different source. 
alt.atheism	 It sounds to me like it's just SCREAMING OUT for parody. Give a copy to your friendly neighbourhood SubGenius preacher; with luck, he'll run it through the mental mincer and hand you back an outrageously offensive and gut-bustingly funny parody you can paste over the originals. 
alt.atheism	 No it didn't. The motto has been on various coins since the Civil War. It was just required to be on *all* currency in the 50's. 
alt.atheism	 It was no criticism of Islam for a change, it was a criticism of the arguments used. Namely, whenever people you identify as Muslims are the victims of the attacks of others, they are used an argument for the bad situation of Muslims. But whenever deeds by Muslim that victimize others are named, they do not count as an argument because what these people did was not done as a true Muslims. No mention is made how Muslims are the cause of a bad situation of another party. 
alt.atheism	 Nope, I've answered each question posed, and most were answered multiple times. 
alt.atheism	 Specifically, which changes are you talking about? Are you arguing that the motto is interpreted as offensive by a larger portion of the population now than 40 years ago? 
alt.atheism	 But, you wouldn't know what red *was*, and you certainly couldn't judge it subjectively. And, objectivity is not applicable, since you are wanting to discuss the merits of red. 
alt.atheism	 That's right, and this is pretty impossible, right? It would be ideal if we could believe for a while, just to try out religion, and only then determine which course of thought suits us best. But again, this is not possible. Not that religion warrants belief, but the belief carries with it some psychological benefits. There are also some psychological burdens, too. 
alt.atheism	 Yes, and everyone thinks as you do. No one thinks that he is going to cause or be involved in a fatal accident, but the likelihood is surprisingly high. Just because you are the man on the firing squad whose gun is shooting blanks does not mean that you are less guilty. 
alt.atheism	 Are we talking about me, or the majority of the people that support it? Anyway, I think that "revenge" or "fairness" is why most people are in favor of the punishment. If a murderer is going to be punished, people that think that he should "get what he deserves." Most people wouldn't think it would be fair for the murderer to live, while his victim died. 
alt.atheism	 Why are only those people in favor of the system to blame. If society accepts such a system, then each member of society is to blame when an innocent person gets executed. Those that are not in favor should work to convince others. 
alt.atheism	 I answer from the position that we would indeed place these people in prison for life. 
alt.atheism	 Computers are an excellent example...of evolution without "a" creator. We did not "create" computers. We did not create the sand that goes into the silicon that goes into the integrated circuits that go into processor board. We took these things and put them together in an interesting way. Just like plants "create" oxygen using light through photosynthesis. It's a much bigger leap to talk about something that created "everything" from nothing. I find it unfathomable to resort to believing in a creator when a much simpler alternative exists: we simply are incapable of understanding our beginnings -- if there even were beginnings at all. And that's ok with me. The present keeps me perfectly busy. 
alt.atheism	 This is a classic example of excessive faith in reason. The fact that we have trouble talking about something doesn't imply that it is impossible; it simply implies that it is hard to talk about. There is a very good chance that God *can* flibble glop ork groink. Charlie Wingate can flibble glop ork groink, and he isn't even God. 
alt.atheism	 Well, I've said that when an innocent person has been executed, this is objectively a murder. However, who is at blame is another question. It seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions-- realizing the risks--is to blame. 
alt.atheism	 It only falls apart if you attempt to apply it. This doesn't mean that an objective system can't exist. It just means that one cannot be implemented. 
alt.atheism	 There is an easy way out.... Post the flyers on the stall doors, but add at the bottom, in nice large capitals, 
alt.atheism	 I found the same add in our local Sunday newspaper. The add was placed in the ..... cartoon section! The perfect place for it ! :-) 
alt.atheism	 And doubtless, when an atheist does an act of charity they temporarily become a Baptist. 
alt.atheism	 I pondered it for all of ten seconds when I realised that since we don't have any reliable statistics for sexual promiscuity, and since the whole issue of "depression" isn't at all well defined for earlier centuries, you are probably talking crap. 
alt.atheism	 Ok, this is the only thing I will comment on from Stan at this time... part of this forum we call rec.scouting is for policy discussions and related topics. This is a policy discussion, and involves related topics. this is not a "fringe" group discussion. obviously, it engenders strong feelings from all sides of the issues at hand. Wether a particular view is anti-societal or not is your opinion, and yours alone, don't try to make it seem otherwise. If you do not wish to engage in this discussion, use a kill file. If you wish to continue in this discussion, please do so, knowing full well the implications that apply. I know for myself that I plan on continuing with the discussion when i have the wish to have input. I for one am tired of people trying to say that this is not a matter significant for this group! It is, and quite so. Especially for those of us who feel the impact more closely. 
alt.atheism	 Not so. If you are thrown into a cage with a tiger and get mauled, do you blame the tiger? 
alt.atheism	 Sorry, I don't follow your reasoning. You are proposing to punish people *before* they commit a crime? What justification do you have for this? 
alt.atheism	 A new alternative to Scouting for those "unacceptable to BSA" for reasons of religious or sexual preference: 
alt.atheism	 I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of the world if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group of the population. It is rather a ridiculous question in some ways, I know, but my newsreader is down so I am not getting any new postings for a bit, so I figure I might as well post something new myself. 
alt.atheism	 There are definitely quite a few horrible deaths as the result of both atheists AND theists. I'm sure Bobby can list quite a few for the atheist side but fails to recognize that the theists are equally proficient at genocide. Perhaps, since I'm a bit weak on history, somone here would like to give a list of wars caused/led by theists? I can think of a few (Hitler claimed to be a Christian for example) but a more complete list would probably be more effective in showing Bobby just how absurd his statement is. 
alt.atheism	 There is also the question of what is meant by "atheist". A familiar example of the importance of the meaning of the word is as follows. 
alt.atheism	 As I was created in the image of Gaea, therefore I must be the pinnacle of creation, She which Creates, She which Births, She which Continues. 
alt.atheism	 Uh oh. This looks a bit too much like Bobby's "Atheism Is False" stuff. Are we really going to have to go through this again? Maybe the universe is cyclical! :) :( 
alt.atheism	 I assume that you are talking about the appeals processes, etc.? Well, it should be noted that people who are imprisoned for life will also tend to appeal (though not quite as much in the "final hours." 
alt.atheism	 My mistake. I will have to get a newer dictionary and read the follow up line. 
alt.atheism	 Well, I'd say that a murderer is one who intentionally committed a murder. For instance, if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to contain blanks, and someone was killed with such a gun, the person who actually performed the action isn't the murderer (but I guess this is actually made clear in the below definition). 
alt.atheism	 A human has greater control over his/her actions, than a predominately instictive tiger. 
alt.atheism	 Probably we would have much the same problems with only a slight shift in emphasis. Weekends might not be so inviolate (more common to work 7 days a week in a business), and instead of American Atheists, we would have similar, religious organizations. A persons religious belief seems more as a crutch and justification for actions than a guide to determine actions. Of course, people would have to come up with more fascinating rationalizations for their actions, but that could be fun to watch... 
alt.atheism	 Which begs the question: if Satan in this case is metaphorical, how can you be certain Allah is not the same way? 
alt.atheism	 How does that saying go: Those who say it can't be done shouldn't interrupt those who are doing it. 
alt.atheism	 It amazes me that you have the audacity to say that human creation was not the result of the natural process of evolution (but rather an "act of God") and then in the same post say that these other processes (volcanos et al.) are natural occurrences. Who gave YOU the right to choose what things are natural processes and what are direct acts of God? How do you know that God doesn't cause each and every natural disaster with a specific purpose in mind? It would certainly go along with the sadistic nature I've seen in the bible. 
alt.atheism	 Awright! Bobby's back, in all of his shit-for-brains glory. Just when I thought he'd turned the corner of progress, his Thorazine prescription runs out. 
alt.atheism	 What do you mean by omnipotent here? Do you mean by "omnipotent" that God should be able to do anything/everything? This creates a self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively useless. 
alt.atheism	 First of all, I'm not your buddy! Second, read what I wrote. I'm not talking about what muslims are ALLOWED to do, merely what *SOME* practice. They consider themselves as muslim as you, so don't retort with the old and tired "they MUST NOT BE TRUE MUSLIMS" bullshit. If I gave you the names what will you do with this information? Is a fatwa going to be leashed out against the perpetrators? Do you honestly think that someone who did it would voluntarily come forward and confess? With the kind of extremism shown by your co-religionaries? Fat chance. 
alt.atheism	 I got just this far. What do you mean by "goal"? I hope you don't mean to imply that evolution has a conscious "goal". 
alt.atheism	 Koff! You mean that as long as I put you to sleep first, I can kill you without being cruel? 
alt.atheism	 It's not the fact that it can't exist that bothers me. It's the fact that you don't seem to be able to define it. 
alt.atheism	 No, do I have to? I'm just commenting that it makes very little sense to consider everything we inherit to be the default. 
alt.atheism	 responds to a lot of grief given to him In article <1993Apr3.095220.24632@leland.Stanford.EDU, galahad@leland.Stanford.EDU (Scott Compton) a.k.a. "The Sagemaster" 
alt.atheism	 The poster casually trashed two thousand years of Jewish history, and Ken replied that there had previously been people like him in Germany. 
alt.atheism	 I find these to be intriguing remarks. Could you give us a bit more explanation here? For example, which religion is anti-semitic, and which aesthetic? 
alt.atheism	 I was replying to a person who attempted to justify the fatwa against Rushdie on the grounds that his work was intentionally insulting. 
alt.atheism	 Then Mr Mozumder is incorrect when he says that when committing bad acts, people temporarily become atheists? 
alt.atheism	 No, Bobby. Stalin killed millions in the name of Socialism. Atheism was a characteristic of the Lenin-Stalin version of Socialism, nothing more. Another characteristic of Lenin-Stalin Socialism was the centralization of food distribution. Would you therefore say that Stalin and Lenin killed millions in the name of rationing bread? Of course not. 
alt.atheism	 It's about time. Why do atheists spend so much time paying attention to the bible, anyway? 
alt.atheism	 Seconded. I cycle to work each day, and if we could just get those damned cars and their cretinous drivers off the road, it would be a lot more fun. 
alt.atheism	 Poor Matthew. A million posters to call "you car drivers" and he chooses me, a non car owner. 
alt.atheism	 Did you check with the Afghans before posting this? They might disagree. 
alt.atheism	 Do you honestly hold to that tripe Charley? For a start there are enough current versions of the Bible to make comparisons to show that what you write above is utter garbage. Witness JW, Mormon, Catholic, Anglican, and Greek Orthodox Bibles. But to really convince you I'd have to take you to a good old library. In our local library we had a 1804 King James which I compared to a brand new, hot of God's tongue Good News Bible. Genesis was almost unrecognisable, many of the discrepencies between the four gospels had been edited from the Good News Bible. In fact the God of Good News was a much more congenial fellow I must say. 
alt.atheism	 I agree, I reckon it's television and the increase in fundamentalism.. You think its the increase in pre-marital sex... others thinks its because psychologists have taken over the criminal justice system and let violent criminals con them into letting them out into the streets... others think it's the increase in designer drugs... others think it's a communist plot. Basically the social interactions of all the changing factors in our society are far too complicated for us to control. We just have to hold on to the panic handles and hope that we are heading for a soft landing. But one things for sure, depression and the destruction of the nuclear family is not due solely to sex out of marriage. 
alt.atheism	 I apologize for posting this. I thought it was only going to talk.origins. I also took my definitions from a 1938 Websters. Nonetheless, the apparent past arguments over these words imply that like 'bimonthly' and 'biweekly' they have no commonly accepted definitions and should be used with care. 
alt.atheism	 Deletions... I did. Now may I suggest, with the greatest possible respect, that you go read some history? 
alt.atheism	 This is not strickly correct. Only by incorrect application of the rules of language, does it seem to work. 
alt.atheism	 Wait a minute. I thought you said that Allah (I presume Allah == God) was unknowable, and yet here you are claiming to know a very concrete fact about him. 
alt.atheism	 So these hypothetical conscious beings can ignore any influences of their circumstances (their genetics, their environment, their experiences) which are not all self-determined? 
alt.atheism	 The Illiad contains more than one word. Ergo: it can not be the Word of God. 
alt.atheism	 Right on, Jon! Who cares who or whose, as long as it works for the individual. But don't try to impose those beliefs on us or our children. I would add the well-funded group tries also to purge science, to deny children access to great wonders and skills. And how about the kids born to creationists? What a burden with which to begin adult life. It must be a cruel awakening for those who finally see the light, provided it is possible to escape from the depths of this type of ignorance. 
alt.atheism	 Here's the (main) problem. The scenario you outline is reasonably consistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does not support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by latest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for about 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at most) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life has been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before there were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease... mostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just fossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows that disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what brought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then how could it exist before humans? 
alt.atheism	 People with advanced science degrees use state of the art equipment and spend millions of dollars to simulate tornadoes. But tornadoes do not require intelligence to exist. Not only that, the equipment needed is not really 'state of the art.' To study the *products*, yes, but not to generate them. 
alt.atheism	 Of course B.M. is not incorrect. He is defending Islam. When defending Islam against infidels you can say anything and no one will dare criticize you. But when an atheist uses the same argument he is using "petty sarcasm". So B.M. can have his "temporary atheists" whenever he needs them and all the "temporary atheists" can later say that they were always good Muslims because they never explicitly rejected Islam. 
alt.atheism	 I am not aware of any "Turkish Caliphate" viewpoint on this. Can you reference? 
alt.atheism	 Bobby, there's a question here that I just HAVE to ask. If all of your posts aren't some sort of extended, elaborate hoax, why are you trying so hard to convince the entire civilised world that you're feeble minded? You have a talent for saying the most absurd things. Here's a little sign for you, print it, cut it out and put it on top of your computer/terminal. 
alt.atheism	 That's very interesting. I wonder, are women's reactions recorded after a frustrating night with a man? Is that considered to be important? 
alt.atheism	 As you have presented it, it is indeed an argument from incredulity. However, from what I have seen, it is not often presented in this manner. It is usually presented more in the form, "And *besides*, I cannot see... ...nor have I ever been offered a convincing explanation." Moreover, it is not unreasonable to ask for an explanation for such phenomena. That theism does not provide a convincing explanation is not an argument in theism's favor. Especially when different theisms offer different explanations, and even different adherents of what is purportedly the same theism give different explanations... 
alt.atheism	 No, Mathew is proposing a public defence mechanism, not treating the electronic device as an impropriety on the wearer. What he is saying is that the next step beyond what you propose is the permanent bugging of potential criminals. This may not, on the surface, sound like a bad thing, but who defines what a potential criminal is? If the government of the day decides that being a member of an opposition party makes you a potential criminal then openly defying the government becomes a lethal practice, this is not conducive to a free society. 
alt.atheism	 Did you miss my post on this topic with the quote from The Indonesian Handbook and Fred Rice's comments about temporary marriages? If so, I will be glad to repost them. Will you accept that it just may be a practice among some Muslims, if I do? Or will you continue to claim that we are all lying and that it is "not practised at all amongst Muslims". 
alt.atheism	 The first premise and the conclusion are not properly translated as identity statements, since the "is" in those statements is the "is" of predication rather than of identity. Instead, they should be translated using a predicate letter. Using "g" to designate God and "j" to designate Jesus, and the predicate letter "E" for the property of being eternal, the first premise is Eg and the conclusion is Ej. The second premise appears to contain an "is" of identity, in which case it can be properly symbolized as j = g. But your remark that "Jesus is a subset of God" suggests that strict identity is not desired here. If, however, the first premise means that all members making up the set God have the property of being eternal, the same conclusion follows. 
alt.atheism	 If all of those are "is"'s of identity, both syllogisms are valid. If, however, B is a predicate, then the second syllogism is invalid. (The first syllogism, as you have pointed out, is valid--whether B is a predicate or designates an individual.) 
alt.atheism	 Well corrupted the first time is good enough. Seeing that the bible was constructed 400 years after Jesus's death, in the text of merchants (ie-owe this and owe that) I wonder how anyone can take the literal word seriously. Obviously it was not intended for such nonsense, otherwise the authors of the bible would not need to plagerize (sp) off of the Asians for most of the contents that can be interperated to make sense. 
alt.atheism	 The only real problem I have with the argument of christianity is that they seem to ignore their origin that being Asiatic in origin. As soon as christians become the good non ego-centric Buddhists they are supposed to be, then I might listen. 
alt.atheism	 I have an addition to the FAQ regarding "why are there no atheist hospitals." 
alt.atheism	 LIST OF KILLINGS IN THE NAME OF RELIGION 1. Iran-Iraq War: 1,000,000 2. Civil War in Sudan: 1,000,000 3, Riots in India-Pakistan in 1947: 1,000,000 4. Massacares in Bangladesh in 1971: 1,000,000 5. Inquistions in America in 1500s: x million (x=??) 6. Crusades: ?? 
alt.atheism	 This thread seems to be arguing the validity of a religious viewpoint according to some utilitarian principle, i.e. atheism/religion is wrong because it causes death. The underlying `moral' is that death is `wrong'. This is a rather arbitrary measure of validity. 
alt.atheism	 For many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an epistemological consideration: what do we accept as a reliable way of knowing? There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence of gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist. Most philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that must be accepted on faith. Faith is belief without a sound logical basis or empirical evidence. It is a reliable way of knowing? 
alt.atheism	 Well, if everything wouldn't be okay, then tell us what it is that wouldn't be okay. That is, if religions were no longer tax-exempt, then what would be wrong with their lobbying or otherwise attempting to influence politics? 
alt.atheism	 No, you don't understand. I said that I don't think people can discuss the subjective merits of religion objectively. This should be obvious. People here have said that everyone would be better off without religion, but this almost certainly isn't true. 
alt.atheism	 Well now, we can't judge death until we are dead right? So, why should we judge religion without having experienced it? People have said that religion is bad by any account, and that it is in no way useful, etc., but I don't totally agree with this. Of course, we cannot really say how the religious folk would act had they not been exposed to religion, but some people at least seemed to be helped in some ways by it. 
alt.atheism	 This isn't true. Many people are forced to use the "automobile system." I certainly don't use it by choice. If there were other ways of getting around, I'd do it. 
alt.atheism	 While religion certainly has some benefits in a combat situation, what are the benefits of cocaine? 
alt.atheism	 But you haven't taken into the account of propoganda. Remember, if you asked Germans before WWII if the Jews shoudl be slaughtered, they would probably answer no, but, after the propoganda machine rolled through, at least some were able to tolerate it. 
alt.atheism	 Unfortunately your phrasing is ambiguous. Re-writing more carefully, we have (at least) two possibilities. The first: 
alt.atheism	 As far as I know, tigers are not sentient. If I were pushed into a pool with some dolphins and they attacked me, I might be inclined to blame the dolphins rather than the person doing the pushing, as (a) dolphins are not usually aggressive and (b) they seem to have well-developed brains and a capacity for abstract thought. 
alt.atheism	 Don't be so sure. Look what happened to Japanese citizens in the US during World War II. If you're prepared to say "Let's round these people up and stick them in a concentration camp without trial", it's only a short step to gassing them without trial. After all, it seems that the Nazis originally only intended to imprison the Jews; the Final Solution was dreamt up partly because they couldn't afford to run the camps because of the devastation caused by Goering's Total War. Those who weren't gassed generally died of malnutrition or disease. 
alt.atheism	 Yes I fully agree with that, but is it "I don't believe gods exist", or "I believe no gods exist"? As MANDTBACKA@FINABO.ABO.FI (Mats Andtbacka) pointed out, it all hinges on what you take the word "believe" to mean. 
alt.atheism	 Tail-recursive functions in Scheme are at least as efficient as iterative loops. Anyone who doesn't program in assembler will have heard of optimizing compilers. 
alt.atheism	 off of hands being a punishment for theft in Saudi Arabia. Assuming this is so (I wouldn't know), and assuming it is done by people fitting your requirement for "muslim" (which I find highly likely), then would you please try to convince Bobby Mozumder that muslims chop people's hands off? 
alt.atheism	 The above is probably not the most representative paragraph, but I thought I'd hop on, anyway... 
alt.atheism	 At the cost of repudiating the FAQ, I think too much is made of the where we're continually attacked on the basis that strong atheists "believe" in the non-existence of god, I think the separation is a valid one. 
alt.atheism	 Another mistake. Sorry, I should have read alt.,messianic more carefully. Benedikt 
alt.atheism	 Well, this particular thread of vituperation slopped its venom over arguments against our belief system, without resorting to accusing others of bigotry. It's somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry happens in this instance to have originated in rec.scouting, since I always understood scouting to teach tolerance and diversity. I understand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who happen to be of a different race, religion, ethnic background, sex, or other inconsequential characteristics. All the evidence I've seen indicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in gods are exactly such inconsequential characteristics. Thus, pending further evidence, I conclude that those who show prejudice against such people are bigots, and organizations that exclude such people are discriminatory. 
alt.atheism	 No it in the way it is usually used. In my view, you are saying here that driving a car requires faith that the car drives. 
alt.atheism	 This (frayed) thread has turned into a patented alt.atheism 5-on-1 ping-pong game, and I don't have any strong disagreement, so I'll try to stick to the one thing I don't quite follow about the argument: 
alt.atheism	 Not necessarily, especially if the rapist is known as such. For instance, if you intentionally stick your finger into a loaded mousetrap and get snapped, whose fault is it? 
alt.atheism	 For the last time, Bobby. Lack of belief in YOUR god does NOT imply atheism. Just because some moslems aren't moral does not mean they don't believe in a god named Allah, although their Allah may not do the things your Allah does. If a moslem says he/she believes that a god exists, he/she is a theist (though maybe not a TRUE follower of islam). 
alt.atheism	 The amount of energy being spent on ONE LOUSY SYLLOGISM says volumes for the true position of reason in this group. 
alt.atheism	 Well, I could use the argument that some here use about "nature" and claim that you cannot have superhuman powers because you are a human; superhuman powers are beyond what a human has, and since you are a human, any powers you have are not beyond those of a human. Hence, you cannot have superhuman powers. Sound good to you? 
alt.atheism	 Well, it's obvious that you *don't* attempt, otherwise you would be aware that they *don't* all "loudly [claim] to be the One True Christian". 
alt.atheism	 Assuming you are presenting it accurately, I don't see how this argument really leads to any firm conclusion. The material in John (I'm not sure exactly what is referred to here, but I'll take for granted the similarity to the Matt./Luke "Q" material) IS different; hence, one could have almost any relationship between the two, right up to John getting it straight from Jesus' mouth. 
alt.atheism	 If you're talking about this intellectual engagement of revelation, well, it's obviously a risk one takes. 
alt.atheism	 Could you expand on your definition of knowing? It seems a bit monolithic here, but I'm not sure that you intend that. Don't we need, for example, to distinguish between "knowing" 2 plus 2 equals 4 (or 2 apples plus 2 apples equals 4 apples), the French "knowing" that Jerry Lewis is an auteur, and what it means to say we "know" what Socrates said? 
alt.atheism	 It can be painless, so it isn't cruel. And, it has occurred frequently since the dawn of time, so it is hardly unusual. 
alt.atheism	 If there is truly no alternative, then you have no basis whatsoever for your claim. The usual line here, which you call "a prejudgment of atheism", and dispute, is that reason is all we have. Here you admit that you have no alternative, no possible basis for the claim that there is anything other than reason or that reason is inapplicable in religious knowledge, except possibly that reason conflicts with "religious knowledge". 
alt.atheism	 My argument is mainly a proposal of what I think is a plausible argument against extra-marital sex -- one which I personally believe has some truth. My main purpose for posting it here is to show that a _plausible_ argument can be made against extra-marital sex. At this stage I am not saying that this particular viewpoint is proven or anything like that, just that it is plausible. To try to convince you all of this particular point of view, I would probably have to do a lot of work researching what has been done in this field, etc., in order to gather further evidence, which I simply do not have time to do now. 
alt.atheism	 Note that I _never_ said that depression and the destruction of the nuclear family is due _solely_ to extra-marital sex. I specifically said that it was "a prime cause" of this, not "the prime cause" or "the only cause" of this -- I recognize that there are probably other factors too, but I think that extra-marital sex and subsequent destabilization of the family is probably a significant factor to the rise in psychological problems, including depression, in the West in the 20th century. 
alt.atheism	 Okay... I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago. Men and women are different ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically. Much recent evidence for this statement is present in the book "Brainsex" by Anne Moir and David Jessel. I recommend you find a copy and read it. Their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic and is well referenced. 
alt.atheism	 Well, from an Islamic viewpoint, homosexuality is not the norm for society. I cannot really say much about the Islamic viewpoint on homosexuality as it is not something I have done much research on. 
alt.atheism	 How about this description: "An object that is, at one time, both a Euclidean square and a Euclidean circle"? I hold that no object satisfying this description could exist. The description is inconsistent, and hence describes an object that could not exist. Now, suppose someone pointed to a bicycle, and said, "That object is, at one time, both a Euclidean square and a Euclidean circle." This does not mean that the bicycle does not exist, it measn that the description was incorrectly applied. 
alt.atheism	 Sorry, I was, but I somehow have misplaced my diskette from the last couple of months or so. However, thanks to the efforts of Bobby, it is being replenished rather quickly! 
alt.atheism	 Sorry, Bill, I had to clear this up. There may be good evolutionary arguments against homosexuality, but these don't qualify. 
alt.atheism	 Yesterday, I got the chance to hear Kurt Vonnegut speak at the University of New Hampshire. Vonnegut succeeded Isaac Asimov as the (honorary?) head of the American Humanist Association. (Vonnegut is an atheist, and so was Asimov) Before Asimov's funeral, Vonnegut stood up and said about Asimov, "He's in heaven now," which ignited uproarious laughter in the room. (from the people he was speaking to around the time of the funeral) 
alt.atheism	 You and Mr. bobby really need to sit down and decide what exactly Islam *is* before posting here. 
alt.atheism	 Could you explain what any of the above pertains to? Is this a position statement on something or typing practice? 
alt.atheism	 I could give much the same testimonial about my experience as a scout back in the 1960s. The issue wasn't gays, but the principles were the same. Thanks for a well put testimonial. Stan Krieger and his kind who think this discussion doesn't belong here and his intolerance is the only acceptable position in scouting should take notice. The BSA has been hijacked by the religious right, but some of the core values have survived in spite of the leadership and some scouts and former scouts haven't given up. Seeing a testimonial like this reminds me that scouting is still worth fighting for. 
alt.atheism	 Isn't that what I said ... What are you taking issue with here, your remarks are merely parenthetical to mine and add nothing useful. 
alt.atheism	 If your science teacher tells you glass is a liquid, try to get a different science teacher B^). Glass is a supercooled fluid, it is not a liquid (except at very high temperatures). The definition of liquid includes "readily takes the form of its container". Let's try to be more accurate here. We don't want people to think we're creationists now do we? 
alt.atheism	 I disagree: every proposition needs a certain amount of evidence and support, before one can believe it. There are a miriad of factors for each individual. As we are all different, we quite obviously require different levels of evidence. 
alt.atheism	 No cookies, Charlie. The claims that Jesus have been seen are discredited as extraordinary claims that don't match their evidence. In this case, it is for one that the gospels cannot even agree if it was Jesus who has been seen. Further, there are zillions of other spook stories, and one would hardly consider others even in a religious context to be some evidence of a resurrection. 
alt.atheism	 accept the charge of apostacy, because I have never in my adult life affirmed any belief, and what one has not affirmed one can not be said to have apostasized from. The Islam I know states clearly that 'there can be no coercion in matters of religion'. The many Muslims I respect would be horrified by the idea that they belong to their faith *purely by virtue of birth*, and that a person who freely chose not to be a Muslim could therefore be put to death." Salman Rushdie, "In Good Faith", 1990 
alt.atheism	 Actually, the story goes that Lucifer refused to bow before MAN as God commanded him to. Lucifer was devoted to God. 
alt.atheism	 I think this is a big leap sex-depression. One example is myself, where no sex-depression :) But, seriously 1) promiscuity is on a decline, depression is not and 2) it might be more reasonable to say depression-promiscuity. I think depression is more likely to come from emotional problems (relationships, family, job, friends) and promiscuity is used as an escape. Since I see marriage as a civil and religious bond rather than an emotional bond, I don't see a problem with sex before (not outside of) marriage so long as you have the same commitment and devotion as what is expected from a married couple. Of course, this is just my opinion. 
alt.atheism	 I see, it is not rational, but it is intellectual. Does madness qualify as intellectual engagement, too? 
alt.atheism	 From what I read, the other fellow told Salameh how to put it together over the phone. The bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated type, so to put a (I assume complicated) sophisticated bomb together from instructions _over the phone_ (!) one must need some brains I would expect. 
alt.atheism	 Are you making a meta-argument here? In any case, you are wrong. Think of those invisible pink unicorns. 
alt.atheism	 But of course YOUR version of YOUR position has been included in the Charley Challenges, so your claim above is a flat-out lie. Further, only last week you claimed that you "might not" answer the Challenges because you were turned off by "included text". So which is it, do you want your context included in my articles or not? Come to think of it, this contradiction has the makings of a new entry in the next Challenges post. 
alt.atheism	 New in this version: challenge #5, plus an addendum summarizing Charley's responses to-date.. 
alt.atheism	 But, the goal need not be a subjective one. For instance, the goal of natural morality is the propogation of a species, perhaps. It wasn't really until the more intelligent animals came along that some revisions to this were necessary. Intelligent animals have different needs than the others, and hence a morality suited to them must be a bit more complicated than "the law of the jungle." I don't think that self-actualization is so subjective as you might think. And, by objectivity, I am assuming that the ideals of any such system could be carried out completely. 
alt.atheism	 I have a request for those who would like to see Charley Wingate respond to the "Charley Challenges" (and judging from my e-mail, there appear to be quite a few of you.) 
alt.atheism	 No, the argument says John has known Q, ie a codified version of the logia, and not the original, assuming that there has been one. It has weaknesses, of course, like that John might have known the original, yet rather referred to Q in his text, or that the logia were given in a codified version in the first place. 
alt.atheism	 I'm not saying this at all - it requires no faith on my part to say the car drives because I've seen it drive - I've done more than at in fact - I've actually driven it. (now what does require some faith is the belief that my senses give an accurate representation of what's out there....) But there is NO evidence - pro or con - for the existence or non-existence of God (see what I have to say below on this). 
alt.atheism	 When you say, "By definition", what exactly is being defined; certainly not omnipotence. You seem to be saying that the "rules of nature" are pre-existant somehow, that they not only define nature but actually cause it. If that's what you mean I'd like to hear your further thoughts on the question. 
alt.atheism	 This is really tedious. Every bad thing that's ever happened is because the malefactors were under the influence of religion - does anyone -really- believe that. I've seen it so often it must be a pretty general opinion in a.a, but I want to believe that atheists are really not THAT dishonest. Please, stick to the facts and, having accomplished that, interpret them correctly. 
alt.atheism	 Could you explain what any of this pertains to? Is this a position statement on something or typing practice? And why are you using my name, do you think this relates to anything I've said and if so, what. 
alt.atheism	 Ideologies also split, giving more to disagree upon, and may also lead to intolerance. So do you also oppose all ideologies? 
alt.atheism	 You misrepresent me, Selim. The hard evidence for my statements about his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book "Orientalism" by Edward Said. Edward Said, by the way, is a Christian, not a Muslim. 
alt.atheism	 I think the problem here is that I pretty much ignored the part about the Jews sightseeing for 2000 years, thinking instead that the important part of what the original poster said was the bit about killing Palestinians. In retrospect, I can see how the sightseeing thing would be offensive to many. I originally saw it just as poetic license, but it's understandable that others might see it differently. I still think that Ken came on a bit strong though. I also think that your advice to Masud Khan:

alt.atheism	 I don't think there is really any question about which god the courts mean. The request for solemnly swearing, so help you god, is always made after a request to pick up the bible in your left hand and hold up your right hand. In the courts of NC, at least, it is always an old and new testament. 
alt.atheism	 This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism, i.e. the belief that you can't deny anything that you can't prove doesn't exist. This is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are conceivable but not observed to exist, does this mean that we would have to believe in all of them? According to the above poster, we must believe in objects or beings that haven't been proved not to exist so why stop at God? (there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan except for trivial differences, say one is missing a finger, one has blond hair,... and they all live on other planets so we can't see them) The reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God. 
alt.atheism	 What are the volumes that it speaks besides the fact that he leaves your choices up to you? 
alt.atheism	 I heard he had asked the FBI to provide him with a word processor. Does anyone know if Koresh has requested that it be WordPerfect5.0? WP5.0 was written (and is owned) by Mormons, so the theological implications of requesting (or refusing) WP5.0 are profound! 
alt.atheism	 No. It wouldn't be sufficient cause to bitch to the system operator if this was just some guy saying that atheists are going to hell. The point was that recently many messages were posted from that address. Each of these messages was posted to a different newsgroup, with the apparent intent of provoking the readers of that particular group. This, along with the fact that these posts were written in all-caps, makes these posts suspect. Whoever is using this account is using it irresponsibly. If it is the intended user, they should consider appropriate action. If it is someone else-- which seems a possibility, then this is also reason to report it. We get many posts in the flavor of the one that started this thread. It is only because I have seen posts on other groups by this user that I am considering action. 
alt.atheism	 Thanks to whoever posted this wonderful parody of people who post without reading the FAQ! I was laughing for a good 5 minutes. Were there any parts of the FAQ that weren't mentioned? I think there might have been one or two... 
alt.atheism	 This definition does not include all atheists (see the FAQ). However, I (for one) do think there is no need to invoke any divine or spiritual explanations. 
alt.atheism	 Find an encyclopedia. Volume H. Now look up Hitler, Adolf. He had many more people than just Germans enamoured with him. 
alt.atheism	 An universe it has created. By the way, can you tell me why it is less tyrannic to let one of one's own creatures do what it likes to others? By your definitions, your god has created Satan with full knowledge what would happen - including every choice of Satan. 
alt.atheism	 I saw this show a while back, and when I heard these kids quote the Bible to justify their racist claims, I looked up that quote about Jesus hating Jews (since Jesus himself was a Jew, my curiousity had been piqued by such a claim). The jist of the passage (and I am sorry but I can't recall which passage it was exactly) was that Jesus was condemning the Pharisees for being corrupt. Of course, the Pharisees were Jewish too, but it wasn't Jews as a whole that Jesus was condemning, just the powers that be. 
alt.atheism	 If the emphasis is on the "in general", then of course you're correct, since you haven't really said anything. If we restrict our observations to practiced religions, there are lots of examples of god mandated genocide. Just ask the Canaanites. The point is that if you believe in a god, and if you believe he has ordered you to eliminate an entire race, you will likely make the attempt. After all, if it was OK in the past, it could surely be OK in the present. 
alt.atheism	 No. The christians were leary of having an atheist spokesman (seems so clandestine, and all that), so they had him removed. Of course, Keith is busy explaining to his fellow captives how he isn't really being persecuted, since (after all) they *are* feeding him, and any resistance on his part would only be viewed as trouble making. 
alt.atheism	 Anyone who dies for a "cause" runs the risk of dying for a lie. As for people being able to tell if he was a liar, well, we've had grifters and charlatans since the beginning of civilization. If David Copperfield had been the Messiah, I bet he could have found plenty of believers. Jesus was hardly the first to claim to be a faith healer, and he wasn't the first to be "witnessed." What sets him apart? 
alt.atheism	 Does anybody have Bobby's post in which he said something like "I don't know why there are more men than women in islamic countries. Maybe it's atheists killing the female children"? It's my personal favorite! 
alt.atheism	 Looking at historical evidence such 'perfect utopian' islamic states didn't survive. I agree, people are people, and even if you might start an Islamic revolution and create this perfect state, it takes some time and the internal corruption will destroy the ground rules -- again. 
alt.atheism	 I'm sure zero-intested economical systems survive on a small-scale, co-ops is not an Islamic invention, and we have co-operatives working all around the world. However such systems don't stand the corruption of a large scale operation. Actually, nothing could handle human greed, IMHO. Not even Allah :-). 
alt.atheism	 Hey! Glad to have some serious and constructive contributors in this newsgroup. I agree 100% on the statement above, you might argue with Bobby for eons, and he still does not get it, so the best thing is to spare your mental resources to discuss more interesting issues. 
alt.atheism	 Yes, worshipping Jesus as the super-saver is indeed hero-worshipping of the grand scale. Worshipping Lenin that will make life pleasant for the working people is, eh, somehow similar, or what. 
alt.atheism	 Seems he didn't understand anything about realities, liar, lunatic or the real thing is a very narrow view of the possibilities of Jesus message. 
alt.atheism	 And that, of course, is the point. You can't simply divide the world into atheists and non-atheists on the basis of god-belief. 
alt.atheism	 False dichotomy. You claimed the killing were *not* religiously motivated, and I'm saying that's wrong. I'm not saying that each and every killing is religiously motivate, as I spelled out in detail. 
alt.atheism	 Don't listen to this guy, he's just a crank. At first, this business about being the "one true god" was tolerated by the rest of us, but now it has gotten completely out of hand. 
alt.atheism	 I love it, I love it, I love it!! Wish I could fit all that into a .sig file! (If someone is keeping a list of Bobby quotes, be sure to include this one!) 
alt.atheism	 who: kmr4@po.CWRU.edu (Keith M. Ryan) what: <kmr4.1426.733987668@po.cwru.edu with: rush@leland.Stanford.EDU what: <1993Apr5.050524.9361@leland.Stanford.EDU 
alt.atheism	 So the only way you can tell a false hadith from a true one is if it contradicts the Quran? What if it relates to something that isn't explicitly spelled out in the Quran? 
alt.atheism	 I'll take a wild guess and say Freedom is objectively valuable. I base this on the assumption that if everyone in the world were deprived utterly of their freedom (so that their every act was contrary to their volition), almost all would want to complain. Therefore I take it that to assert or believe that "Freedom is not very valuable", when almost everyone can see that it is, is every bit as absurd as to assert "it is not raining" on a rainy day. I take this to be a candidate for an objective value, and it it is a necessary condition for objective morality that objective values such as this exist. 
alt.atheism	 I agree fully with the above statement and is *precisely* what I meant by my previous statements about Islam not being anarchist and the law not being _enforcible_ despite the _law_ being applicable. 
alt.atheism	 Yes, this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws. However, I believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all five schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against muslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do not know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and open hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know that historically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone by the death penalty. 
alt.atheism	 I would be happy to discuss the issue of the 12 Imams with you, although my preference would be to move the discussion to another newsgroup. I feel a philosophy or religion group would be more appropriate. The topic is deeply embedded in the world view of Islam and the esoteric teachings of the Prophet (S.A.). Heresy does not enter into it at all except for those who see Islam only as an exoteric religion that is only nominally (if at all) concerned with the metaphysical substance of man's being and nature. 
alt.atheism	 That's like saying that, since mathematics includes no instructions on how to act, it is evil. Atheism is not a moral system, so why should it speak of instructions on how to act? *Atheism is simply lack of belief in God*. 
alt.atheism	 Well, that explains some things; I posted on soc.religion.islam with an attached quote by Bobby to the effect that all atheists are lying evil scum, and asked if it was a commonly-held idea among muslims. I got no response. Asking about the unknown, I guess... 
alt.atheism	 It appears that Walla Walla College will fill the same role in alt.atheist that Allegheny College fills in alt.fan.dan-quayle. 
alt.atheism	 First of all, infinity is a mathematical concept created by humans to explain certain things in a certain way. We don't know if it actually applies to reality, we don't know if anything in the world is infinite. 
alt.atheism	 You're closer than you might imagine. I certainly despised living under the Soviet regime when it purported to organize society according to what they fondly imagined to be the "objective" conclusions of Marxist dialectic. 
alt.atheism	 So why do I read in the papers that the Qumram texts had "different versions" of some OT texts. Did I misunderstand? 
alt.atheism	 And you know why this is? Because you've conveniently _defined_ a theist as someone who can do no wrong, and you've _defined_ people who do wrong as atheists. The above statement is circular (not to mention bigoting), and, as such, has no value. 
alt.atheism	 Stuff deleted What we should be demanding, is for Khomeini and his ilk to publicly come clean and to show their proof that Islamic Law punishes apostacy with death or that it tolerates any similar form of coversion of freedom of conscience. 
alt.atheism	 Nothing is perfect. Nothing is perpetual. i.e. even if it is perfect, it isn't going to stay that way forever. 
alt.atheism	 My own personal and highly subjective opinion is that freedom is a good thing. 
alt.atheism	 I am one of those people who always willl have unlimited stores of unfounded respect for people who have been on newsgroups/mailing lists longer than I have, so you certainly have my sympathy Tom. I have only been semi-regularly posting (it is TOUGHto keep up) since this February, but I have been reading and following the threads since last August: my school's newsreader was down for months and our incompetent computing services never bothered to find a new feed site, so it wasn't accepting outgoing postings. I don't think anyone keeps track of where other posters go: it's that old love 'em and leave 'em Internet for you again... 
alt.atheism	 This is a good point, but I think "average" people do not take up Christianity so much out of fear or escapism, but, quite simply, as a way to improve their social life, or to get more involved with American culture, if they are kids of immigrants for example. Since it is the overwhelming major religion in the Western World (in some form or other), it is simply the choice people take if they are bored and want to do something new with their lives, but not somethong TOO new, or TOO out of the ordinary. Seems a little weak, but as long as it doesn't hurt anybody... 
alt.atheism	 Your posting provoked me into checking my save file for memorable posts. The first I captured was by Ken Arromdee on 19 Feb 1990, on the subject "Re: atheist too?". That was article #473 here; your question was article #53766, which is an average of about 48 articles a day for the last three years. As others have noted, the current posting rate is such that my kill file is depressing large...... Among the posting I saved in the early days were articles from the following notables: 
alt.atheism	 No, gravity is an inherent system. You don't need any excess information other than observations to determine anything. It is possible to objectively determine someone's guilt or innocence within an non-inherent system. I agree that morality is not necessarily inherent (unless you state that everything we do has an evolutionary basis), but this does not mean that it cannot be objective in theory. 
alt.atheism	 Well, chimps must have some system. They live in social groups as we do, so they must have some "laws" dictating undesired behavior. 
alt.atheism	 Madmen are mad. Do we try to explain the output from a broken computer? I think not. 
alt.atheism	 I think that domestication will change behavior to a large degree. Domesticated animals exhibit behaviors not found in the wild. I don't think that they can be viewed as good representatives of the wild animal kingdom, since they have been bred for thousands of years to produce certain behaviors, etc. 
alt.atheism	 Sure nails can be cruel. I'd imagine nails in your eyes would be *very* painful. But, this does not imply that a painless death is cruel, which is what you are supposed to be trying to show. 
alt.atheism	 How do we measure truth, beauty, goodness, love, friendship, trust, honesty, etc.? If things have no basis in objective fact then aren't we limited in what we know to be true? Can't we say that we can examples or instances of reason, but cannot measure reason, or is that semantics? 
alt.atheism	 How do we come up with this setup? Is this subjective, if enough people agreed we could switch the order? Isn't this defining one unknown thing by another? That is, good is that which is better than bad, and bad is that which is worse than good? Circular? 
alt.atheism	 Huh? Please explain. Is there a problem because I based my morality on something that COULD be wrong? Gosh, there's a heck of a lot of stuff that I believe that COULD be wrong, and that comes from sources that COULD be wrong. What do you base your belief on atheism on? Your knowledge and reasoning? COuldn't that be wrong? 
alt.atheism	 Most likely the tragic situation in Bosnia is a combination of ethnical and religious motives, where religion is just one attribute that separates the groups from each other. 
alt.atheism	 I doubt the death penalty was supposed to be a "deterrent" to crime. If so, why doesn't every crime carry a death penalty ? That would be effictive wouldn't it ??? 
alt.atheism	 I have always held that there should be no attempt to change a persons attitude or lifestyle as long as it makes them happy and does not tax anybody else. This seems to be ok for atheists. You don't get an atheist knocking on your door, stopping you in the airport, or handing out literature at a social event. Theists seem to think that thier form of happy should work for others and try to make it so. 
alt.atheism	 One thing I think is interesting about alt.athiesm is the fact that without bible-thumpers and their ilk this would be a much duller newsgroup. It almost needs the deluded masses to write silly things for athiests to tear apart. Oh well, that little tidbit aside here is what I really wanted write about. 
alt.atheism	 Well, I've provided examples to show that the trend was general, and you (or others) have provided some counterexamples, mostly ones surrounding mating practices, etc. I don't think that these few cases are enough to disprove the general trend of natural morality. And, again, the mating practices need to be reexamined... 
alt.atheism	 Welcome. I am the official keeper of the list of nicknames that people Your have been awarded the nickname of "Buckminster." So the next time you post an article, sign with your nickname like so: Dave "Buckminster" Fuller. Thanks again. 
alt.atheism	 Of course, if you're planning to pull a Rushdie then declaring one's leaving the religion is little to be concerned about compared to one's other plans. 
alt.atheism	 I have made this clear elsewhere but will do so again. Khomeini put a price on the head of someone in another country, this makes him a jerk as well as an international outlaw. Khomeini advocates the view that there was a series of twelve Islamic leaders (the Twelve Imams) who are free of error or sin. This makes him a heretic. In the Qur'an Muhammad is chastised for error directly by God; the Qur'an says that Muhammad is the greatest example of proper Islamic behavior; thus no muslim is free from error. 
alt.atheism	 The majority of those who can open their mouths in public perhaps. There seems quite alot of incentive for the British to have control of NI, like using the North Channel and Irish Sea as a waste dump (I was appalled at the dumping I saw in the harbor in Belfast). It is my understanding that quite alot of radioactivity enters the water -- it'd be quite a problem if NI got its independence from Britain and then stopped accepting the waste. Are you suggesting that British industry isn't making profit off the situation as well? 
alt.atheism	 Perhaps not in Christianity, but in Islam the choice of religious leaders is to be made by the people. So much for your superiority argument. 
alt.atheism	 I didn't say it NEVER mentioned Satan, I said it RARELY, if at all. Please excuse me for my lack of perfect memory or omnipotence. 
alt.atheism	 If one is a vegan (a vegetarian taht eats no animal products at at i.e eggs, milk, cheese, etc., after about 3 years of a vegan diet, you need to start taking B12 supplements because b12 is found only in animals.) Acutally our bodies make B12, I think, but our bodies use up our own B12 after 2 or 3 years. Lacto-oveo vegetarians, like myself, still get B12 through milk products and eggs, so we don't need supplements. And If anyone knows more, PLEASE post it. I'm nearly contridicting myself with the mish-mash of knowledge I've gleaned. 
alt.atheism	 Who has to consider it? The being that does the action? I'm still not sure I know what you are trying to say. 
alt.atheism	 What I've been saying is that moral behavior is likely the null behavior. That is, it doesn't take much work to be moral, but it certainly does to be immoral (in some cases). Also, I've said that morality is a remnant of evolution. Our moral system is based on concepts well practiced in the animal kingdom. 
alt.atheism	 Issued by Khomeini it shouldn't be relevant to anyone. But issued by an honest and learned scholar of Islam it would be relevant to any muslim as it would be contrary to Islamic law which all muslims are required to respect. 
alt.atheism	 At the time Ezekiel was written, Israel was in apostacy again and if I'm not mistaken, Tyre was about to make war on Israel. Like I said, the Prince of Tyre was the human ruler of Tyre. He was a wicked man. By calling Satan the King of Tyre, Ezekiel was saying that Satan is the real ruler over Tyre. 
alt.atheism	 I don't feel that I'm preaching. I'm just trying to answer people's questions and talking about my religion, my beliefs. When it comes to what I post, I don't do it with the intent of converting anyone. I don't expect for the atheists in this newsgroup to take what I say with a grain of salt if they so wish. I just state what I beleve, they ask me how I believeit and why and we all go on. If that's preaching, then I'm soory and I'll get off the soapbox. 
alt.atheism	 The "`little' things" above were in reference to Germany, clearly. People said that there were similar things in Germany, but no one could name any. They said that these were things that everyone should know, and that they weren't going to waste their time repeating them. Sounds to me like no one knew, either. I looked in some books, but to no avail. 
alt.atheism	 If you were omniscient, you'd know who exactly did what, and with what purpose in mind. Then, with a particular goal in mind, you sould be able to methodically judge whether or not this action was in accordance with the general goal. 
alt.atheism	 I agree totally with you! Amen! You stated it better and in less world than I did. 
alt.atheism	 I hope you're not going to flame him. Please give him the same coutesy you' ve given me. 
alt.atheism	 My point is that you set up your views as the only way to believe. Saying that all eveil in this world is caused by atheism is ridiculous and counterproductive to dialogue in this newsgroups. I see in your posts a spirit of condemnation of the atheists in this newsgroup bacause they don' t believe exactly as you do. If you're here to try to convert the atheists here, you're failing miserably. Who wants to be in position of constantly defending themselves agaist insulting attacks, like you seem to like to do?! I'm sorry you're so blind that you didn't get the messgae in the quote, everyone else has seemed to. 
alt.atheism	 Any suggestions as to what a better solution might be? I realize the off-hand nature of the numbers I used. And I can't answer as to what an acceptable loss rate is. However, as I said in another post, I despise the idea of supporting criminals for life. It's the economics of the situation that concern me most. The money spent feeding, clothing, housing and taking care of people who have demonstrated that they are unfit to live in society could go to a number of places, all of which I, and probably others, would consider far more worthwhile and which would enrish the lives of all Americans. Give people jobs, give the homeless shelter. Any number of things. 
alt.atheism	 Or he was just convinced by religious fantasies of the time that he was the Messiah, or he was just some rebel leader that an organisation of Jews built into Godhood for the purpose off throwing of the yoke of Roman oppression, or....... 
alt.atheism	 Ah, the verb "to must". I was warned about that one back in Kindergarten. 
alt.atheism	 Gregg, I'm really sorry if having it pointed out that in practice things aren't quite the wonderful utopia you folks seem to claim them to be upsets you, but exactly who is being childish here is open to question. 
alt.atheism	 Then not murdering would have no moral significance, since there would be nothing voluntary about it. 
alt.atheism	 See, we are disagreeing on the definition of moral here. Earlier, you said that it must be a conscious act. By your definition, no instinctive behavior pattern could be an act of morality. You are trying to apply human terms to non-humans. I think that even if someone is not conscious of an alternative, this does not prevent his behavior from being moral. 
alt.atheism	 They spent quite a bit of time on the wording of the Constitution. They picked words whose meanings implied the intent. We have already looked in the dictionary to define the word. Isn't this sufficient? 
alt.atheism	 Good question. I'm sure some biologist could answer better than I, but animals brains are just set up differently. 
alt.atheism	 That's not true. I gave you two examples. One was the rather pevasive anti-semitism in German Christianity well before Hitler arrived. The other was the system of social ranks that were used in Imperail Germany and Austria to distinguish Jews from the rest of the population. 
alt.atheism	 Excerpts from netnews.alt.atheism: 15-Apr-93 Re: thoughts on christians by Dave Fuller@portal.hq.vi I'm sick of religious types being pampered, looked out for, and WORST OF ALL . . . . respected more than atheists. There must be an end in sight. 
alt.atheism	 You know, it just occurred to me today that this whole Christian thing can be blamed solely on Mary. 
alt.atheism	 You have only shown that a vast majority ( if not all ) would agree to this. However, there is nothing against a subjective majority. 
alt.atheism	 I just thought of another one, in the Bible, so it's definately not because of *lack* of religion. The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for other reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joy and peace. The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were killed when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions lying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice, peaceful solution.) 'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to mind... 
alt.atheism	 But now you are contradicting yourself in a pretty massive way, and I don't think you've even noticed. 
alt.atheism	 As much as I considered some of the (so-called) Islam-related dialogue here a total waste of time, I somehow can't restrain myself in this instance, so, Gregg, try this: 
alt.atheism	 Secular laws seem to value criminal life more than the victims life, Islam places the rights of society and every member in it above the rights of the individual, this is what I call true human rights. 
alt.atheism	 These don't seem like "little things" to me. At least, they are orders worse than the motto. Do you think that the motto is a "little thing" that will lead to worse things? 
alt.atheism	 See, there you go again, saying that a moral act is only significant if it is "voluntary." Why do you think this? 
alt.atheism	 That's right. Humans have gone somewhat beyond this though. Perhaps our goal is one of self-actualization. 
alt.atheism	 Of course, the list has to agree with the nickname laws laid down by the GIPU almost 2000 years ago (you know... the 9 of them that were written on the iron tablets that melted once and had to be reinscribed?). Since I am a prophet of the GIPU I decree that you should post the whole list of nicknames for the frequent posters here! 
alt.atheism	 You don't think these are little things because with twenty-twenty hindsight, you know what they led to. 
alt.atheism	 Humans have "gone somewhat beyond" what, exactly? In one thread you're telling us that natural morality is what animals do to survive, and in this thread you are claiming that an omniscient being can "definitely" say what is right and what is wrong. So what does this omniscient being use for a criterion? The long- term survival of the human species, or what? 
alt.atheism	 Sorry. Wrong. This is how banks got started in the first place. Sooner or later your father and his pals will lend money to someone who eventually goes broke, and then they will realise that they havn't been managing risk very well. Then they will ask themselves what it is that they need to quantify risk, and to persuade borrowers not to take on greater loans than they can carry. And since they don't all want the worry of doing the calculations and handling the money, some of them will specialise in that. 
alt.atheism	 Actually, my atheism is based on ignorance. Ignorance of the existence of any god. Don't fall into the "atheists don't believe because of their pride" mistake. 
alt.atheism	 Gosh, Gregg. I'm pretty good a reading between the lines, but you've given me precious little to work with in this refutation. Could you maybe flesh it out just a bit? Or did I miss the full grandeur of it's content by virtue of my blinding atheism? 
alt.atheism	 Or, with no dictionary available, they could gain first hand knowledge by suffering through one of your posts. 
alt.atheism	 If the Anne Frank exhibit makes it to your small little world, take an afternoon to go see it. 
alt.atheism	 No, that's praying on the young. Preying on the young comes later, when the bright eyed little altar boy finds out what the priest really wears under that chasible. 
alt.atheism	 Oh, Your Highness? And exactly why "should" the quotation marks enclose "laws," not "must." 
alt.atheism	 Well, that's the question, isn't it? The goals are probably not all that obvious. We can set up a few goals, like happiness and liberty and the golden rule, etc. But these goals aren't inherent. They have to be defined before an objective system is possible. 
alt.atheism	 This is becoming a tiresome statement. Coming from you it is a definition, not an assertion: 
alt.atheism	 I'd have to say that I have a problem with any organization, religious or not, where the idea that _simple speech_ such as this is the basis for a crime. 
alt.atheism	 I'll also add that it is impossible to actually tell when one _rejects_ god. Therefore, you choose to punish only those who _talk_ about it. 
alt.atheism	 I have never been to Wisconsin, though I have been to neighbor Minnesota. Being a child of the Middle Atlantic (NY, NJ, PA) I found that there were few states in the provences that stood out in this youngster's mind: California, Texas, and Florida to name the most obvious three. However, both Minnesota and Wisconsin stuck out, solely on the basis of their politics. Both have always translated to extremely liberal and progressive states. And my recent trip to Minnestoa last summer served to support that state's reputation. My guess is that Wisconsin is probably the same. At least that was the impression the people of Minnesota left with me about their neighbors. 
alt.atheism	 You should have tried one of the soc.culture groups in the Middle East or South Asia area (they are a little more open than the Islam channel). I think someone defined atheists as polytheists cuz they say we think the world created itself (or something like that) so each particle is a God which created the other Gods. The soc.culture.african is also nice for some contrasting viewpoints on the benevolence of religion. Especially when Sudan is mentioned. 
alt.atheism	 If a person gives a well-balanced reasoned argument, Tammy, then all are happy to discuss it with him. If he makes astounding claims, which are not backed up with any evidence then he must be expected to substantiate them. If the original author had said that everything was his own opinion and not supportable then people would have simply ignored him. He did not. He claimed many things and his logic was seriously flawed. His argument was for christianity in an effort to try to convince atheists like myself to believe him and his message. I for one will not take things as read. If you told me that pink fluffy elephants did the dance of the sugar plum fairy on the dark side of Jupiter then I would demand evidence! 
alt.atheism	 Science is the process of modeling the real world based on commonly agreed interpretations of our observations (perceptions). 
alt.atheism	 7. Massacre of Jews in WWII: 6.3 million 8. Massacre of other 'inferior races' in WWII: 10 million 9. Communist purges: 20-30 million? [Socialism is more or less a religion] 10. Catholics V Protestants : quite a few I'd imagine 11. Recent goings on in Bombay/Iodia (sp?) area: ?? 12. Disease introduced to Brazilian * oher S.Am. tribes: x million 
alt.atheism	 Every time somone writes something and says it is merely describing the norm, it is infact re-inforcing that norm upon those programmed not to think for themselves. The motto is dangerous in itself, it tells the world that every *true* American is god-fearing, and puts down those who do not fear gods. It doesn't need anyone to make it dangerous, it does a good job itself by just existing on your currency. 
alt.atheism	 This is, as far as I know, complete nonsense. The codification of the bible as we have it now came very much later. 
alt.atheism	 I apologize for the long delay in getting a response to this posted. I've been working reduced hours the past couple of weeks because I had a son born (the day after Umar's article was posted, btw). I did respond within a couple of days, but it turns out that a a coincidental news software rearrangement caused postings from this site to silently disappear rather than going out into the world. This is a revision of that original response. 
alt.atheism	 It is good to remember that every translation is to some extent an interpretation, so (as you point out below) one must really go back to the original Arabic. Regarding the verses relevant to nature, I prefer to use Dr. Maurice Bucaille's translations (in his book, "The Bible, the Qur'an and Science") for in general his translations are more literal. 
alt.atheism	 I disagree with these. What society thinks should be irrelevant. What the individual decides is all that is important. 
alt.atheism	 Yeah, do you expect people to read the FAQ, etc. and actually accept hard atheism? No, you need a little leap of faith, Jimmy. Your logic runs out of steam! 
alt.atheism	 Wait a minute, Doug. I know you are better informed than that. The US has never invaded Nicaragua (as far as I know). We liberated Grenada from the Cubanstto protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion of a strategic air strip. Panama we invaded, true (twice this century). Vietnam? We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam. (I guess we "invaded" Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, eh?) Mexico? We have invaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles for anyone to shoot over here at that time. Hawaii? We liberated it from Spain. 
alt.atheism	 Yup. I can hear the _millions_ cheering for DK right now! Josef Stalin eat your heart out! :) 
alt.atheism	 I've been thinking about this every now and then since I cut my ties with Christianity. It is surprising to note that a large majority of people, at least in Finland, seem to be apatheists - even though 90 % of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland, religious people are actually a minority. 
alt.atheism	 It's only one aspect of morality. Societal morality is necessarily very crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what is necessary to keep that society going - and often it's a little over-enthusiastic about doing so. Individual morality is a different thing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble), but is stronger. For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating meat may be perfectly legal. 
alt.atheism	 I pointed out the secession movement in Aceh which has also been brutally dealt with in the past by the Indonesian government. The harshly with all secessionist movements. the evidence, it appears to me that the Indonesian government has dealt very harshly with all secession movements. 
alt.atheism	 Size of armies, duration, numbers of casualties both absolute and as a percentage of those involved, geographical area and numbers of countries too, are all measures of size. In this case I'd say the relevant statistic would be the number of combatants (total troops) compared to total casualties from among the total civilian population in the affected geographical area. 
alt.atheism	 No wonder in the light of that you are a probably a theist who tries to pass as an agnostic. I still remember your post about your daughter singing Chrismas Carols and your feelings of it well. 
alt.atheism	 commit genocide when it has got nothing to do with religion. Or why so many religions say that not living up to the standards of the religion is worse than dieing? Coincidence, I assume. Or ist part of the absolute morality you describe so often? 
alt.atheism	 We only need to ask the question: what did the founding fathers consider cruel and unusual punishment? 
alt.atheism	 And read some other books on the matter in order to broaden your view first. Benedikt 
alt.atheism	 Early authors and legends. The most important sources can be found in the Martyriologia of the Catholic Church. Makes the Grimms look like exact science. Benedikt 
alt.atheism	 The "System" refered to a "moral system". You havn't shown any reason that chimps "must" have a moral system. Except if you would like to redefine everything. 
alt.atheism	 Didn't you hear? His address has changed. He can be reached at the following address: 
alt.atheism	 True. At first, the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos the military was using, not to mention the taped video transmissions from the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets. But later, and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone. It seemed to me that they didn't have the stomach for the reality of war, that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare. It's like they were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was "nice and clean" (smart missiles dropping in on military HQs), but not when pictures of dead, dying, and maimed civilians started cropping up. What naive hypocrites! 
alt.atheism	 Sorry for using a follow-up to respond, but my server dropped about a weeks worth of news when it couldn't keep up. 
alt.atheism	 NO. He hasn't extended to US the courtesy you've shown us, so he don't get no pie. Tammy, I respect your beliefs because you don't try to stamp them into my being. I have scorn for posters whose sole purpose appears to be to evangelize. 
alt.atheism	 The traditions of the church hold that all the "apostles" (meaning the 11 surviving disciples, Matthias, Barnabas and Paul) were martyred, except for John. "Tradition" should be understood to read "early church writings other than the bible and heteroorthodox scriptures". 
alt.atheism	 Sounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy. Just what organization did he belong to? Does it have a name? 
alt.atheism	 TRH I hope you're not going to flame him. Please give him the same coutesy you' TRH ve given me. 
alt.atheism	 RB RB No, that's praying on the young. Preying on the young comes RB later, when the bright eyed little altar boy finds out what the RB priest really wears under that chasible. 
alt.atheism	 Yes, but whose freedom? The world in general doesn't seem to value the freedom of Tibetans, for example. 
alt.atheism	 The latest news seems to be that Koresh will give himself up once he's finished writing a sequel to the Bible. 
alt.atheism	 Hmm, USENET got it's collective hooks into me around 1987 or so right after I I've probably not posted more than 50 messages in the time since then though. I'll never understand how people can find the time to write so much. I can barely keep up as it is. 
alt.atheism	 I am fairly sure that she could obtain citizenship by making an application for it. It might require immigration to Germany, but I am almost certain that once applied for citizenship is inevitable in this case.

alt.atheism	 m The latest news seems to be that Koresh will give himself up once he's m finished writing a sequel to the Bible. 
alt.atheism	 Since when does atheism mean trashing other religions?There must be a God of inbreeding to which you are his only son. 
alt.atheism	 This is whole basis of a great many here rejecting the Christian account of things. In the words of St. Madalyn Murrey-O'Hair, "Face it folks, it's just silly ...". Why is it okay to disbelieve because of your incredulity if you admit that it's a fallacy? 
alt.atheism	 There is a similar statement attributed to Anselm, "I believe so that I may understand". In both cases reason is somewhat less exalted than anyone posting here could accept, which means that neither statement can be properly analysed in this venue. 
alt.atheism	 Does this statement further the atheist cause in some way, surely it's not intended as wit ... 
alt.atheism	 If this is a hypothetical proposition, you should say so, if it's fact, you should cite your sources. If all this is the amateur sociologist sub-branch of a.a however, it would suffice to alert the unwary that you are just screwing around ... 
alt.atheism	 I'm not sure my new nom d'net is exactly appropriate, but it comes very close. Considering what I have to wade through before I make one of my insightful, dead-on-the-money repsonses, I have to agree that something's getting stirred up. I would like to believe my characterization of what I respond to would be kinder though, but if you insist ... 
alt.atheism	 I'm sure you're right, but I have no idea to what you refer. Would you mind explaining how I copped out? 
alt.atheism	 This is fascinating. Atheists argue for abortion, defend homosexuality as a means of population control, insist that the only values are biological and condemn war and capital punishment. According to Benedikt, if something is contardictory, it cannot exist, which in this case means atheists I suppose. I would like to understand how an atheist can object to war (an excellent means of controlling population growth), or to capital punishment, I'm sorry but the logic escapes me. And why just capital punishment, what is being questioned here, the propriety of killing or of punishment? What is the basis of the ecomplaint? 
alt.atheism	 Occam's Razor is not a law of nature, it is way of analyzing an argument, even so, it interesting how often it's cited here and to what end. It seems odd that religion is simultaneously condemned as being primitive, simple-minded and unscientific, anti-intellectual and childish, and yet again condemned as being too complex (Occam's razor), the scientific explanation of things being much more straightforeward and, apparently, simpler. Which is it to be - which is the "non-essential", and how do you know? Considering that even scientists don't fully comprehend science due to its complexity and diversity. Maybe William of Occam has performed a lobotomy, kept the frontal lobe and thrown everything else away ... 
alt.atheism	 I know of a similar incident about 3 years ago. A climatologist( Ithink that was his profession) named Iben Browning predicted that an earthquake would hit the New Madrid fault on Dec.3. Some schools in Missouri that were on the fault line actually cancelled school for the day. Many people evacuated New Madrid and other towns in teh are. I wouldn't be suprised if there were more journalists in the area than residents. Of course, teh earthquake never occured. HOw do I know about his? I used to live in Southern Illinois and the lican middle school was built directly on the fault line. No we still had school... We laughed at the poor idiots who believed the prediction. :):):):) 
alt.atheism	 I don't think the Book of Mormon was supposedly translated from Biblical Hebrew. I've read that "prophet Joseph Smith" traslated the gold tablets from some sort of Egyptian-ish language. Former Mormons, PLEASE post. 
alt.atheism	 Good statement! Should we apply empirical measurements to define exact social morals? Should morals be based on social rules? On ancient religious doctrines? It seems there will *NEVER* be a common and single denominator for defining morals, and as such defining absolute and objective morals is doomed to fail as long as humans have this incredible talent of creative thinking. 
alt.atheism	 I don't think such tools exist either. In addition, there's no such thing as objective information. All together, it looks like religion and any doctrines could be freely misused to whatever purpose. 
alt.atheism	 I agree, I had a hard feeling not believing my grand-grand mother who told me of elves dancing outside barns in the early mornings. I preferred not to accept it, even if her statement provided the truth itself. Life is hard. 
alt.atheism	 Fred Rice answered this already in an early posting: "The problem with your argument is that you do not _know_ who is a _real_ believer and who may be "faking it". This is something known only by the person him/herself (and God). Your assumption that anyone who _claims_ to be a "believer" _is_ a "believer" is not necessarily true." 
alt.atheism	 So that still leaves the door totally open for Khomeini, Hussein et rest. They could still be considered true Muslims, and you can't judge them, because this is something between God and the person. 
alt.atheism	 One book I have which presents a fairly unbiased account of many religions is called _Man's Religions_ by John B. Noss. It was a textbook in a class I had on comparative religion or some such thing. It has some decent bibliographies on each chapter as a jumping off point for further reading. 
alt.atheism	 True, all you need to define is one statement that defined one polarity, and all the other states are considered the other polarity. Then again what is the meaning of nil, false or true :-) ? 
alt.atheism	 Lucky for them that the baby didn't have any obvious deformities! I could just see it now: Mary gets pregnant out of wedlock so to save face she and Joseph say that it was God that got her pregnant and then the baby turns out to be deformed, or even worse, stillborn! They'd have a lot of explaining to do.... :-) 
alt.atheism	 It's not really their _decision_ to be tried. The rulings _do_ have legal consequences, but only in Islamic law and not in UK law (this should be obvious). Enforcing a judgment is distinct from the making of a judgment. Take for example the judgments of the World Court. This is an internationally recognized tribunal whose judgments often have no physical or economic effect but which _are_ important despite the fact that their judgments cannot be enforced 
alt.atheism	 When the Quran uses the word *din* it means way of individual thinking, behaving, communal order and protocols based on a set of beliefs. This is often interpreted as the much weaker term religion. 
alt.atheism	 The recent rise of nostalgia in this group, combined with the incredible level of utter bullshit, has prompted me to comb through my archives and pull out some of "The Best of Alt.Atheism" for your reading pleasure. I'll post a couple of these a day unless group concensus demands that I stop, or I run out of good material. 
alt.atheism	 I assume you are posting to encourage comments - how much history has Tony Campello read? Not much it seems. 
alt.atheism	 a) I think that he has a rather witty .sig file. It sums up a great deal of atheistic thought (IMO) in one simple sentence. b) Atheism isn't an "other religion". 
alt.atheism	 I would like a list of Bible contadictions from those of you who dispite being free from Christianity are well versed in the Bible. 
alt.atheism	 If I'm wrong, god is free at any time to correct my mistake. That he continues not to do so, while supposedly proclaiming his undying love for my eternal soul, speaks volumes. 
alt.atheism	 What if any, historical reference do we have to abortion at this time? Did the ancient Jew have appropriate reference to understand abortion? (I am truly asking, not making a point veiled as a question). If there is little understanding of the medical procedure we know as abortion, it is not surprising the Bible makes little reference to it, as it makes little reference to nuclear power and contamination. 
alt.atheism	 YOU BLASHEPHEMERS!!! YOU WILL ALL GO TO HELL FOR NOT BELIEVING IN GOD!!!! BE PREPARED FOR YOUR ETERNAL DAMNATION!!! 
alt.atheism	 Wow, you're quicker to point out heresy than the Church in the Middle ages. Seriously though, even the Sheiks at Al-Azhar don't claim that the Shi'ites are heretics. Most of the accusations and fabrications about Shi'ites come out of Saudi Arabia from the Wahabis. For that matter you should read the original works of the Sunni Imams (Imams of the four madhabs). The teacher of at least two of them was Imam Jafar Sadiq (the sixth Imam of the Shi'ites). 
alt.atheism	 I lived in Tokyo for a year and a half, and one of the many reasons why I intend to go back indefinitely is the freedom one enjoys when one can walk anywhere (and I mean *anywhere*) at any time of day or night and not feel uneasy, even if one's from an ethnic minority as I was. 
alt.atheism	 excuse me for my ignorance. But I remember reading once that the Biblical tribe known as the Philistines still exists...they are the modern day Palestinians. Anyone out there with more info, please post it!!! 
alt.atheism	 To all a.a readers: I have been asked be several of you to post a list of the SDA Church's 27 Fundamental beliefs. I warn you now, it's a long list. However, I'll post it on Sunday. Sabbath is coming up soon so I won't be reading on Saturday. And I don't have time to do it now. I would GREATLY appreciate it if you would keep me in touch with what's going on. I hope all of you have a reastful and relaxing weekend. I hope it's the best one so far!! 
alt.atheism	 Gregg, so would you consider that Rushdie would now be left alone, and he could have a normal life? In other words, does Islam support the notion of forgiving? 
alt.atheism	 This is an interesting notion -- and one I'm scared of. In my case I'm a Finnish citizen, I live in USA, and I have to conform to the US laws. However, the Finnish government is not actively checking out what I'm doing in this country, in other words checking out if I conform to the Finnish laws. 
alt.atheism	 Hehehe, so you say, but this objective morality somehere tells you that this is not the case, and you don't know all the rules of such transcendental game systems... 
alt.atheism	 Tammy, is this all explicitly stated in the bible, or do you assume that you know that Ezekiel indirectly mentioned? It could have been another metaphor, for instance Ezekiel was mad at his landlord, so he talked about him when he wrote about the prince of Tyre. 
alt.atheism	 I tend to agree. I came here when it first started and watched it grow from the roots on talk.religion.misc. It seemed to take a while for enough atheists to come forward to get past the "Let's trash Xians" and such. Now there's a stable core, and frankly there's a feeling that this is _our_ group. 
alt.atheism	 If this is grounded firmly in Islam, as you claim, then you have just exposed Islam as the grounds for terrorism, plain and simple. 
alt.atheism	 If the first rule of humor is never having to say you're sorry then the second rule must be never having to explain yourself. Few things are worse that a joke explained. In spite of this, and because of requests for me to post my list o' nicknames, I must admit that no such list exists. It was simply a plot device, along with me being the keeper o' the list, to make the obvious play on the last name of Fuller and to advance the idea that such a list should be made. 
alt.atheism	 The number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and exploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media. The facts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians in any other war of comparable size this century! This was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only recently. 
alt.atheism	 Nope, Germany has extremely restrictive citizenship laws. The ethnic Germans who have lived in Russia for over 100 years automatically become citizens if they move to Germany, but the Turks who are now in their third generation in Germany can't. It's not a very good example to show citizenship without descent. 
alt.atheism	 J YOU BLASHEPHEMERS!!! YOU WILL ALL GO TO HELL FOR NOT BELIEVING IN GOD!!!! BE J PREPARED FOR YOUR ETERNAL DAMNATION!!! 
alt.atheism	 No, I say religious law applies to those who are categorized as belonging to the religion when event being judged applies. This prevents situations in which someone is a member of a religion who, when charged, claims that he/she was _not_ a member of the religion so they are free to go on as if nothing had happened. 
alt.atheism	 Sure. Yes, I did. You see I don't think that rape and murder should be dealt with lightly. You, being so interested in leniency for leniency's sake, apparently think that people should simply be told the "did a _bad_ thing." 
alt.atheism	 It is all written in _The_Wholly_Babble:_the_Users_Guide_to_Invisible_ _Pink_Unicorns_. 
alt.atheism	 I think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how deviant the view _as I've articulated it above_ (which may not be the true view of Khomeini) is from the basic principles of Islam. So that the non-muslim readers of this group will see how far from the simple basics of Islam such views are on the face of them. And if they are _not_ in contradiction with the basics of Islam, how subtle such issues are and how it seems sects exist in Islam while they are explicitly proscribed by the Qur'an. 
alt.atheism	 Writing the Seven Seals or something along those lines. He's already written the first of the Seven which was around 30 pages or so and has handed it over to an assistant for PROOFREADING!. I would expect any decent messiah to have a built-in spellchecker. Maybe Koresh 2.0 will come with one. 
alt.atheism	 Well, it looks like the folks in soc.religion.islam have loosened up a bit and are discussing this topic as well as the banking/interest topic. A few books on the subject have also been mentioned in addition to the one you mentioned. These may be hard to find, but I think I may take a stab at it out of curiosity. I know the one film I saw on this subject was pretty weak and the only two quotes I have seen which were used to show science in the Koran (which I posted here) were also pretty vague. I suspect that these books will extrapolate an awful lot on the quotes they have. 
alt.atheism	 Which objective system are you talking about? What is its goal? Again, which brand of morality are you talking about? 
alt.atheism	 Basically, any prophet I've ever dealt with has either been busy hawking stolen merchandise or selling swampland house lots in Florida. Then you hear all the stories of sexual abuse by prophets and how the families of victims were paid to keep quiet about it.

comp.graphics	 Hello, I am looking to add voice input capability to a user interface I am developing on an HP730 (UNIX) workstation. I would greatly appreciate information anyone would care to offer about voice input systems that are easily accessible from the UNIX environment. 
comp.graphics	 I recently got a file describing a library of rendering routines called SIPP (SImple Polygon Processor). Could anyone tell me where I can FTP the source code and which is the newest version around? Also, I've never used Renderman so I was wondering if Renderman is like SIPP? ie. a library of rendering routines which one uses to make a program that creates the image... 
comp.graphics	 While I don't mean to damn Henrik's attempt to be helpful here, he's using a common misconception that should be corrected. 
comp.graphics	 I am a Mac-user when it comes to graphics (that's what I own software and hardware for) and I've recently come across a large number of TTTDDD format modeling databases. Is there any software, mac or unix, for translating those to something I could use, like DXF? Please reply via email. 
comp.graphics	 A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos from a 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method. Displaying all 256 levels synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no visible contrast bands. 
comp.graphics	 Why didn't you create 8 grey-level images, and display them for 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128... time slices? 
comp.graphics	 Of course, I do not agree. It does have more horsepower. Horsepower is not the only measurement for 'better'. It does not have full motion, full screen video yet. Does it have CD-ROM XA? 
comp.graphics	 I am currently looking for a 3D graphics library that runs on MS Windows 3.1. Are there any such libraries out there other than Visuallib? (It must run on VGA and should not require any other add-on graphics cards). 
comp.graphics	 A 3DO marketing rep. recently offered a Phillips marketing rep. a $100 bet that 3DO would have boxes on the market on schedule. The Phillips rep. declined the bet, probably because he knew that 3DO players are already in pre-production manufacturing runs, 6 months before the commercial release date. 
comp.graphics	 Does anybody know if there are any good 2d-graphics packages available for IBM RS/6000 & AIX ? I'm looking for something like DEC's GKS or Hewlett-Packards Starbase, both of which have reasonably good support for different output devices like plotters, terminals, X etc. 
comp.graphics	 I don't like xpr. It gives (at least, the X11R4 version does) louzy output: the hardcopy looks very grainy to me. Instead, I use pnmtops. This takes full advantage PostScript, and lets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a (graylevel) image to black and white dots. 
comp.graphics	 By '8 grey level images' you mean 8 items of 1bit images? It does work(!), but it doesn't work if you have more than 1bit in your screen and if the screen intensity is non-linear. 
comp.graphics	 I can't find CTDS (Connect The Dots Smoother) in France. If it is a commercial program I'll happily pay whatever it may cost (do not take it litterally). Please help! I have *LOTS* of PoV sources, texture images and animations though, if you are looking for something, just tell. 
comp.graphics	 Actually I am trying to write something like this but I encounter some problems, amongst them: 
comp.graphics	 For a commerical package try WAVE from Precision Visuals 505-530-6563 
comp.graphics	 I require BGI drivers for Super VGA Displays and Super XVGA Displays. Does anyone know where I could obtain the relevant drivers ? (FTP sites ??) 
comp.graphics	 I sure did use version 3.2. It works fine with most software but NOT with Animator Pro and that one is quite important to me. Pretty useless program without that thing working IMHO. So I hope the author can fix that. 
comp.graphics	 Bear with me i'm new at this game, but could anyone explain exactly what DMORF does, does it simply fade one bitmap into another or does it re shape one bitma p into another. Please excuse my ignorance, i' not even sure if i've posted thi s message correctly. 
comp.graphics	 Please bear with me as i am new at this game, i apologize unreservedly if i hav e posted another message earlier by mistake. but i digress, could anyone out th ere please explain exactly what DMORF does (dtax.exe). Does it simply fade one bitmap into another or does it reshape one bitmap into another. Excuse my ignor ance..... 
comp.graphics	 They need a hit software product to encourage software sales of the product, i.e. the Pong, Pacman, VisiCalc, dBase, or Pagemaker of multi-media. There are some multi-media and digital television products out there already, albeit, not as capable as 3DO's. But are there compelling reasons to buy such yet? Perhaps someone in this news group will write that hit software :-) 
comp.graphics	 Hi! I am in immediate need for details of various graphics compression techniques. So if you know where I could obtain descriptions of algo- rithms or public-domain source codes for such formats as JPEG, GIF, and fractals, I would be immensely grateful if you could share the info with me. This is for a project I am contemplating of doing. 
comp.graphics	 Some rendering programs require that all surface normals point in the same direction. (ie: On a closed cube, all normals point outwards). You can use the points on the faces to determine the direction of the normal, by making sure that all points are either in clockwise or counter-clockwise order. 
comp.graphics	 WGT is the WordUp Graphics Toolkit, designed by yours truly and my co-programmer (and brother) Chris Egerter. It is a Turbo/Borland C++ graphics library for programming in 320*200*256 VGA. We are currently producing it as shareware, but in a few years it may be a commercial product (excuse typos, there's no backspace on this terminal). Features include:

comp.graphics	 i am sorry, but this genoa card does nothing that the ATI ultra plus 2mb can't do, PLUS the ATI costs 330$US street price .... 
comp.graphics	 Look for edge inconsistencies. Consider two vertices, p and q, which are connected by at least one edge. 
comp.graphics	 Yeah, of course... The term 'mach banding' was not the correct one, it should've been 'color quantization effect'. Although a bad color quantization effect could result in some visible mach-bands on a picture that was smooth before it was quantizised. 
comp.graphics	 Anybody know of an IGES Viewer for DOS/Windows? I need to be able to display ComputerVision IGES files on a PC running Windows 3.1. Thanks in advance. 
comp.graphics	 HELP MY FRIEND AND I HAVE A CLASS PROJECT IN WHICH WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE A COMPUTER ANIMATED MOVIE OF SORTS WITH THE DISNEY ANIMATION AND WOULD LIKE TO PUT WHAT WE HAVE ON A VCR IS THIS POSSIBLE? IS IT EASY AND RELATIVELY CHEAP? IF SO HOW? WE BOTH HAVE 386 IBM COMPATIBLES BUT ARE RELATIVELY CLUELESS WITH COMPUTERS IF YOU COULD HELP PLEASE DO. 
comp.graphics	 I am interested in any information on stereoscopic imaging on a sun workstation. For the most part, I need to know if there is any hardware available to interface the system and whether the refresh rates are sufficient to produce quality image representations. Any information about the subject would be greatly appreciated. 
comp.graphics	 Yeah, and it's also true most long complicated sequences of events, calculations, or big computer programs in general. I don't argue that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I just question whether you should<. 
comp.graphics	 Are complex bio-medical images available anywhere on the net for experimentation? By complex I mean that every sampled data point has a magnitude and phase information both. 
comp.graphics	 Does anyone know where I can FTP MPEG for DOS from? Thanks for any help in advance. Email is preferred but posting is fine. 
comp.graphics	 I need a complete list of all the polygons that there are, in order. 
comp.graphics	 You'll probably have to set the palette up before you try drawing in the new colours. 
comp.graphics	 I've just had the good fortune to be hired by Electronic Arts as Senior Computer Graphics Artist at the Vancouver, Canada office. :^) 
comp.graphics	 Okay, I've received a whole lot of requests for the movie, so for simplicity's sake I can't mail out any more than I've already received (as of 16:30 EDT, Tuesday). Maybe it'll pop up on a site sooner or later. 
comp.graphics	 Hello, I realize that this might be a FAQ but I have to ask since I don't get a change to read this newsgroup very often. Anyways for my senior project I need to convert an AutoCad file to a TIFF file. Please I don't need anyone telling me that the AutoCAD file is a vector file and the TIFF is a bit map since I have heard that about 100 times already I would just like to know if anyone knows how to do this or at least point me to the right direction. 
comp.graphics	 I usually use "Algorithms for graphics and image processing" by Theodosios Pavlidis, but other people here got them same idea and now 3 of 4 copies in the libraries have been stolen! 
comp.graphics	 I'm sure it is, and I am not amused. Every time I read that part of the TIFF spec, it infuriates me- and I'm none too happy about the complexity of the spec anyway- because I think their "arbitrary but carefully chosen number" is neither. Additionally, I find their choice of 4 bytes to begin a file with meaningless of themselves- why not just use the letters "TIFF"? 
comp.graphics	 It is used to create a TIN (triangulated irregular network), which is basically a bunch of triangles which form a surface over a group of points. What is special about it is that the triangles formed are the most equalateral possible. Check out "Proceedings of AutoCarto N" where N is 8..10. Sorry, I don't have a specific reference describing the process. -Michael 
comp.graphics	 I am writing some utilies to convert Regis and Tektonic esacpe sequences into some useful formats. I would rather not have to goto a bitmap format. I can convert them to Window Meta FIles easily enough, but I would rather convert them to Corel Draw, .CDR, or MS Power Point, .PPT, files. Microsoft would not give me the format. I was wondering if anybody out there knows the formats for these two applications. 
comp.graphics	 Yep... Alchemy works fine on my Tseng400+DAC, but I think I remember reading that it only displays in 15-bit or so. Of course, that's still 32K colors which is nothing to sneeze at. Use the --v flag. 
comp.graphics	 There is a new product for the (IBM'ers) out there... it is called IMAGINE and it just started shipping yesterday... I can personally attest that it will blow the doors off of 3D-Studio. It is made by IMPUlSE, and is in its 3rd version....(1st) for the IBM.... it can do morphing, your standard key-framming animation, it is a raytracer (reflections & shadows), and can do/apply special FX to objects... (like ripple, explode, bounce) things of that nature. Also it has algorithmic texture maps....and your standard brushmapping also... 
comp.graphics	 Well....I don't know about its competing with 3D studio, but it's pretty powerful allright. 
comp.graphics	 Ahh no. Possibly you punched in the wrong numbers on your calculator. 256 color modes take a byte per pixel so 640 time 480 is 307,200 which is 300k to be exact. 640x400x256 only takes 250k but I don't think it is a BIOS mode. I wouldn't bet that all VGA cards can do that either. If a VGA card has 512k I bet it can do both 640x400 and 640x480. That by definition is SVGA, though not very high SVGA. 
comp.graphics	 Hi! I am working on a project that needs to create contour lines from random data points. The work that I have done so far tells me that I need to look into Triangulated Irregular Networks (TIN), the Delauney criiterion, and the Krige method. Does anyone have any suggestions for references, programs and hopefully source code for creating contours. Any help with this or any surface modeling would be greatly appreciated. I can be reached at the addresses below: 
comp.graphics	 The Delaunay triangulation is the geometrical dual of the Voronoi tessellation and both constructions are derived from natural neighbor order. 
comp.graphics	 Yes, that's known as "Bresenhams Run Length Slice Algorithm for Incremental lines". See Fundamental Algorithms for Computer Graphics, Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg 1985. 
comp.graphics	 I have seen several ray-traced scenes (from MTV or was it RayShade??) with stroked fonts appearing as objects in the image. The fonts/chars had color, depth and even textures associated with them. Now I was wondering, is it possible to do the same in POV?? 
comp.graphics	 I am looking for an algorithm to determine if a given point is bound by a polygon. Does anyone have any such code or a reference to book containing information on the subject ? 
comp.graphics	 Up until last week, I have been running POVray v1.0 on my 486/33 under DOS5 without any major problems. Over Easter I increased the memory from 4Meg to 8Meg, and found that POVray reboots the system every time under DOS5. I had a go at running POVray in a DOS window when running Win3.1 on the same system and it now works fine, even if a lot slower. I would like to go back to using POVray directly under DOS, anyone any ideas??? 
comp.graphics	 Does anyone know of any good shareware animation or paint software for an SGI machine? I've exhausted everyplace on the net I can find and still don't hava a nice piece of software. 
comp.graphics	 I'm interested in find out what is involved in processing pairs of stereo photographs. I have black-and-white photos and would like to obtain surface contours. 
comp.graphics	 Do you have Weitek's address/phone number? I'd like to get some information about this chip. 
comp.graphics	 I would like to know if anyone has had any luck using the upper 128 ASCII characters on a Sun station. I am trying to convert a fortran program to run on a Sun. When we write character buffers to the Sun which contain char(218) or char(196) or char(197) etc. We get characters on the screen but they are not the characters in the standard ASCII tables. 
comp.graphics	 Graeme tYes, that's known as "Bresenhams Run Length Slice Algorithm for Graeme Incremental lines". See Fundamental Algorithms for Computer Graphics, Graeme Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg 1985. 
comp.graphics	 I am looking for a package which takes as inputs a set of geometric objects defined by unions of convex polytopes specified in some manner, say by inequalities and equalities, and determines in some reasonable form things like intersections, unions, etc. etc.. 
comp.graphics	 See the article "An Efficient Ray-Polygon Intersection," p. 390 in Graphics Gems (ISBN 0-12-286165-5). The second step, intersecting the polygon, does what you want. There is sample code in the book. 
comp.graphics	 Which distance? The distance between one point (t = ti) on the first curve and a point on the other curve with same parameter (u = ti)? 
comp.graphics	 Well, it's been a while since this was discussed so i take the liberty of reprinting (without permission, so sue me) Eric Haines reprint of the very interesting discussion of this topic... 
comp.graphics	 Basically, there are two algorithms determining whether a point is inside, outside or on the polygon. The first one is Ray (or half line) method. In this method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection point of the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd, then it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which may make you headache. 
comp.graphics	 Unfortunately the poster wants to use an internal and an external modem so a switch isn't going to help them. If you aren't using your com ports for anything else, just define them on different com ports. Define your internal modem to be say, com1, and your external modem to be com3. You really shouldn't have to worry about interrupt conflicts since you won't be using both modems at the same time :). 
comp.graphics	 That's a typical claim, though they say they've improved compression speed considerably. Did you find out anything else about the book? I'd be interested in looking at it if you could give me any pointers. 
comp.graphics	 garbo.uwasa.fi (or one of its many mirrors) has a file called "svgabg40" in the programming subdirectory. These are svga bgi drivers for a variety of cards. 
comp.graphics	 Why so up tight? FOr that matter, TIFF6 is out now, so why not gripe about its problems? Also, if its so important to you, volunteer to help define or critique the spec. 
comp.graphics	 Has anyone successfully converted Interleaf graphics to CGM, or even heard of it being done???? 
comp.graphics	 thus the original problem. 
comp.graphics	 Hello HELP!!! please I am a student of turbo c++ and graphics programming and I am having some problems finding algorithms and code to teach me how to do some stuff.. 
comp.graphics	 Can someone give me the title of a good VGA graphics programming book? Please respond by email. Thanks! 
comp.graphics	 They were both fairly impressive. The first one was a 64 gray scale "movie" of Casablanca, it was 1.3MB and had 11 minutes of 13 fps video. It was a little grainy but not bad at all. The second one I saw was only 3 minutes but it had 8 bit color with 10fps and measured in at 1.2MB. 
comp.graphics	 Can You report CRT and other register state in this mode ?' "Thank's. 
comp.graphics	 This past week I've been playing with some of the R-D (Reaction- Diffusion, not to be confused with RDS or R&D) techniques from SIGGRAPH '91. 
comp.graphics	 I am looking for EISA or VESA local bus graphic cards that support at least 1024x786x24 resolution. I know Matrox has one, but it is very expensive. All the other cards I know of, that support that resoultion, are striaght ISA. 
comp.graphics	 Just as a matter of interest, a self-promo computer graphics sequence that one of the local TV stations used to play quite a lot a couple of years ago showed a 3D flyover of Australia from the West coast to the East. The clouds were quite recognisable as fuzzy, flat, white Mandlebrot sets!! 
comp.graphics	 Yes but a key issue is _SPEED_ how fast is Imagine? And is it as easy to use as 3D Studio? Can it just do a render as fast as 3DS if you don't want things like IOR etc.. 3DS can do fine shadows, animated reflection maps, animated bump maps, animated anything maps, and with the IPAS routines (Not that I've ever seen them) It can do explosions, top quality morphing, fire, rain, lens flares etc.. I'm not knocking imagine, I just want to know how it compares with 3DS 
comp.graphics	 Hi all! I've just recently become seriously hooked on POV, but there are a few thing that I want to do that POV won't do (penumbral shadows, dispersion etc.). I was just wondering: what other shareware/freeware raytracers are out there, and what can they do? I've heard of Vivid and Polyray and Rayshade and so on, but I'd rather no wade through several hundred pages of manual for each trying to work out what their capabilities are. Can anyone help? A comparison of tracing speed between each program would also be mucho useful. Mark. 
comp.graphics	 on nice shareware graphics programs. They looked pretty good and of the 6 listed in the article, one I had (Graphics Workshop), one I found via archie (Draft Choice - old version though) and the rest I couldn't find. So if there is anyone that knows where I can get the following programs via anonymous ftp, please let me know. 
comp.graphics	 I too would like a 3D graphics library! How much do C libraries cost anyway? Can you get the tools used by, say, RenderMan, and can you get them at a reasonable cost? 
comp.graphics	 Does anybody know what Delaunay Triangulation is? Is there any reference to it? Is it useful for creating 3-D objects? If yes, what's the advantage? 
comp.graphics	 Nope, this won't work for a cylinder. You can have a line arbitrarily close to the the cylinder backbone, and yet not intersect it. The test works for a pillbox, though. (a cylinder with two hemispheres attached at the ends.) 
comp.graphics	 I aparantly mistyped the address for the ftp site which holds the images. The correct address should be: 
comp.graphics	 I just got my advance program and the "card in the back" is for the Exhibits Plus program -- the exhibits plus admission to a number of conference venues, including a special general session, "Behind the Scenes: Computer Graphics in Film." Admission is not free, but is a nominal $30 (exhibits are open August 3 -- 5).

(dxf are good enough) does anyone have object to give me to complete my hard animation 
comp.graphics	 Apparantly you dont keep up on the news. 3DO was shown at CES to developers and others at private showings. Over 300 software licensees currently developing software for it. 
comp.graphics	 I've been given the sites of some excellent 3D objects on all sorts of file formats ... Here's where they are:

comp.graphics	 Has anybody compiled VOGL-graphics library for IBM-PC? I need to call it from MS-Fortran but don't have MS-C to compile the sources. 
comp.graphics	 I'm looking for a database called "Micro World Data Bank II", a database with digital map information containing 178,068 latitude, longitude points. It is said to be in the public domain. If anyone knows a place where I can get it (preferably FTP/gopher/mailserver etc.; otherwise snail mail) please let me know. I you have it yourself and are willing to send me the file, drop me a line. 
comp.graphics	 When using Photoshop is there anyway to get an elliptical dot for the halftone screen rather than a round dot ? My printer would prefer an elliptical dot, but I'm not sure how to set it up. I'm sending from a Mac IIci to a Linotronic L300 imagesetter and I am using Photoshop 2.0.1 to make my separations. 
comp.graphics	 No. That's *not* what I was complaining about, nor did I intend to suggest that DEC was any better than SGI (let me tell you about the Lynx some day, but be prepared with a large sedative if you do...). My comment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other vendors that supported OpenGL, rather than deal further with SGI. 
comp.graphics	 The following is extracted from sumex-aim.stanford.edu. It should also be on the mirrors. I think there is source for some applications that may have some bearing on your project. Poke around the source directory. I've never used this package, nor do I know anyone who did, but the price is right :-) 
comp.graphics	 Yes, there are serveral programs which can convert font files (eq the Borland fonts) to objects consisting of spheres, cones etc. I've used a program (forgot its name/place, but i can look for it) which converted these Borland fonts to three different raytracers. Vivid, POV and Polyray (which i like more (more flexibel/faster/use of expressions etc). The program has a lot nice features. So if interested give me a mail. 
comp.graphics	 Using the VMODE command, all you need to do is type VMODE VESA at the dos prompt. VMODE is included with the Speedstar 24. I have used the VESA mode for autodesk animator pro. 
comp.graphics	 I don't have nor Imagine nor Real 3d, but as old Amiga user I think you should take a look also to Real 3d 2.0 for the Amiga. I saw Imagine 2.0 on the Amiga for a long time at my friend's home, and I've seen R3D 2.0 in action at Bit.Movie 93 in Riccione, Italy (an Italian Computer Graphics Contest). Many professionals using 3d Studio on PC, SoftImage for Silicon Graphics and Imagine on the Amiga were *VERY IMPRESSED* by the power of this programs. Sorry, I've lost the posting with full description of features of this great program. 
comp.graphics	 What hardware do plan to run on? Workstation or PC? Cost level? Run-time licensing needs? 
comp.graphics	 Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some help with it. We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray level images. However, the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images. After some initial problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images just fine. I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the 256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs. This was not mentioned in the sales literature. However they did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they would call Japan, etc. 
comp.graphics	 I am looking for a program that is capable of displaying a graph with nodes and links and with the possibility to edit interactively the graph : add one node, change one link etc... 
comp.graphics	 Wow! A 68070! I'd be very interested to get my hands on one of these, especially considering the fact that Motorola has not yet released the 68060, which is supposedly the next in the 680x0 lineup. 8-D 
comp.graphics	 Hi, has anyone more info about the XGA-2 chipset? HW-funcs, TrueColor, Resolutions,... Any boards with XGA-2 out yet? 
comp.graphics	 OpenGL is a graphics programming library and as such is a great, portable interface for the development of interactive 3D graphics applications. It is not, however, an indicator of performance, as that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor. SGI is committed to high performance interactive graphics systems and software tools, so OpenGL means that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms, there is no guarantee that your performance would be comparable. 
comp.graphics	 Hello, I've been trying to bump map a gif onto a sphere for a while and I can't seem to get it to work. Image mapping works, but not bump mapping. Here's a simple file I was working with, could some kind soul tell me whats wrong with this..... 
comp.graphics	 This program doesn't detect edges with compass operators and a laplacian operator. It should output 2 raw grey-scale images with edges. The output doesn't look like edges at all. 
comp.graphics	 I don't think speed has been determined, since it has never run on Intel chips. But on the Amiga's Motorola Chips, it was one of the fastest true 'Ray Tracers' 
comp.graphics	 The Harvard Computer Society is pleased to announce its third lecture of the spring. Ivan Sutherland, the father of computer graphics and an innovator in microprocessing, will be speaking at Harvard University on Tuesday, April 20, 1993, at 4:00 pm in Aiken Computations building, room 101. The title of his talk is "Logical Effort and the Conflict over the Control of Information." 
comp.graphics	 Has ANYONE who has ordered the new PC version of Imagine ACTUALLY recieved it yet? I'm just about ready to order but reading posts about people still awaiting delivery are making me a little paranoid. Has anyone actually held this piece of software in their own hands? 
comp.graphics	 I searched the U Mich archives fairly thoroughly for 3D graphics packages, I always thought it to be a mirror of sumex-aim.stanford.edu... I was wrong. I'll look into GrafSys... it does sound interesting! 
comp.graphics	 Wouldn't this require a hyper-sphere. In 3-space, 4 points over specifies a sphere as far as I can see. Unless that is you can prove that a point exists in 3-space that is equi-distant from the 4 points, and this may not necessarily happen. 
comp.graphics	 It's not a bad question: I don't have any refs that list this algorithm either. But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard. 
comp.graphics	 I'm a mac user who wants to use some of the rayshade models I've built using macrayshade (rayshade-M) with Stratavision 3d. Since Stratavision can import many different model files I thought this would be a cinch... but I haven't been able to find a simple translator that will work on the mac. Any ideas?

comp.graphics	 The 68070 is a variation of the 68010 that was done a few years ago by the European partners of Motorola. It has some integrated I/O controllers and half a MMU, but otherwise it's a 68010. Think of it the same as the 8086 and 80186 were. 
comp.graphics	 Hi, would someone please email the new AVI file format. I'm sure that many people would like to know what it is exactly.

comp.graphics	 Hi to all out there. We have this problem, and I'm not certain I'm solving it in the correct way. I was wondering if anyone can shed light on this, or point me in the right place to look... 
comp.graphics	 Hi. I'm writing a program to convert .dxf files to a database format used by a 3D graphics program I've written. My program stores the points of a polygon in CCW order. I've used 3D Concepts a little and it seems that the points are stored in the order they are drawn. 
comp.graphics	 We have been using Iterated Systems compression board to compress pathology images and are getting ratios of 40:1 to 70:1 without too much loss in quality. It is taking about 4 mins per image to compress, on a 25Mhz 486 but decompression is almost real time on a 386 in software alone. 
comp.graphics	 Hello, I purchased my new 486 with a NoName graphics card installed which is obviously Speedstar 24 compatible. Its name is "VGA 4000 TrueColor". It is accompanied with some drivers and the utilities VMODE, XMODE and at least one more MODE, as well as some drivers for Lotus, Windows, etc. Only one of the drivers is told to provide the TrueColor mode, namely the Windows 3.1 driver. Nowhere else, except in the ad, is any pointer to the TrueColor mode. Some articles in this group about the Speedstar 24 and some other facts made me believe that my card is compatible to that one. 
comp.graphics	 The equation of the sphere through the 4 points (x1,y1,z1),...,(x4,y4,z4) is | x^2+y^2+z^2 x1^2+y1^2+z1^2 ... x4^2+y4^2+z4^2 | | x x1 ... x4 | | y y1 ... y4 | = 0 | z z1 ... z4 | | 1 1 ... 1 | When this 5 by 5 determininant is expanded on its first column you get the equation in the form A(x^2+y^2+z^2) + Bx + Cy + Dz + E = 0 If you need the center and radius, jyst divide through by A (it cannot be zero if the 4 given points form a non-degenerate tetrahedron) and complete the square on x, y, and z to obtain (x-xc)^2 + (y-yc)^2 + (z-zc)^2 = r^2 
comp.graphics	 I need a VESA driver for the Diamond Speedstar 24X that works. I've tried several and none work for the hicolor modes. 
comp.graphics	 There is a vast literature on Delaunay triangulations, literally hundreds of papers. A program is even provided with every copy of Mathematica nowadays. You might look at this if you are interested in using it for creating 3D objects: 
comp.graphics	 The 68070 _does_ exist. It's number was licensed to Philips to make their own variant. This chip includes extra featurfes such as more I/O ports, I2C bus... making it more microcontroller like. 
comp.graphics	 I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask this question. If not, please forgive me and point me in the right direction. 
comp.graphics	 The VESA standard can be requested from VESA: VESA 2150 North First Street, Suite 440 San Jose, CA 95131-2029 
comp.graphics	 It's really not that hard to do. There are books out there which explain everything, and the basic 3D functions, translation, rotation, shading, and hidden line removal are pretty easy. I wrote a program in a few weeks witht he help of a book, and would be happy to give you my source. Also, Quickdraw has a lot of 3D functions built in, and Think pascal can access them, and I would expect that THINK C could as well. If you can find out how to use the Quickdraw graphics library, it would be an excellent choice, since it has a lot of stuff, and is built into the Mac, so should be fast. 
comp.graphics	 What are the main advantages of this method? I have seen it described, and the algiorithm seems a little bit long. I developed my own method, which requires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order, and returns whether you are looking at the back or the front, similar to the plane eqn method. It uses few calculations however, basically it is several comparisons. The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the screen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand. My method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the screen are clockwise or counterclockwise. When looking at the back of something, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so merely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are looking at the back or front of a 2d polygon. Has anyone heard of this method before? It is so simple, I doubt i am the first to think of it. 
comp.graphics	 I have a few reprints left of chapters from my book "Visions of the Future". These include reprints of 3 chapters probably of interest to readers of this forum, including: 
comp.graphics	 I am looking for some good quality graphics files which are suitable for use in church-related presentations. I prefer vector, but anything would be helpful. 
comp.graphics	 Hi, I'm looking for the 3-D studio driver for the Oak card with 1 M of RAM. This would be GREATLY (and I mean that) appreciated 
comp.graphics	 Sorry Scott, if you post it here, you can read it here. There is a shareware program available via anonymous FTP that will suit your needs. You'll find it at OAK.OAKLAND.EDU in the subdirectory pub/msdos/graphics. The file is called "GRFWK61T.ZIP." 
comp.graphics	 I wanted to know if any of you out there can recommend a good book about graphics, still and animated, and in VGA/SVGA. 
comp.graphics	 Help! I'm trying to program my VGA! I've got it working with in pascal with the following routines for mode $13h (320*200*256). I've got a VESA compatable Trident 8900C w/1meg and need to program in 1024*768 mode. I don't care how many colors. 
comp.graphics	 I'm interested in simulating reverse (or negative) color video mathematically. What is the transform? Is it a simple reversal of the hue value in the HSV color space? Is it a manipulation in the YUV color space? How is it related to solarization? 
comp.graphics	 The problem is not precisely defined above, but if you need to find the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given polygon, then you are seeking the convex hull of your original polygon. There are two ways to do this: use a somewhat tricky but by-now well examined linear-time algorithm that exploits the polygon boundary, or just feed the vertices of the original polygon to a convex hull routine and accept O(n log n). Both methods are discussed in Preparata and Shamos, for example. 
comp.graphics	 I think he wanted to avoid reinventing the wheel. I would suggest that you take your code, and submit it to comp.sys.mac.binaries to be distributed (including to the ftp sites). Many folks, myself included, would enjoy the extra code. 
comp.graphics	 We are interested in purchasing a grayscale printer that offers a good resoltuion for grayscale medical images. Can anybody give me some recommendations on these products in the market, in particular, those under $5000? 
comp.graphics	 I was wondering if anyone knows where I can get more information about the graphics in the WingCommander series, and the RealSpace system they use. I think it's really awesome, and wouldn't mind being able to use similar features in programs. Thanks in advance. 
comp.graphics	 I used the information provided in the recent resource listings and tried to ftp to:

comp.graphics	 I think APDA has something called MacWireFrame which is a full wire-frame (and supposedly hidden-line removal) library. I think it weighs in at $99 (but I've been wrong on an order of magnitude before) 
comp.graphics	 To everyone who wants fonts in Vivid/POV/Polyray. The Borland BGI font converter is VVFONT18.ZIP. This program can be found on FTP.INFORMATIK.UNI-OLDENBURG.DE directory pub/dkbtrace/utils. Also WUARCHIVE has mirrored this site (directory graphics/graphics/mirrors/ ftp.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de/pub/dkbtrace/utils. There are more nice utilities present in this directory. A new version of Polyray 1.6 (for those asked for it) can be found on the same sites but in the directory INCOMING instead of UTILS (PLY16386). Also in this directory POVSHELL and PV3DV060 could be found. Have a nive raytrace time. Peter 
comp.graphics	 I am working on a project where we are going to be including both still and moving grapics within a database. Of course JPEG and MPEG come to mind as the formats of choice for the various files. However, from what I read on the Net, it seems as if there are several different forms of each of these. 
comp.graphics	 I am looking for a public domain 3d viewer. It does not have to be very fancy. The features I want is simple wireframe display, flat shading, simple transformation. It would be nice to have hidden line. 
comp.graphics	 No, VGALIB? Amazing.. I guess it was lost in all those subdirs :-) Thanks for correcting me. It doesn't sound very appealing though, only 320x200? I'm glad it wasn't something major I missed. 
comp.graphics	 Sorry, Bryan, this is not quite correct. Remember the VGALIB package that comes with Linux/SLS? It will switch to VGA 320x200x256 mode *without* Xwindows. So at least it is *possible* to write a GIF viewer under Linux. However I don't think that there exists a similar SVGA package, and viewing GIFs in 320x200 is not very nice. 
comp.graphics	 I need to get the specs, or at least a very verbose interpretation of the specs, for QuickTime. Technical articles from magazines and references to books would be nice too. 
comp.graphics	 OK, I don't use CView anymore, but I saw that no one had explaind this "bug" in the thread, so here goes: 
comp.graphics	 This may be a fairly routine request on here, but I'm looking for a fast polygon routine to be used in a 3D game. I have one that works right now, but its very slow. Could anyone point me to one, pref in ASM that is fairly well documented and flexible? Thanx, //Lucas. 
comp.graphics	 A 68070 is just a 68010 with a built in MMU. I don't even think that Moto. manufactures them. 
comp.graphics	 The 3DO box is based on an ARM RISC processor, one or two custom graphics chips, a DSP, a double-speed CDROM, and 2MB of RAM/VRAM. (I'm a little fuzzy on the breakdown of the graphics chips and RAM/VRAM capacity). 
comp.graphics	 To draw polygons of course. Its a VGA mode 13h (320x200) game, done in C and ASM. I need a faster way to draw concave polygons that the method I have right now, which is very slow. //Lucas. 
comp.graphics	 Tommy Frandsen's VGAlib (which is probably what you're talking about) will do the standard VGA modes, some tweaked modes and then the Tseng ET4000 Super VGA modes. I have an ET4000 and I'm viewing GIF's at 640x480/256 (I have a lousy/small monitor) with dpg-view on Linux. I think I had to change some constants in the dpg-view sources to make it use the ET4k modes. 
comp.graphics	 I'm using "rayshade" on the u.w. computers here, and i'd like input from other users, and perhaps swap some ideas. I could post uuencoded .gifs here, or .ray code, if anyone's interested. I'm having trouble coming up with colors that are metallic (i.e. brass, steel) from the RGB values. 
comp.graphics	 The most ridiculous example of VR-exploitation I've seen so far is the "Virtual Reality Clothing Company" which recently opened up in Vancouver. As far as I can tell it's just another "chic" clothes spot. Although it would be interesting if they were selling "virtual clothing".... 
comp.graphics	 I'm getting ready to buy a multimedia workstation and would like a little advice. I need a graphics card that will do video in and out under windows. I was originally thinking of a Targa+ but that doesn't work under Windows. What cards should I be looking into? 
comp.graphics	 Acorn Replay running on a 25MHz ARM 3 processor (the ARM 3 is about 20% slower than the ARM 6) does this in software (off a standard CD-ROM). 16 bit colour at about the same resolution (so what if the computer only has 8 bit colour support, real-time dithering too...). The 3D0/O is supposed to have a couple of DSPs - the ARM being used for housekeeping. 
comp.graphics	 PC Magazine seems to be impressed with the ATI card in their most recent reviews. In the April 13th issue they rate the ATI Graphics Ultra Pro (EISA version) as their "Editor's Choice". They noted that the drivers had improved since they tested the ISA version in January... ...Cuyler

comp.graphics	 Well, the temp file thing creates an obvious problem: it is impossible to use cview for viewing CD-ROM based picture collections. And it is the ONLY non- windows viewer that works properly with my Cirrus-based 24 bit VGA. 
comp.graphics	 re: majority of users not readding from floppy. Well, how about those of us who have 1400-picture CD-ROMS and would like to use CVIEW because it is fast and it works well, but can't because the moron lacked the foresight to create the temp file in the program's path, not the current didrectory? 
comp.graphics	 Looking for a graphics/CAD/or-whatever package on a X-Unix box that will take a file with records like:

comp.graphics	 Can somebody point out to me where I can find the specs for .GL and .FLI files found on PC's? 
comp.graphics	 Check out Image Pals v1.2 from U-Lead (until May, special $99 intro price, 310-523-9393). It has the basic image processing tools for all major formats, does screen grabbing, and allows all your image files to be calalogged into a thumbnail database. It's great! 
comp.graphics	 Okay all my friends are bitching at me that the map I made in Appsoft Draw can't be displayed in "xv"... I checked... It's true, at least with version 1.0. My readers on the NeXT have very little trouble on it (Preview messes up the .eps, but does fine with the TIFF and ImageViewer0.9a behaves with flying colors except it doesn't convert worth *&^^% ;-) ) 
comp.graphics	 Yesterday I wrote a program to do bilinear interpolation ala Numerical Recipes, with the PBMPLUS libraries. I'm pretty happy with the results, but I'm looking for any already-coded non-linear interpolation schemes before I go ahead an try to write one. Any pointers? 
comp.graphics	 Yeah - they also gave it their "Editor's Choice" in the run-down of graphics accelerators they tested in the previous issue, which is why I bought (and then returned) mine. The only conclusion I can come up with is that PC Magazine has wildly different ways on determining the worthiness of a video card than I do. 
comp.graphics	 I am involve in a Distant Learning project and am in need of Jpeg and Mpeg encode/decode source and object code. This is a NOT-FOR PROFIT project that once completed I hope to release to other educational and institutional learning centers. This project requires that TRUE photographic images be sent over plain telephone lines. In addition if there is a REAL Good GUI lib with 3D objects and all types of menu classes that can be use at both end of the transaction (Server and Terminal End) I would like to hear about it. 
comp.graphics	 A while back someone had several equations which could be used for changing 3 f iltered grey scale images into one true color image. This is possible because it's the same theory used by most color scanners. I am not looking for the obv ious solution which is to buy a color scanner but what I do need is those equat ions becasue I am starting to write software which will automate the conversion process. I would really appreciate it if someone would repost the 3 equations /3 unknowns. Thanks for the help!!! 
comp.graphics	 I'm making a customized paint program in DOS and need an algorithm for reading bitmap files like GIF, PCX, or BMP. Does anyone have such an algorithm? I've tried copying one out of a book for reading .PCX format but it doesn't work. I will take an algorithm for any format that can be created from Windows Paint. Thanks! Toni 
comp.graphics	 I am looking for some graphic images of earth shot from space. ( Preferably 24-bit color, but 256 color .gif's will do ). 
comp.graphics	 Excuse the sheer newbieness of this post, but I am looking for a decent PaintProgram which will save to various file formats (.BMP .PCX etc etc) via ftp, freeware, or shareware. I would like to check out the available programs for little $$ before I check out the commercial market. 
comp.graphics	 SVGA graphics? I know there are lots of graphics-board companies out there, as well as several graphics chips manufacturers- are they adhering to the VESA standard, and what effect is/will the VESA Local Bus have on all of this? Anyone? 
comp.graphics	 Could anyone direct me to the FTP site where I can find the DOS-based morphing package called DMORF12.ZIP? I had downloaded this file last week, but the new DOS 6 crashed my hard drive and I lost it. Now I can't find the site where I got it from....... 
comp.graphics	 I plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as I have working code, which I will also include. The intersection of 3 planes method looks best, but my implementation based on a short article in Graphics Gems I doesn't work. I may be misinterpreting, of course. 
comp.graphics	 Having thought about this, why don't you project the 2 lines onto the 2d plane formed by the lines. Do an intersection calculation in the plane in 2D, where you're guaranteed a unique solution (unless they're parallel which won't happen in this case), and then use parametric distance along the lines from the circle centres to determine the exact point of interest. This bypasses the messy error propogation required to do the calculation in 3d. 
comp.graphics	 I've borrowed the 1992-93 version of this book from a friend...holy moley! What a wealth of contacts. Five-hundred pages of information about electronic artists and organizations around the globe (many have email addresses). An up to the minute database of this information is also available on Minitel (the book's based in France...are there any Internet=Minitel gates?). The book is printed in French and English. 
comp.graphics	 Try FTP-ing at pub-info.jpl.nasa.gov (128.149.6.2) (simple dir-structure) 
comp.graphics	 Why would it have to be much faster (it probably is) ? Assuming an ARM is about as efficient as a MIPS R3000 for integer calculations, doing a Compact-Video-like digital video codec is an easy task. For Software Motion Pictures (which is a lot like Compact Video, though it predates it), we get 48 frames/sec. at 320x240 on a DECstation 5000/200. That machine has a 25 Mhz MIPS R3000. 
comp.graphics	 Good I had a bad feeling about this problem because of a special case with no solution that worried me. 
comp.graphics	 Look in the /pub/SPACE directory on ames.arc.nasa.gov - there are a number of earth images there. You may have to hunt around the subdirectories as things tend to be filed under the mission (ie, "APOLLO") rather than under the image subject. 
comp.graphics	 A stupid question, but what will CView run on and where can I get it? I am still in need of a GIF viewer for Linux. (Without X-Windows.) Thanks! 
comp.graphics	 Ho boy. There is no way in HELL you are going to be able to view GIFs or do any other graphics in Linux without X windows! I love Linux because it is so easy to learn.. You want text? Okay. Use Linux. You want text AND graphics? Use Linux with X windows. Simple. Painless. REQUIRED to have X Windows if you want graphics! This includes fancy word processors like doc, image viewers like xv, etc. 
comp.graphics	 from Floppy drives? I haven't tried it with JPEGs, but I do realize how agonizingly slow it is with GIF files. 
comp.graphics	 I have to beg to differ on this point, as the batch file I use to launch cview cd's to the dir where cview resides and then invokes it. every time I crash cview, the 0-byte temp file is found in the root dir of the drive cview is on. 
comp.graphics	 Help!! I need code/package/whatever to take 3-D data and turn it into a wireframe surface with hidden lines removed. I'm using a DOS machine, and the code can be in ANSI C or C++, ANSI Fortran or Basic. The data I'm using forms a rectangular grid. Please post your replies to the net so that others may benefit. IMHO, this is a general interest question. Thank you!!!!!! 
comp.graphics	 Just posting to John Cormack. I wanted to tell you that there is a "slight" difference between Speedstar 24 and Speedstar 24X 
comp.graphics	 Does anyone know of a good way (standard PC application/PD utility) to convert tif/img/tga files into LaserJet III format. We would also like to do the same, converting to HPGL (HP plotter) files. 
comp.graphics	 I have a problem with intersections between two surfaces. Does anybody have a easy to understand algorithm for that or maybe even C source?? 
comp.graphics	 What about the ELSA WINNER4000 (S3 928, Bt485, 4MB, EISA), or the Metheus Premier-4VL (S3 928, Bt485, 4MB, ISA/VL) ? 
comp.graphics	 I've recently got hold of a PC with an S3 card in it, and I'd like to do some C programming with it, are there any libraries out there that will let me access the high resolution modes available via Borland Turbo C? 
comp.graphics	 Peter, there's a radiosity package ahead. The only problem is: there are a few miles to sail ... ;-^ 
comp.graphics	 Hi,' "See Roger Grywalski's response to : 
comp.graphics	 First off: Thanks to all who have filled me in on the existence of the 68070. I assumed rashly that the particular number would be reserved for further enhancements to the Motorola line, rather than meted out to another company. Ah, well, I guess that's what I get when I assume the computer industry will operate in a logical manner! ;-) 
comp.graphics	 For those of you who don't need 24 bit, I got a 32 colour Amiga IFF of a cloudless Earth (scanned). Looks okay when mapped on a sphere. E-mail me and I'll send it you... 
comp.graphics	 Let's say you have a scanned image of a line drawing; in this case a boat, but it could be anything. On the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true x,y positions are known. 
comp.graphics	 This sounds wonderful, but it seems no one either wants to spend time doing this, or they don't have the power to do so. For example, I would like 
comp.graphics	 Ummm, I beg to differ. A kind soul sent me a program called DPG-VIEW that will do exactly what I want, view GIF images under Linux without X-Windows. And, it does support all the way up to 1024x768. The biggest complaint I have is it is painfully SLOW. It takes about 1 minute to display an image. I am use to CSHOW under DOS which takes a split second. Any idea why it is so slow under Linux? Anybody have anything better? Plus, anybody have the docs to DPG-View? Thanks! 
comp.graphics	 I'm afraid your reply didn't get thru. I do appreciate you trying to reply, however. Please try again. 
comp.graphics	 I think you are too optimistic! PostScript is a very big language and so the fig format can not be able to be an interpreter of ANY arbitrary ps code. The only program I know to manipulate PostScript files is IslandDraw. I for myself use xfig and include the PostScript files (converted to epsi format). Small changes then are possible (erasing some letters, adding text and so on). Reinhard 
comp.graphics	 I understand there have been a couple of raves in LA billing themselves as "Virtual Reality" parties. What I hear they do is project .GIF images around on the walls, as well as run animations through a Newtek Toaster. 
comp.graphics	 It helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at least a reasonable model of the class of distortion. Below is a very short description of the process which we use; if you have further questions, feel free to poke me via e-mail. 
comp.graphics	 About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult. I am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published solutions to it. 
comp.graphics	 Does anybody have an algorithm for "flattening" out a globe, or any other parametric surface, that is definied parametrically. That is, I would like to take a sheet of paper and a knife and to be able to calculate how I must cut in the paper so I can fold it to a globe (or any other object). 
comp.graphics	 Beware. There is only one such *copyrighted* image and the company that generated is known to protect that copyright. That image took hundreds of man-hours to build from the source satellite images, so it is unlikely that competing images will appear soon. 
comp.graphics	 Concerning the proposed newsgroup split, I personally am not in favor of doing this. I learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading this group, from code to hardware to algorithms. I just think making 5 different groups out of this is a wate, and will only result in a few posts a week per group. I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum for discussing all aspects of graphics. Anyone else feel this way? Just curious. 
comp.graphics	 Help! How do you write to the second bank/page of memory when in VGA 320x200x256 colour mode?. ie: to perform page flipping animation and buffering of the screen. I have tried using the Map Mask Registers, but this does not perform the required task (Although it does do something). 
comp.graphics	 Hello again netters, I finally received the information about Imagine for the PC. They are presently shipping Version 2.0 of the software and will release Version 3.0 in the first quarter of 1993 (or so they say). The upgrade from 2.0 to 3.0 is $100.00. To purchase Imagine 2.0, it costs $495.00 or if you are upgrading from another eligible (call them for info) modeler, it is only $200.00 plus shipping & handling. It requires a PC with 4 Megs a Math Coprocessor, and Dos 5.0 or up and a Microsoft Mouse and SVGA card. Thanks for all your replies about the product. I have received many contrasting replies, but once I scrounge the money together, I think I will take the plunge. Thanks again. Here is the info for Impulse if you want to find out more or get the sheet they sent. Impulse Inc. 8416 Xerxes Avenue North Minneapolis, MN 55444 1-800-328-0184 
comp.graphics	 Does anyone know the phone number to a place where i can get a VGA passthrough? 
comp.graphics	 I'm looking for any information on detecting and/or calculating a double point and/or cusp in a bezier curve. 
comp.graphics	 Getting an image from a computer monitor to a videotape is harder than it looks. The standard VGA and EGA outputs are very different than the NTSC format used by televisions. While there is equipment that will do the conversion, it is hard to get your hands on and costs quite a bit. 
comp.graphics	 Actually the most flexible way to create temp files is to check for a TEMP or TMP environment variable and create the files on the drive and directory pointedto by the variable. This is pretty much a standard for DOS, Windows and OS/2 applications. 
comp.graphics	 There was a very useful article in one of the 1989 issues of Transactions On Graphics. I believe Maureen Stone was one of the authors. Sorry not to be more specific. I don't have the reference here with me. 
comp.graphics	 AT&T also puts out two new products for windows, Model numbers elude me now, a 15 bit video board with framegrabber and a 16bit with same. Yesterday I was looking at a product at a local Software ETC store. Media Vision makes a 15bit (32,768 color) frame capture board that is stand alone and doesnot use the feature connector on your existing video card. It claims upto 30 fps live capture as well as single frame from either composite NTSC or s-video in and out. 
comp.graphics	 I need some help. We are upgrading our animation/video editing stand. We are looking into the different type of setups for A/B roll and a cuts only station. We would like this to be controlled by a computer ( brand doesnt matter but maybe MAC, or AMIGA). Low end to high end system setups would be very helpful. If you have a system or use a system that might be of use, could you mail me your system requirements, what it is used for, and all the hardware and software that will be necessary to set the system up. If you need more info, you can mail me at eylerken@u.washington.edu 
comp.graphics	 If you have the GRASP animation system, then yes, it's quite easy. You simply use GLIB to extract the image (each "frame" in a .GL is actually a complete .PCX or .CLP file), then use one of MANY available utilities to convert it. If you don't have the GRASP package, I'm afraid I can't help you. Sorry. By the way, before you ask, GRASP (GRaphics Animation System for Professionals) is a commercial product that sells for just over US$300 from most mail-order companies I've seen. And no, I don't have it. :) 
comp.graphics	 I spoke with the author of MacWireFrame earlier today. The cost is $299, but there are no license royalties. His name is Eric Johnson in Sacramento, CA phone 916/737-1550. He doesn't have email. Very nice guy... very knowledgeable about graphics. Seems like he may have a decent package. It's an Object Pascal Framework that supposedly has a fairly complete set of geometry creation classes. I'm going to check it out and see if it's got what I need for my CAD package. 
comp.graphics	 Yes, I want to concentrate on other development issues - I've created graphics libraries before, it's too time consuming... life's too short! 
comp.graphics	 Don't get too excited; Signetics, not Motorola, gave the 68070 its number. The 68070, if I understand rightly, uses the 68000 instruction set, and has an on-chip serial port and DMA. (It will run at up to 15 MHz--I'm typing at a computer using a 68070 running at that rate, so I know that it can do so--so I seriously doubt the clock rate that ricardo@rchland.vnet.ibm.com claims.) 
comp.graphics	 Please , I need the starting address (pointer) for the beginning of the color information (RGB) on VGA mode 68h (that's 68 hex, gee, duh!)...

comp.graphics	 Hi ... Recently I found XV for MS-DOS in a subdirectory of GNU-CC (GNUISH). I use frequently XV on a Sun Spark Station 1 and I never had problems, but when I start it on my computer with -h option, it display the help menu and when I start it with a GIF-File my Hard disk turns 2 or 3 seconds and the prompt come back. 
comp.graphics	 The idea is to clip one polygon using another polygon (not necessarily rectangular) as a window. My problem then is in finding out all the new vertices of the resulting "subpolygons" from the first one. Is this simply a matter of extending the usual algorithm whereby each of the edges of one polygon is checked against another polygon??? Is there a simpler way?? 
comp.graphics	 Greetings all. According to a FAQ I read, on 30 July 1992, Joshua C. Jensen posted an article on bitmap manipulation (specifically, scaling and perspective) to the newsgroup rec.games.programmer. (article 7716) The article included source code in Turbo Pascal with inline assembly language. 
comp.graphics	 I am trying to convert an m-motion (IBM) video file format YUV to RGB data... 
comp.graphics	 I would like to program Tseng ET4000 to nonstandard 1024x768 mode by switching to standard 1024x768 mode using BIOS and than changing some timing details (0x3D4 registers 0x00-0x1F) but I don't know how to select 36 MHz pixel clock I need. The BIOS function selects 40 MHz. 
comp.graphics	 Try xviewgl. (filename xviewgl_v1.1.tar.Z on lots of bases) 
comp.graphics	 I have a Diamond Speedstar 24X board that I want to program for 24 bit 640x480 graphics, or possibly 800x600 16 bit color. Does anybody have any libraries supporting these modes on this board? Even somes simple routines to set the graphics mode and plot individual pixels would be a great help. I plan to use the routines with djgp. 
comp.graphics	 please tell me where you where you FTP'd this from? I would like to have a copy of it. (I would have mailed you, but your post indicates you have no mail address...) 
comp.graphics	 Just because the 68070 can run upto 15Mhz doesn't mean the CD-I is running at that speed. I said - I understand it is a 68070 running at something like 7Mhz. I am not sure, but I think I read this a long time ago. 
comp.graphics	 CH Concerning the proposed newsgroup split, I personally am not in CH favor of doing this. I learn an awful lot about all aspects of CH graphics by reading this group, from code to hardware to CH algorithms. I just think making 5 different groups out of this CH is a wate, and will only result in a few posts a week per group. CH I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum for CH discussing all aspects of graphics. Anyone else feel this way? CH Just curious. 
comp.graphics	 I've got the 6.0 spec (obviously since I quoted it in my last posting). My gripe about TIFF is that it's far too complicated and nearly infinitely easier to write than to read, which I think hurts your acceptance by anything that will need to read those images (e.g., paint programs). 
comp.graphics	 There is a new version of the RTrace ray-tracing package (8.2.0) at asterix.inescn.pt [192.35.246.17] in directory pub/RTrace. Check the README file. 
comp.graphics	 So they should sue the newspaper I got it from for printing it. The article didn't say anything about copyrights. 
comp.graphics	 Hi, It might be nice to know, what's possible on different hard ware platforms. But usually the hard ware is fixed ( in my case either Unix or DOS- PC ). So I'm not much interested in Amiga news. 
comp.graphics	 Guess the subject says it all. I would like references to any introductory material on Image Databases. Please send any pointers to mini@point.cs.uwm.edu 
comp.graphics	 We have a minivas-2 and we want to record to an Abekas A66. We have most of the functions working but when we go to set up a record the minivas hangs. We are sending the abekas SMPTE time code. Does anyone have code we can compare to what we have done and is there and ftp site for minivas and abekas code.

comp.graphics	 There are several public domain utilities available at your usual archive site that allow 'extraction' of single frames from a .gl file, check in the 'graphics' directories under *grasp. The problem is that the .clp files you generate cannot be decoded by any of the many pd format converters I have used. Any hint welcome! Let me know if you have problems locating the utilities. Hope it helps. 
comp.graphics	 Douglas Adams once said (paraphrased from memory): "I just picked it. It seemed like the sort of number you wouldn't be afraid to take home to meet your parents. Nice and even, perfectly normal." 
comp.graphics	 I would guess that it requires X, almost certainly DV/X, which commonly uses the GO32 (DJGPP) setup for its programs. If you don't have DV/X running, you can't get anything which requires interfacing with X. 
comp.graphics	 Does anybody know where I can get, via anonymous ftp or otherwise, a PostScript driver for the graphics libraries GINO verison 3.0A ? 
comp.graphics	 I have a Paradise SVGA with 1Mb, the 90c030 chip (1D). The docs say that I can display the following modes : 640x480x32k colours and 800x600x32k cols if I have the RAMDAC HiColor Chip. I have checked the board and I do have such a chip. Now, the problem is that I can't get this mode to work ! Graphics Workshop 6.1 claims that it can display 24 bit images dithered down to 15 bit colour with my board, but it doesn't work. I have tried writing some assembler code to get the modes working and I have found out that each pixel is addressed by a word ( 16 bit ), but only the lower 8 bits are considered ( this happens in 800x600 mode, the 640x480 mode refuses to work i.e. remains in text mode ). Could someone please help me. 
comp.graphics	 I am currently using POVRay on Mac and was wondering if anyone in netland knows of public domain anti-aliasing utilities so that I can skip this step in POV, very slow on this machine. Any suggestions, opinions about post-trace anti-aliasing would be greatly appreciated. 
comp.graphics	 Has anybody gotten CVIEW to work in 32k or 64k color mode on a Trident 8900c hi-color card? At best the colors come out screwed up, and at worst the program hangs. I loaded the VESA driver, and the same thing happens on 2 different machines. 
comp.graphics	 I'm not sure if you got the information you were looking for, so I'll post it anyway for the general public. To load an image on your root window add this line to the end of your .xsession file: 
comp.graphics	 Sorry for the repeat of this request, but does anyone know of a good free/shareware program with which I can create ray-traces and save them as bit-mapped files? (Of course if there is such a thing =) 
comp.graphics	 I'm sure the whole newspaper is copyrighted. They could have gotten permission to use the image under their own copyright. 
comp.graphics	 Geosphere Company, then there is a likelihood permission is has been given to reprint. 
comp.graphics	 I downloaded an image of the earth re-constructed from elevation data taken at 1/2 degree increments. The author (not me) wrote some c-code (included) that read in the data file and generated b&w and pseudo color images. They work very well and are not incumbered by copyright. They are at an aminet site near you called earth.lha in the amiga/pix/misc area... 
comp.graphics	 It depends on what kind of the polygons. Convex - simple, concave - trouble, concave with loop(s) inside - big trouble. 
comp.graphics	 The newspaper itself is almost certainly copyrighted in its entirety. Newspapers generally employ legal staffs which make sure they get permission to use a copyrighted image or text. Did you do the same? 
comp.graphics	 That's closer, but I dislike "apps". "software" (vs. "hardware") would be better. Would that engulf alt.graphics.pixutils? Or would that be "programmer"? 
comp.graphics	 Here at Lewis and Clark College we have recently installed a Digital Film system (based on the Mac Quadra) that does non-linear, full digital editing. 
comp.graphics	 Here is some text users of XV might find interesting. I have added more to text to this collection article, so read on, even you so my articles a while ago. 
comp.graphics	 Actuallay I don't, but on the other hand I don't support the idea of having one newsgroup for every aspect of graphics programming as proposed by Brian, in his reply to my original posting. The reason for making as few groups as possible is for the same reason you say we shouldn't spilt up, not to get to few postings every day. I takes to much time to browse through all postings just to find two or three I'm interested in. 
comp.graphics	 Visual Numerics Inc. (formerly IMSL and Precision Visuals) is in the process of securing sites for beta testing X Exponent Graphics 1.0 and C Exponent Graphics 2.0. (Both X Exponent Graphics and C Exponent Graphics are 3GL products). The beta period is from April 26 through June 18. The platform is HP9000/700 running under OS 8.07 with ansi C 8.71 compiler. The media will be sent on 4mm DAT cartridge tape. Here are some of the key facts about the two products. 
comp.graphics	 I don't know what kind of machine you want it for, but the program Radiance comes with 'C' source code - I don't have ftp access so I couldn't tell you where to get it via that way. 
comp.graphics	 Does anyone know of software that will allow you to convert CorelDraw (.CDR) files containing bitmaps to SCODAL, as this is the only format our bureau's filmrecorder recognises. 
comp.graphics	 What kind of polygons? Shaded? Texturemapped? Hm? More comes into play with fast routines than just "polygons". It would be nice to know exaclty what system (VGA is a start, but what processor?) and a few of the specifics of the implementation. You need to give more info if you want to get any answers! :P 
comp.graphics	 Are you using the traditional radiosity method, progressive refinement, or something else in your package? 
comp.graphics	 At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book, called out "Silence!" and read out from his book "Rule Forty-two. All persons more than a mile high to leave the court." Everybody looked at Alice. "I'm not a mile high," said Alice. "You are," said the King. "Nearly two miles high," added the queen. "Well, I sha'n't go, at any rate," said Alice; "besides, that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now." "It's the oldest rule in the book," said the King. "Then it ought to be Number One," said Alice.

comp.graphics	 I got the univesa driver available over the net. I thought that finally my 1-meg oak board would be able to show 680x1024 256 colors. Unfortunately a program still says that I can't do this. Is it the fault of the program (fractint) or is there something wrong with my card. univesa- a free driver available over the net that makes many boards vesa compatible. 
comp.graphics	 I sent off for my copy today... Snail Mail. Hope to get it back in about ten days. (Impulse said "a week".) 
comp.graphics	 I don't want texture mapped, cause if I did I'd asked for them. :) Just a simple and fast routine to do filled polygons. As for the processor, it'd be for a minimum of a 286... maybe 386 if I can't find a good one for 286s. Ideally, I want a polyn function that can clip to a user-defined viewport, and write to an arbitrary location in memory. Of course the chances of finding something like that are pretty remote, so I guess I'd need the source with it. Oh, and I guess it would need to be in ASM otherwise it'd be too slow. I've seen some polygon routines in C, and they've all been waaay too slow. Its for a 3D vector graphics program. I've been hunting high and low for a polyn function in ASM, and I can't find one anywhere that I can use. I've found one or two polyn functions, but my ASM is pretty bad, so I won't even try to rewrite them. :) //Lucas. 
comp.graphics	 Could someone please help me find a program or figure out how to extract a li st of R G B values for each pixel in an image. I can convert between tga and s everal other popular formats but I need the R G B values for use in a program I am writing. Thanks for the help 
comp.graphics	 Hi, I've come across a fast triangle fill-draw routine for mode 13h. By calling this routine enough times, you have a fast polygon drawing routine. 
comp.graphics	 I am working on a program to display 3d wireframe models with the user being able to arbitrarily change any of the viewing parameters. Also, the wireframe objects are also going to have dynamic attributes so that they can move around while the user is "exploring" the wireframe world. 
comp.graphics	 It should have been made fairly clear that the *most* Crimson would ever get was a 150 (75 old style) MHz CPU upgrade. Certainly this was mentioned on comp.sys.sgi on more than one occasion as being likely. If our sales folks were saying otherwise, they were either confused, or less than honest/ethical, or somebody further up the chain inside SGI was misleading them.

comp.graphics	 Our shop uses a package called CADCore - very good - to scan and subsequently vectorize original maps into digital maps. The problem is that once the raster file is loaded into the CADCore package, a header is added to the .HRF file which makes it unreadable by the supplied converter. We would like to be able to ship some of the already-altered raster images for further use on our workstations. So, here are my questions:

comp.graphics	 Yes I am aware CorelDraw exports in SCODAL. Version 2 did it quite well, apart from a few hassles with radial fills. Version 3 RevB is better but if you try to export in SCODAL with a bitmap image included in the drawing it will say something like "cannot export SCODAL with bitmap"- at least it does on my version. If anyone out there knows a way around this I am all ears. Temporal images make a product called Filmpak which converts Autocad plots to SCODAL, postscript to SCODAL and now GIF to SCODAL but it costs $650 and I was just wondering if there was anything out there that just did the bitmap to SCODAL part a tad cheaper.

When I exit from it it says my current driver can handle on 32768 colors when I am actually in 1024x768x65000 color mode. Is this a driver problem, a GWS error, or what? I am using the 1.5(59) driver under Win 3.1. It correctly states that I can display 16M colors when I switch to 800x600x24bit, though. Another question- Anybody know of any Viewers that support this card other than Windows viewers? Any help would be appreciated. 
comp.graphics	 An review of both the Mac and Windows versions in either PC Week or Info World this week, said that the Windows version was considerably slower than the Mac. A more useful comparison would have been between PhotoStyler and PhotoShop for Windows. David

comp.graphics	 Scott, I'm not so sure if this is helpful, but I usually use XV v2.21. I use Sun IPCs and IPXs, and it works fine. It can display in a good number of ways.(root being one of them) It's also possible to have XV put up a background automatically at login. Hope this helps. 
comp.graphics	 I have a routine that changes the color (RGB) attributes on my VGA adapter, but it doesn't work in the mode that I need. Specifically 68 hex. An obscure mode, of course, but I need to change the zillions of colors to 64 shade greyscale, but I do not have the correct memory address for the pointer I need. 
comp.graphics	 I don't know about that...I've used Photoshop 2.5 on both a 486dx-50 and a Quadra 950...I'd say they are roughly equal. If anything the 486 was faster.

comp.graphics	 Have you checked out Adobe Illustrator? There are a few Unix versions for it available, depending on your platform. I know of two Unix versions: One for Mach (NeXT) and for Irix (SGI). There may be others, such as for Sun SparcStation, but I don't know for sure. 
comp.graphics	 I've been trying to figure out a way to get Adobe Illustrator to auto-trace exactly< what I see on my screen. But it misses the edges of templates by as many as 6 pixels or more - resulting in images that are useless - I need exact tracing, not approximate. 
comp.graphics	 A very good modeling package I found is `irit' (look for irit.tar.Z). However there is no converter from it's format to POV format. I postet a request for such a converter in this group but got no response, so I'm considering to write such a program myself. 
comp.graphics	 I've got a 386 20Hz computer which is under warranty and my Trident 8900C video card is starting to play-up (surprise, surprise). Therefore I'm going to try to exchange it for a better card. 
comp.graphics	 For some reason I never saw the original post on this thread, but if you are looking for fast polygon routines on vga on a PC, you really can't go past the mode X stuff from Dr Dobbs. This code is all p.domain (as far as I know), and in the original articles, the routines were all presented as dumb vga routines, and then optimised to modeX with some interesting discussion along the way. If you are interested, I could find out more details of the issues in question, (I have them at home).

comp.graphics	 I bought the diamond stealth 24 a few months ago. it seems to be a great card especially with my multimedia presentations. It runs graphics and animation as well as some near full motion video very well. The only thing I can tell that it lacks is speed above 256 colors. Its qualit in between 256 and 16.7 million collors un unreal but you definitly compromise speed. It seems to be a great card for graphics and it comes with some great software, but Im not so sure about the excelerator part. I used to own a paridise and it doesnt seem to be much faster than that. One thing I do like is that it loads its own vesa driver from ROM at startup, (I think) because I have never had to load it for links386 or any other programs that require special VESA drivers at startup.

comp.graphics	 I think one (not ideal) solution is to use the tracing utility (can't remember the name, sorry!) included in the Corel Draw s/w pack. It can convert bitmaps to Corel art format.

comp.graphics	 I was recently talking to a possible employer ( mine! :-) ) and he made a reference to a 48-bit graphics computer/image processing system. I seem to remember it being called IMAGE or something akin to that. Anyway, he claimed it had 48-bit color + a 12-bit alpha channel. That's 60 bits of info--what could that possibly be for? Specifically the 48-bit color? That's 280 trillion colors, many more than the human eye can resolve. Is this an anti-aliasing thing? Or is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor.

comp.graphics	 Sorry for wasting your time with a probably simple question, but I'm not an computer graphic expert. I want to read TIFF-Files with a PASCAL-program. The problem is, that the files I want to read are in compressed form ( code 1, e.g. Huffman ). All books & articles I found describe only the plain (uncompressed) format. I don't know where to get the original TIFF specification, furthermore I haven't any access to a realy complete library. Can anybody direct me to a good book or (even better) to an specification available via ftp ? 
comp.graphics	 Yeah, Corel Draw and WordPerfect Presentations pretty limited here, too. Since there's no (not really) such thing as a decent raster to vector conversion program, this "tracing" technique is about it. Simple stuff, like b&w logos, etc. do pretty well, while more complicated stuff goes haywire. I suspect (even though I don't write code) that a good bitmapped to vector conversion program would probably be as big as most of these application softwares we're using -- but even so, how come one hasn't been written? (to my knowledge). I mean, even Hijaak, one of the commercial industry standards of file conversion, hasn't attempted it yet.

comp.graphics	 For better worse, the source on this on is Michael Barnsley. His article in The Science of Fractal Images (Peitgen et al) is a fair-to-middling intro.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I am having something very unusual happen. First some background on my system. I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive, and am running Smartdrv (the version that comes with Windows 3.1) on it. I rarely use Windows. I use a program called Disk Technician Gold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive. It works by having a device driver detect whenever more than one read is necessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it, and minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting. My hard drive is notorious for bad sectors. I usually end up with 8 new bad sectors a week. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 It seems that a particular program designed for blind people is more important than trying to interface windows with a way for blind people to use it.

I don't know what the original purpose of interfacing windows was for the person who posted the question though. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I've been running Dos 6 for about a month. I was generally impressed with the improvements: the multiple boot configurations were great, the new commands were nice, and DoubleSpace worked fine (twice as slow for large data transfers, twice as fast for small with SmartDrv).

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I believe you have the correct files. I think what you'll have to do is go back into Setup and choose change video adapter or whatever it is called. Then the trick is choose the same adaptor you currently have. What Setup does is it actually changes the file WIN.COM whenever you go into it and change the video hardware selection. It incorporates the contents of VGALOGO.RLE into WIN.COM when you do this. This trick can also be used to change the startup logo into whatever you want it to be.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I found the MS defrag looks very much like Norton Speedisk. Is it just a strip-down version of the later? 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Are you using Windows 3.0 or 3.1? If you're still on 3.0, 3.1 devotes about twice as much memory to these and runs out much less frequently. If 3.1, you might use one of the resource monitors (such as the one that comes with the Windows 3.1 Resource Kit or one of the many shareware ones available) to see which programs are hogging the resources (every icon, internal graphics brush, etc. in every program running uses a certain amount of this limited memory area. Also, some don't give it back when they're finished). 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 On ftp.cica.indiana.edu in pub/pc/win3/misc/winadv.zip is a writeup by Steve Gibson of InfoWorld with winbench 3.11 and a number of other benchmark results for nine isa and four VLB video cards. This is a very current upload and is likely to have any card you're currently giving serious consideration. Not in XLS format. Latest version of WinBench that I know of is ver 3.11. I believe they try to maintain the same rating scale between versions, and new versions are released to defeat the lastest coding tricks put in by driver programmers to beat the benchmarks. Don't know on the last one.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Nathan, Win31 has a fixed limit of 64K GDI memory, regardless of physical RAM installed, this is twice that of Win30, but not nearly robust enough for many developers and power users. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Not true! Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality at any size. It all depends on the font's maker and the complexity of the glyphs related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed. Probably the reason for your opinion/experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the market today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font vendor or end-users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being hand-hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language. At best these converted TT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Don't bother if you have CPBackup or Fastback. They all offer options not available in the stripped-down MS version (FROM CPS!). Examples - no proprietary format (to save space), probably no direct DMA access, and no tape drive! 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 This list appears to imply, that MS-windows that has a cost listed above at $70, comes with a C compiler, C++ and Fortran. It does not, of course. These are expensive add-ons that drive the price WAY beyond $70. ( I don't know if the same applies to OS/2 ) 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I think the purpose the original poster was trying to serve is to avoid the SIGNIFICANT amount of disk access that Windows does on startup. It's like it's trying to it's bit in wearing the damn drive out. I estimate it's only reading a Mb of programs & data, but from the performance the drive gives, it sounds like they are scattered all over the drive (my drive is however regularily compressed). What is it that takes so much fuss. Perhaps if MS would take the trouble to optimize this startup process, less people would be wanting to find a solution themselves.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Just as the title suggest, is it okay to do that? I havne't got DOS6 yet, but I heart DoubleSpace is less tight than stacker 3.0. What are disadvantage/advantages by doing that? 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Yes - ignore the manual. Just insert the evelope - don't use the keypad to move it up. The Windows driver sends a message to the printer that tells it to load the envelope - if it is already loaded, it gets ejected and the printer tries to load another. The instructions in the manual are for dumb DOS apps. that don't send the "load envelople" message. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Be very careful with these results! As I recall, numbers from Winbench 2.5 are calculated differently from 3.1, and so these figures are not comparable. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 And why they are considering using WinBench as a test, they may want to read everything Steve Gibson has said on the subject in his InfoWorld column the past couple of month. In short, virtually every board manufacturer cheats on the test by writing things in the driver that is there only to make the board appear faster on the WinBench suite. So the WinBench score has no bearing in reality to how cards stack up on real world tasks. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I have one thing to say-- why does everyone say that spliting them up is such a bad thing? I actually like my program launcher and file manager do be seperate.. it make things easier to figure out.. I mean, take a look at OS/2's wps... (no flames!).. I personally hate it cause I just have too much trouble figuring out how to do simple things like file copy.. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Ok, so if everyone is cheating.. is there any tests that run some macro (to load a huge drawing, etc...) on the SAME machine that might then tell us what the REAL world results are? 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 There you go. COM1 and COM3 use the same IRQ, therefore you can't use a mouse on COM3 and a modem on COM1, or vice versa. It's a limitation of DOS. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I contacted Lotus about this problem today. It has been reported previously and there is a fix. Apparantly the problem only occurs when TAB characters are used immediately preceding the equation frame. The work around when equations are expected to touch the right margin is to delete at least one preceding TAB and use SPACE to align the frame (or use set frame where placed w/no text wrap around). Unforutnately, once the page run-on has occured you are hosed. So the moral of the story is use only SPACE characters to align equation frames. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Has anyone used a Hercules Graphite adapter? It looks good on paper, and Steve Gibson gave it a very good review in Infoworld. I'd love to get a real-world impression, though -- how is the speed? Drivers? Support? 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Yes, both dblspaced and non-dblspaced drives can be defragmented. I believe they use Norton's Speedisk. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I don't believe IRQ5 is the problem. I tried a mouse on COM3, IRQ4 (the usual place) and it still did not like it. Simply, Windows seems to only support mice on COM1 or COM2. The funny part is, though, that Microsoft's own mouse driver (8.xx) was quite happy with my mouse sitting on COM3. Why can't Windows use the mouse driver, or at least support COM3? :-) 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 We have a LAN where we are doing development on product for multiple platforms. For the moment we are only working on MAC and DOS/Windows. The department has always used sneaker net to transport files to the MAC, since it requires a filter to strip out the <LF characters. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 As a beginer, I just wonder how to transfer files from the Sun system (which is on the network) to my PC at home (not connected to the network). I tried to use 'COMit' to do so, but it was very slow and it seemed that getting multiple files at the same time was impossible. Could anybody give me some hints & infomation?

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Does anyone out there have any info on the up and coming fall comdex '93? I was asked by one of my peers to get any info that might be available. Or, could anyone point me in the right direction? Any help would be appreciated. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Thanks for the info. I assume that this is for MFC 1.0. Does anyone know if this will work with MFC 2.0, or what else needs to be done? Thanks. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Help! I am working on a project that involves using text with foreign language characters (in this case Norwegian). I have been manipulating the data with Excell 4.0 and then exporting the data as comma seperated variable files to an RS6000 workstation. The Norwegian characters show up fine under Windows, but appear as "funny" characters on the workstation. The workstation is setup for national language support and we have problem entering the Norwegian characters from the workstation keyboard. On further investigation I found that the character codes used by Windows are different (for these characters) than those specified by the MSDOS code page. The MSDOS codes seem to be the same as the workstation. What gives, and how can get around it. Please reply by E-mail as I will be out of the office the next few days and will not be reading the news. Thanks. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I'm using an OAK based VGA card on my computer (640x480x256). I've downloaded the driver from ftp.cica.indiana.edu and I've had good luck with it. However, does anyone know if a faster driver is available for this card? 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Hello, I'm having problems printing SPANISH characters with WFW2. I was using the Celtic True type which has the accented characters, and used insert symbol to put in in the document. However, when I put it in the doc, I get a big square character, and then it prints out just the same (to my dismay, thinking that was just the way it worked). Can anyone tell me if and how they have printed Spanish characters? I know WP 5.1 has this built-in, but I do not recall ever seeing this option on WFW2. HELP!

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 ahh, yes, this is a fun topic. No, once the name is incribed on the disk, that is it, it is encoded. Not even a HEX editor will find it. You can write over the "Licensed to:", but you can't change the name underneth it. I think if you wish to change this you would have to be a pirate, and we're not going to promote that here. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 That's me.... I just downloaded the Windows Ghostscript package(gswin252.zip,gs252ini.zip) from ftp. When I load a PS file it says it cant find font and substitutes a font called Ugly. It is substituting for basic fonts such as Helv, and Cour. I would imagine that these fonts are included in its font library. Is there something I am doing wrong or am missing? These Ugly fonts are not very clear and well defined, as in sharpness, etc, basically they are ugly! Any advice is welcome.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 We are trying to write a program which can read files created by quattro pro 3.0 and above. Would anyone know where to find information regarding the format in which Quattro Pro stores its files. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I think the support droid was malfunctioning and confused the disk space limit with the virtual address space limit. As far as the disk is concerned, you are limited only by the amount of contiguous free space. The limit that causes the message, "Windows will only use ...," is the amount of virtual address space that the Virtual Memory Manager will create, and this is a function of the amount of free memory that you have when Windows starts. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Windows NT is a giant Windows Operating System. Unline Win3.1, it does not run on top of DOS. It is its own OS, with (Billy Gates assures us) true multi-tasking/multithreading, meets DOD security specs, will run win3.1 programs as well as DOS programs, has multi-processor support, and is primarily a Server program. It's overhead is too high for it to be economical for most users. Speaking of overhead, it requires at least a 386 with 16 megs of RAM. It iwll run with 12, but that's like running OS/2 2.0 with 4 megs. And that's just to run it. Also, I have heard that the system files take up 30-50 Megs, and it is recommended that your drive be a half gig! The SKD is distributed on CD-ROM. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 This is in relation to a question concerning changing the registered to: information of MS-Windows... 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Well, someone at Microsoft told you wrong. Windows will use a swap file larger than the recommended size. Last summer I went to a Microsoft Windows 3.1 Technical Workshop and they distributed A LOT of information that the general public might not be aware of. Anyway in the main book they handed out they have a section on "Creating larger than recommended swapfile". I'll quote the information 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 The latest driver release is 59 and can be found at ftp.cica.indiana.edu in the pub/pc/win3/... directory structure as pro59.zip. I checked with ATI's BBS last nite and there were no releases past 59. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I wonder if anyone can tell me whether or not I can create a bitmap of any size? I followed the bitmap creation example in SDK manual and specified a 24x24 bitmap (set the width/height to 24) and supplied a byte string with 72 chars. But I just cannot get the right bitmap image. I changed the width/height to 32x32 and used the same value string (padded with zero byets to make up to the right size) and got the image. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I look at zApp and really liked it. However, I think you should wait for version 2.0 (I think it will be out soon). 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 These drivers (updated) are available directly from Diamond. they will even ship them to you at no charge.(at least they did for me.) 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 When I first setup windows using the self load mode It grabbed about 20 megs of swap file space, my 120 meg HD was nearly empty at that time. I deleted windows for a time and recently reloaded, now my HD is nearly full and windows just took 4 megs. I have read somewhere that the best rule of thumb is have your permanent swap file the same size as your regular RAM size. I have 4 megs of RAM and windows took 4 meg perm swap file. Works very well. In fact with my available HD space, about 20 megs it won't let me make the swap file any bigger. You should change your virtual mem swap file to 8 megs I think that is what you said your RAM was. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Tell him he probably needs to upgrade to a faster video card! My 9600 baud modem was one of the reasons I sought out the Diamond Speedstar 24X. I get about 7 million WinMarks on my 386-25 and it just about keeps up with the modem speed (using procomm plus for windows, too). He should get over 10 million on his machine with the same card. Anything 10+ should yield acceptable speed... 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Perusing through my Windows 3.1 directory, I came across a file called REGLOAD.EXE. I assume this is part of the registration database, but neither my Windows manual, Win Resource Kit, nor PC Mag's description of files in the Windows directory had a reference to it. At least not one that I could find. Does REGEDIT.EXE use it? Or am I way off base? 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I struggled with the margin problem for ages as well, until I finally got hold of the shareware binary editor BEAV133, and dug into NOTEPAD.EXE (there is no SETUP facility to force NOTEPAD to default to 0.0 margins- it's hardwired into code!!!).

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 My suggestion would be to contact Microsoft about the Video4Windows SDK. You would need to call Developer Services at (800)227-4679 extension 11771 from 6:30am to 5:30pm Pacific time.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Chicago from what I have read is projected to run in 4M on 386 and higher. It is definitely aimed at the desktop. It is rumored to offer preemptive multitasking, multithreading but will not offer multiprocessing. Is 32 bit and no reliance on DOS. It is rumored to have an integrated file and program manager. DOS 7 is rumored to be similar to Chicago but without the GUI. Is also a step towards CAIRO (the next generation OS) which is rumored to be object oriented. I wonder where Windows 4.0 fits here is it a stepping stone to Chicago? Hope this helps. Thx Dave L 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 How does Chicago differ from the (sort of) announced Windows 4. My understand- ing, at least from the InbfoWorld accound of Windows 4 is that it's sort of NT Lite--a full-fledged operating system but lacking server and security features that make NT such a bear. Is W4 not true multithreading?

I just finished changing the registration information using Norton Utilities. I sent the original requester the hex offset into USER.EXE containing the information, and his reply indicated he got several similar answers. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Just a thought on resources, It is very important if you do use a multiplatform toolkit to check on how it uses resources. I have used Glockenspeil commonview under Motif and OS2. I wrote a resource converter from OS2 to Motif, but it really wasn't too easy, especially the naming scheme. In Motif you cannot rename controls/widgets. With windows you can call the OK button ID_OK in every instance, this doesn't work for Motif, you'd have to call it Dialog1_OK, and Motif expects a text string rather than a number. So your constructor should know how to convert a #define into the proper resource identifier. I'd check on how the toolkit expects names, and that if it does use resources, that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to port to. ( By the way, I would never use CommonView or Glockenspiel for anything ) 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 But the impressive performance of the Graphite was not its Winmark, it was its Wintach result (esp. the paint performance). Judging from the Wintach tests, I can hardly imagine that there is a cheat driver for it. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 As a followup, this is a co-worker's machine. He has the latest 2.03 drivers. It only happens using the 1024x768x256 driver. Sometimes it takes a minute or so for the cursor to wig out, but it eventually does in this mode. I susect something is stepping on memory the video card wants. I excluded a000-c7ff in the EMM386 line and in system.ini The problem persisted. Perhaps it is something specific to the Gateway machine or it's components. It is a 66mhz DX/2 Eisa bus with an Ultrastore (24xx?) controller. Ah well, I was hoping this was some kind of 'known problem' or somebody had seen it before. Perhaps a call to Gateway is in order, but I do find folks here usually are far more in the know. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 What is Win32? I upgraded to Mathcad 4.0 and it installed a directory for Win32 under windowssystem . During the upgrade it told me that win32 was required. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 You have a lot more problems keeping up with hardware interrupts in Windows than in DOS - regardless of what communication software you are using. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Correction: All Billy is promising is that it will run 'most' Windows 3.1 programs and the 'major' DOS programs. Do not expect everything you have to run under NT unless all you have are current MS apps. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 What files do I need to download for GhostScript 2.5.2? I have never used GhostScript before, so I don't have any files for it. What I *do* have is gs252win.zip, which I downloaded from Cica. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work on it's own, but needs some more files that I don't have. I want to run GhostScript both in Windows 3.1 and in MS-DOS on a 386 PC (I understand there's versions for both environments). What are all the files I need to download and where can I get them? Any info would be appeciated. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 As the subjects says, Windows 3.1 keeps crashing (givinh me GPF) on me of late. It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every day. The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I can't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same application. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application that caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I need to re-boot. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 The value of these workshops aside, you ought to be able to buy full copies of all this software through your campus bookstore or software distributor at these rates. I'm not aware that the educational version of Word or Excel is doped down in any way. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 One of the rules for a permanent swap file is that it must be contiguous (non-fragmented) space. I suspect that is more responsible for the difference than the amount of free disk, in your case.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Our student association runs a small Novell network which has a subnetwork of Windows for Workgroups and Microsoft Mail. The Director of Finance, en electrical engineering student, would like to gateway this system, either via SLIP or not, into the University's network and thus the Internet, at the very least to exchange e-mail, but possibly also to do ftp's etc. For now, this would be done via a 9600 bps modem. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Somewhere in this thread, it has been said that Windows NT (tm) is a multi-user OS, as well as multi-threading, etc. I certainly haven't seen this to be the case. There are seperate accounts for each person, and even seperate directories if that is desired. I don't see an implentation of simultaneuos use though. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Have you tried setting FILES in your config.sys file to a fairly high number? (I've got mine set to 100; I've seen numbers from 40 to 100 recommended). Also check your STACKS statement, STACKS=9,256 is a good starting point. Try increasing it if it's already set there (such as to STACKS=12,256, etc.). Both STACKS and FILES have been identified as _one_ cause of frequent Win3.1 crashes. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I haven't seen this particular problem, but another place you might check is if your BIOS is doing video shadowing--Diamond wants that turned off. That might cause a memory conflict as well. Good luck. Hope this helps, Chris Loschen, Brandeis U. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Can anyone tell me how Chicago/Windows 4 would differ from OS/2 2.x? Believe it or not, I'm not trying to start a flame war, here. I'm simply curious if there is going to be any feature advantage in either of these products (I do not consider the fact that it has uncle bills seal of approval much of a feature...) 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Does anybody have any idea where I could find a program that can convert a .GIF image into a .BMP image suitable for a Windows wallpaper (i.e. 256 colors). Hopefully there's something out there I can get from an ftp site somewhere...

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Just an apology in advance for posting a binary to this newsgroup. I've had several attempts to mail it to the original poster but it's not getting through intact. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 While there are too many PS clones to count, some of which are quite poor, trying to clone something that goes through regular modifications does require some patience. Three questions come to mid real quick for something like this. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I can vouch for this one. I ordered it and got it for $34 including S&H. It took me awhile to figure out how to get it working with my system, but since I did, I get terrific results while downloading using PCPlus for Windows. I used to get errors if I started any other program while downloading at high speed. Not anymore. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Hi, everybody: I guess my subject has said it all. It is getting boring looking at those same old bmp files that came with Windows. So, I am wondering if there is any body has some beautiful bmp file I can share. Or maybe somebody can tell me some ftp site for some bmp files, like some scenery files, some animals files, etc.... I used to have some, unfortunately i delete them all. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I've been told that Panasonic has uploaded some to Compu$erve, but I don't have a CIS account. I just use the Epson FX-80 driver myself, and it comes out very pretty (if very slowly) on my 1080i. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 But a disk compare utility (old versus new) will. And Windows 3.1 is also flexible enough at install time that you can copy all the files onto your hard disk, which greatly speeds things up and makes them less annoying, if you can spare the 7 or so compressed megs. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Sporadically, yes. It seems to flicker, or change shape into snow briefly. Not enough to impair functionality, just call attention to Diamond's professional sloppiness. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I have an IBM and run Windows 3.1. A friend installed Norton Desktop For Windows on top of this. It loads automatically when I type "win", and surely adds to the (already dismally slow) process of starting up. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I just installed a new TrueType font under MS-Windows 3.1 but though all the applications display the font correctly on the screen, quite a few of them fail to print out the document correctly (on a LaserJet 4 - non-PostScript printer). 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 1. Get the friend to uninstall it. 2. Read the manual (though from your post I infer that you are using pirated software.) 3. Go into SYS.INI and change the SHELL= line to read SHELL=PROGMAN.EXE 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 The 5426 has its own set of drivers. You may be using the drivers intended for the 5420 or 5422 by mistake. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Huh??? My copy of win 3.1 came on _permanently_ write-protected diskettes. (No sliding tabs). 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I've got a probelm with printing envelops on my deskjet 550C from Word for Windows. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 One of the items in the group folder (typically called Norton Desktop Applications) is labelled "Norton Desktop Uninstall". Need I say more!

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 This is a common problem with highly complex TrueType fonts. Microsoft admits to a problem with older versions of the PostScript printer driver, but I've found it to be pretty generic. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 so when is PRODIGY going to open the doors for inetgate to accept internet mail eh? 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I am curious: what does the /double_buffer parameter in smartdrv actually do for me? I seem to have less problems in Windows when I leave it out. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 A posting in another news group I read a while ago said that PC-Xview and PC-Xremote allow you to use Xterm. Call NCD @ 503-641-2200 for more info. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I have an 8514/A card, and I am using windows in 1024x768 mode (normal 8514/A font, not small). In the 386 enhanced mode the DOS window font is too small for my 14" monitor. Is there a way to spacify the font size for the DOS window? You'll have to excuse me if there is a trivial answer, since I am fairly new to MS Windows world. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Has anyone used the Number Nine (# 9) Video Graphics adaptor with Windows or Windows NT? What do you think??? 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I am using WFW 2.0c with a Canon BJ10e. The printer driver is that which comes with Windows 3.1. Unfortatunately, I am having a problem with printing page numbers on the bottom of the page. I can print page number on the top of the page, but not on the bottom. Has anybody had a similar problem and/or does anybody have a solution for such a problem. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 The Microsoft Founation classes (afx) that come with C/C++ 7.0 (and Visual C++) are very good, they already have a version for NT, it comes with source code, and is very close to the navtive API. It also as some classes to manage data structures... 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 hi, Have you used Mac system 6.x or 7.x? If the answer is positive, you would know if ms-windows is a "mature" OS. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 you Need gs252ini.zip and 24*.zip, and 25*.zip font files. You can get these from wuarchive.wustl.edu /mirrors/msdos/postscript. I also advice you to get gs252gui.zip from CICA. It is a nice interface for ghostscript. Ghostscript is very user unfriendly. This interface makes it user friendly. For using this interface you have to get vbrun100.dll (from risc.ua.edu /pub/network/misc) copy this to your windows directory. Copy gui executables and other files to your ghostscript directory. And anter the line below to your autoexec.bat. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 First of all, without wanting to sound nagging and bossy, yes it is a trivial answer and that's perfectly fine ( otherwise how is one supposed to move up to the complicated and challenging questions, we net readers so much enjoy :) ?), and the massive crossposting of your article was not justified... Please refer to appropriate newsgroups next time (by the way c.o.msw.misc is OK :) ). Now as far as your problem is concerned: try playing around with the settings in the 'Fonts..." dialog box under the window control menu (that little square at the top left corner of the window..). 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Dear friend, The RISC means "reduced instruction set computer". The RISC usually has small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase the clock rate to have a high performance. You can read some books about computer architecture for more information about RISC. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Hmmmm, why do I get the feeling that this is gonna start one of those endless threads 'Mac Vs Win" and might even end up as "OS/2 Vs Win". Well, I dont know if Windows is a mature OS, if I have seen one (in which case that has to be X-Windows :) ), but dont be so quick to judge... First of all to try to use plain vanilla Windows is as courageous as to try to use plain vanilla DOS. There are _lots_ of very nice commercial and shareware packages/utilities that will boost up Windows past what MS itself thought possible :)... For example, Norton Desktop for Windows 2.0 (a replace- ment for ProgMan) will give you group-within-a-group capability and will even change group icons, it will launch progs by association (well, FileMan does that too) or by dragging the file in the apps icon (now Mac doesnt do that, huh? :) )... And the list goes on and on... Now, Windows _is_ kinda hard to finetune, boost and configure, but thats trhe price to pay for not paying $$$ to get a Mac or an OS/2 capable machine (an entirely differet story ...)... On the other hand if you dont like the idea of PM's icons not correspnding to the files themselves, well they are not supposed to :).. PM is a Program _Launching_ utility not a file manager... Modify your settings to have FM as your shell and not PM, or get a couple of utilities from cica that supposedly give you a 'Mac feel'... I dont wanna get in the discussion which is a better system: Mac's are good in their own way -- they are _different_ not better or worse than Win PCs-- (actually I am writing this from a Mac lab as a user assistant - so dont think I am partial to Win:) ) By all means check out the stuff in cica (ftp to ftp.cica.indiana.edu under the pub/pc/win3 subdir user: anonymous), or wait for StarTrek (Mac's OS on a PC !!! -- the threads we are gonna have then !!! :) )... Just trying to avoid another Mac-Win war... 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I have a 486DX-33 computer with a SoundBlaster 1.0 card. I'm running Microsoft Windows v3.1. I have the SB driver set up properly to play normal sounds (.WAV files, etc.). I want to play midi files through the Media Player that is included with windows. I know I have to set up the patch maps or something in the MIDI-Mapper in the Control Panel. I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT MIDI. (This is to be the way I'll get my feet wet.) 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Hi there, I'm having a bizarre video problem within Windows 3.1. I have a 286 with a GVGA-16 video board. I've been using the standard Windows VGA driver with other similarly configured computers. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 It certainly is multi-user. What I have seen from the March Beta is that it doesn't yet come with the stuff which exploits multi-user features. I remember somebody from MS stating that it doesn't allow two users share one GUI. My interpretation of this was that one user per console but all the networking and RPC based stuff you want.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 As I can recall, you can click on the upper left button of dos window, then choose font to change. Also there is a demo window to show you in advance how the font you choose will affect the size of dos window. Make a try! 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I have (had) several problems with the card. - Applications crashed when moving the mouse (VGA mode). Fixed by removing the line STACKS=0,0 from config.sys. The default value STACKS=9,256 does just fine. - Random white pixels all over the screen when moving the mouse, in a 256 color graphical mode (the hardware cursor modes). Fixed by turning off the hardware scroll ("24xmode scrolloff") before entering the graphics mode. This also fixed the problem of the windowed DOS boxes under windows. With the hardware scroll enabled, applications write garbage outside the window. - The screensavers do not remove the cursor in 256 color modes (hardware cursor). I don't know if this is a windows problem or a driver problem. Clearly there should be two types of cursor removing functions: a remove- for-draw, which can be ignored for hardware cursors and a remove- unconditionally. Do other cards with hardware cursors have the same problem? - The VESA driver does not support the 640x480x16M TrueColor mode. (Universal VESA drivers do not run at all). 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 recommended me to do that (32bit access). If I use EMM386.EXE, after win3.1 startup I have 6689K of memory free, if I leave EMM386.EXE out of my config.sys I have 9935K of memory free, and windows recommends me a swap file of 11769K.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 HI there! I have a few games that I'd like to run under Windows 3.1 and can't get the PIFS adjusted right. For example Wing Commander. In my DOS Prompt, I have more than 620K available for programs. This is enough to run WC. So I build a PIF giving WC a couple of megs of extended memory etc.. and run it. WC prompts: "Loading Wing Commander..." and then a message about "Using extended memory..." etc... and then my screen goes black (just before the opening scene-the orchestra-would have appeared.) 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 hmm... not that I am an authority on RISC ;-) but I clearly remember reading that the instruction set on RISC CPUs is rather large. The difference is in addressing modes - RISC instruction sets are not as orthogonal is CISC.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I've been using MS Access (still available from some stores for $99.00) and I am quite pleased with it. It's relatively easy to learn, very easy to use and somewhat easy to program. I highly recomend it, particularly at $99.00! I have not used Paradox for Windows, but I don't expect it to be $30.00 better than Access (IMHO). 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Can someone out there tell me how to switch Window's screen resolution quickly and easily? I know that I can go back into install to do it, but what I'd really like is to have is the ability to just change a couple of startup or configuration files and have the resolution changed. I already have both video drivers that I need on my system, so that isn't a problem. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Hi All, I'm asking for info on behalf of a friend. Is there, what would be, the best way to copy the output of a monitor on to video tape? Any ideas?

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I am looking for a WIN31 driver (or set) for my Diamond Speedstar 1MB video card. Does anybody know of an archive site that has these? I looked at CICA and it had drivers for the Stealth card and for Generic ET4000 cards but not one specifically for the Speedstar. Is there one? Or has Diamond dropped the Speedstar out of the driver development loop. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Since running any GUI over a network is going to slow it down by a fair amount, I expect Windows NT will be multiuser only in the sense of sharing filesystems. Someone will likely write a telnetd for it so one could run character-based apps, but graphics-based apps will have to be shared by running the executables on the local CPU. This is how things are shaping up everywhere: client-server architectures are taking over from the old cpu-terminal setups. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 The control box of the Window itself (upper left corner of the window, single click, am I being too simplistic?) has a font option. The 8 X 12 is about the biggest one I can use without the characters turning funky. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Windows NT or WNT can also be derived by the next letter in the alphabet of VMS - same as HAL and IBM. You might recall that the chief architect of VMS is also chief designer of WNT. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 As far as I have read WIN NT will be supported on Intel, DEC ALPHA and the MIPS R4000 series of processors only. I do remember though reading a rumour about Sparc support sometime in the future. I am not sure what you mean by running "unix applications". You would have to have SAS for WIN NT (or maybe SAS for WIN16 etc). I have read that MS will anounce avalaibility of WIN NT by end of May 93 (Comdex Spring). Hope this helps. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 There is a way in SYS.INI to turn off RAM parity checking (unfortunately, my good Windows references are at home, but any standard Win reference will tell you how to do it. If not, email back to me.) That weird memory may be producing phony parity errors. Danger is, if you turn checkling off, you run the slight risk of data corruption due to a missed real error.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Couldn't you simply use MIN() as you use SUM() and than subtract it from SUM() ?? 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 If you are interested in a program which is very easy to use, I strongly suggest Approach 2.0. It is extremely easy to use, make reports, etc. I own both it and Paradox, and I almost never use Paradox. If you need to build up a complicated application, then Paradox is the way to go. I have heard horror stories about the Access programming being extremely cryptic. Since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff (work/ home use and you have not used a database before), I recommend Approach. I have found only one small thing which I would like it to do more easily: I have one database where the order in which the records are entered must be different than what is the logical ordering. To permanently reorder (to use the old DBASE III command) the records requires sorting the records appropriately (no problem, since I almost always use them in this order) exporting the database to another database (which can still be an Approach database), and then copying the exported files back to the original filename. This is a small weakness, considering the other items I really like about Approach. It is also a little slower than Paradox (other than the loading, Paradox takes forever and a minute to load). Paradox also takes a lot of memory (both hard disk (around 12MB) and RAM).

Step 2: ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu or plaza.aarnet.edu.au or archive.orst.edu and cd to graphics/gif GET THE INDEX FILE... Now GigaBytes of pictures are waiting to become your desktop... Advice: If you have a slow computer (<486DX w/4MB RAM), make your bg b/w by selecting b/w dither in any of the abovementioned apps.. Hope it helps... 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I think you may be chasing the wrong problem. I don't think it is the function overloading at all-- I do that sort of thing all of the time in BC++ without a hitch. The big problems I have encountered in porting MFC to BC++ is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple of invalid C++ assumptions. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I had this very same problem, and did 'work around' by turning parity checking off, but that only worked while I was in windows, and the parity error would occur immediately after exiting windows, however,the problem turned out to be 3 chip simms vs 9 chip simms. I can't use 3 chip simms in my computer, and when I replaced them, the problem vanished, forever.

It is true that there are fewer instructions, but what is not commonly known is that this causes the size of your executables to swell, so that in some cases performance is similar for larger applications. As a compromise, many RISC processors today are actually a cross between a Reduced Instructions Set, and a Complex one.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I just got a copy of Tobias' Managing Your Money v9.0. I have Quicken 6, and it's wonderful for some things, but MYM seems to have some features that Q6 doesn't. For example, Q6 doesn't seem to be able to handle monthly automatic deductions from a checking account (you know, a monthly payment that gets electronically deducted every month from my checking account). Or is there something that I'm not doing right, and Q6 can actually do that? Anyway, MYM seems to be able to handle monthly deductions. In fact, it can apparently do better than that. That is, you can specify monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, even yearly. Anyway, is anyone aware of a comparitive study of the two programs? Or can someone just give me their own personal impressions? Maybe someone who has used both. Or maybe someone who is familiar with each could give me a capsule review? Anything would be greatly appreciated. If I keep MYM, I have to pay for it, and I don't know whether it's worth doing. If MYM is better than Q6, of course I will keep it. But if Q6 can do everything MYM can do (maybe even better), I won't. Thanks all!

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 If you need just to change the wallpaper, then I've written a short program in VB that does this by using SystemParametersInfo-function. The bad news is that you need VBRUN200.DLL to run it, and the DLL is some 350kb (the program is about 7kb). The order of pictures depends on the system date and the number of BMP-files in the directory, so the picture remains the same if you execute the program multiple times during the same day and the number of BMPs has not changed.

Examples: The PC-Tools Backup (version 7.1) has one line of Cyrillic text in its opening banner, the next to last line.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Hi I have never used MYM so I can not help you with the comparison of the two products. I am, however, a devoted Quicken user, and I can tell you how to set up the weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly transactions. First use the Memorize feature (CTRL-M) to record the recurring transactions. Next, define a transaction group which uses these memorized transactions and specify the frequency that it should be used (i.e. monthly). Quicken will/can not automatically make the transactions for you, but now all you do is recall the group and all of the individual transactions will be entered at once. Additionally if you are using the Bill Minder, it will remind you when each transaction group is due. For example, you could have three transaction groups. One for payments at the beginning of the month, middle of the month, and one for quarterly payments. I hope this helps.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Walther, I'd have a look at the maximum resolution the combination of the video card and screen would have without flickering. I'd only suggest using the color screen if it does 800*600 without flickering. If this is not too small for your tastes at a 14".... Personally I'd prefer the mono-screen as I always have quite a few windows open. If you only run one program at a time or rarely switch maybe the color 'surplus' is worth trading in the smaller size. If you want to develop programs you will always have to check the colors. I used a 14" mono screen (worst of both worlds) and was surprised how the colors looked I choose on a color screen.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Yes, and it's pretty much what they claim. I haven't had time to try all of it. Considering the price, even if you decide you don't like it, it should be saleable over the next 2-3 months for what you have in it (once the price goes up).

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I just purchased The Norton Desktop for windows, and I also have Norton Utilities. When I installed NDW, it wanted to rem out the line that installed EP (EP /ON) and the command to invoke the Image utility. It replaced the Image command with a new image command that invokes the version of Image that came with NDW. This makes sense, as presumably the Image version with NDW is newer than the one with NU. It did not, however, install smartcan in the autoexec. Now two questions: 1: Will NU use the image data saved by the newer version of image invoked. i.e. Are the two version of Image compatable? 2: Will erase protect use the info from smartcan, and vice versa? I use both dos and windows, and I want to make sure that when I erase files in either environment, they are going to be protected.

I came back and all was well except no groups. Program Manager was EMPTY. All the .grp files were in the directory. I had to remake the groups with the new and group selection. ALL THE ICONS AND FILES INSIDE THE GROUPS WERE STILL THERE AND WORKING FINE. Just the groups had gone out of program manager. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I have used both version 1.17 drivers for Win 3.1 and the new 2.03 drivers. I have had none of these problems. No GPF's at all. I have a feeling that your problems are not with the card or drivers. The ATI Ultra drivers are considered some of the most reliable on the market, and the SS 24X ones seem quite good as well. Maybe you should check BIOS problems in your Gateway. I know a few people with Gateway DX2's, and all of them have found some problem or other with compatibility -- especially with graphics.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I'm looking for a decent Windows news reader. I've given up on winvn 0.76 since it doesn't work very well with the winsock.dll of the IBM TCP/IP for DOS 2.1. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 No. When the program is run, it loads 4 configuration files; autoexec.bat, config.sys, win.ini, and system.ini. There is no Open entry on the File menu. You can only edit these four files. If you need to edit some other program's .ini file, use Notepad or some other ASCII editor.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I am getting Garbled output when serial printing thru Windows & works etc. This has occurred on several systems and goes if a LaserJet 4 is used. I suspect that there is no need for handshaking in this case due to the capacity (memory/speed) of it. There is no problem printing from DOS. Are there any obvious tweaks I'm missing. I'm sure its not JUST me with this problem. Thanks for reading.... John Atherton 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 To clarify a little more: SOUND.EXE is a self-expanding archive which contains the driver (which is actually called SPEAKER.DRV, I think).

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 One difference will _probably_ be the same difference as between OS2 and Windows 3.x now--one will likely have a lot of software available for it and one won't (emulation, with the inevitable incompatibilities that crop up in spite of all the contrary claims, just doesn't count when you _have_ to use a certain software package that doesn't quite run properly under the emulation...). Developers want to channel their resources toward a platform that has a large installed base, and in a case like that the platform that is most successfully _marketed_ (regardless of its relative sophistication) will win.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I have just noticed my FileManager doing something strange recently. Usually, the line at the bottom of the FileManager (the status bar, I guess) displays the total disk space and the total number of bytes for the current selection. If I select a whole bunch of files, I will get an exact byte count. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I just looked at CICA yesterday and noticed that they didn't have anything, but I seem to remember seeing something at WUARCHIVE in the /mirrors/msdos/windows3 directory. I think I got my 3.1 drivers from America Online though. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Could you please upload to any of the ftp sites (such as ftp.ciaca.indiana.edu) and announce it here? This will benefit people does not have access to their BBS in USA (like me :-))? 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I assume you're using the driver available from cica (hp4-v108.zip). Bring up the setup screen of the printer through control panel. Click on the "Options" button brings up another screen of choices. Change the "Graphics Mode" from "HP-GL/2" to "Raster" and check the box "Print Truetype as graphics (this is only available when you choose "Raster"). Now you should be able to print all your truetype fonts correctly. Good luck.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Hi. My last question for the year. I have a mail-order no-name notebook with 4 meg ram. I never have problems with my huge ramdisk or when running desqview, but Win3.1 and W4W2.0 constantly crash on me, most commonly citing a "memory parity error." The only thing I can do is TURN OFF and re-boot. My CMOS ticks off & counts all the memory every startup, and there is never a problem with this either.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Hi, I am working on gathering data on the way that users use computers. This involves getting subjects to type and use a mouse. I want to be able to watch what they are doing without being in the same room. It would be ideal if I could watch the session on another monitor without the subjects knowledge. I believe that spliting the monitor cable will only work for short distances, ie <5m. I will need to be approx 10m away, as the cable travels. The PC's are connected to a TCPIP network and run Windows 3.1. Is there any software that will allow me to watch what is happening on another PC? Thanks Regards Jon Gough TRUST Project

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 There's a "sound.exe" file that claims to be the driver but I'm suspicious since it's not a .drv file. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Again, I do not speak for Peter Tattam, but it is my understanding that it will shareware status as Trumpet 1.05 for DOS is, and I imagine that the registration fees will be similar. I also believe that a new version of Trumpet for DOS will be released sometime in the near future. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I think you need the EMM386.EXE noems This will let the expanded mem be active but not use any, therefore this will give you more extended mem for windows yet have all the bases covered.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Very simple. You have to have the MOUSE.COM or MOUSE.SYS loaded in DOS before you run Windows. Note that you don't need to have these files loaded to use the mouse in Windows. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 1) make sure your hard drive is defragmented. This will speed up more than just windows BTW. Use something like Norton's or PC Tools. 2) I _think_ that leaving the wall paper out will use less RAM and therefore will speed up your machine but I could very will be wrong on this. There's a good chance you've already done this but if not it may speed things up. good luck Morgan Bullard mb4008@coewl.cen.uiuc.edu or mjbb@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 It sounds like something/one may have set the 1000's separator to "." in Contol Panel (under International). This makes 23,482 look like 23.482 and File Manager is chopping off what it thinks is the decimal part of the file size. 3,356,345 becomes 3.356.345, and again, File Manager is confused by the decimal points where there should be commas, chopping off everything to the right of the first period.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Are there any Workspace Managers out there for Windows 3.1 ? By a Workspace Manager, I mean something like the HP APOLLO Workstations have - multiple workspaces under X. There is a window at the bottom of the screen which allows you to select different workspaces. It overcomes the problem of having stacks of windows open on the one screen. Instead, you can spread them amongst different workspaces which act like independent screens, and you can flick between them. Thanks in advance.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I have a Microsoft Serial Mouse and am using mouse.com 8.00 (was using 8.20 I think, but switched to 8.00 to see if it was any better). Vertical motion is nice and smooth, but horizontal motion is so bad I sometimes can't click on something because my mouse jumps around. I can be moving the mouse to the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly for a bit, then jump to the right, then move smoothly for a bit then jump again (maybe this time to the left about .5 inch!). This is crazy! I have never had so much trouble with a mouse before. Anyone have any solutions?

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 You could use DOS 6 to do this partly. You can set up different config.sys and autoexec.bat commands for each user, and they just have to select their menu option on bootup. Then you can have the autoexec.bat copy the win.ini and system.ini files and change directories for them. When they exit windows, it can copy back generic .ini files if you want.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I have uploaded the most recent Windows drivers for the Cirrus GD5426 chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu (file is 5426dr13.zip). They're very recent, I downloaded them from the Cirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there, email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well. I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them). 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I just bought a BJ-200 printer a couple of days ago. I compared it to the sample print of an HP DeskJet 500 and knew that the HP wasn't for me. The BJ-200 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality. I can compare it with the HP LaserJet IIID PostScript and they look almost identical ( depending on the kind of paper). I don't have problems with the ink not being dry, it seems to dry VERY fast. Probably within a second. Since Canon is giving a $50 rebate until the end of May, it is really a good buy.

I have been using Windows 3.1 since buying it last winter but I have just now come across an annoying bug. I now have about 8 different groups in program manager but it seems that everytime I install something new that makes a new group, it promptly disappears after I turn of windows! This happened when I installed Excel and WinFax Pro v.3. They both created their own groups but when I turned off windows and reran them, they were gone.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I had the same problem. At first, I thought it was the video driver and made sure I had the most current drivers, because the problem was most evident at SVGA resolution modes.

Does anyone know of sites, with Windows compatible pictures, that can be accessed in such a way??? If you do would you please post them. TIA Mark. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I'm not 100% sure, but I think the T800 was a 25MHz transputer? so ya tie a gazillion of them together to get 100mips. (The newest is the T9000 which kicks anyone's butt :)... haven't seen them used much though).

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I am looking for the latest drivers for the Actix graphics accelerator card. The driver I am currently using is version 1.21 and doesn't support more than 256 colors in 1024x768 mode even you have 2MB memory. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 My Problem: I wasn't aware of the fact that I would need an *SCSI*-CD-ROM for Windows NT when ordering the Beta-SDK-Package. So my question: Is there any driver available that will allow me to use my Mitsumi (Non-SCSI) CD-ROM for installation ? If there is one, from which place (ftp-site) can I get it ? 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I have the same card, TVGA-8900c. When I checked, the latest driver for windows 3.1 is dated Aug. 92 in garbo.uwasa.fi in /win31/drivers/video. If you find a better version (updated) please let me know, Thanks.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Has anyone had any experience with a replacement comm driver for windows called TurboComm. I read about it in PCMag Apr 23 1993 and am interested but not willing to shell out the 45 bucks the company wants just to try it out. It supposedly eleminates the problems that occur during a high speed file transfer and a disk access made by another program running at the same time. If anyone has any pro/cons about this product, i would be very inter ested to hear them. Please Email at the address give below. THANKS. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 No, not really. It may be that your winfile.ini has gotten corrupted for some unknown reason. Have you tried re-creating it by either 1.exiting filemanager with the save setting option on when the status bar is visible, or 2.double clicking on the Control menu(the one with minimize and maximize in in) when everything looks proper? 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I would like to change all of the system fonts in windows... I have a program that will generate system fonts from truetype, but i was wondering if there is a problem to help you set up all your system fonts. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I think you can do this with REGEDIT, which can make changes to the OLE registration database. From Program Manager (or File Manager) choose RUN and type REGEDIT. You do have it- its included with Windows, but not well documented. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Are you sure you're running in 386-enhanced mode? (Windows 3.1 takes more memory...)

PROBLEM enters. The DARN serial ports have no selection for COM settings, they are stuck on 3 and 4. Good card for HD's and FD's but lousy for serial.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 ok, i have a 486dx50(ISA) w/ Diamond Stealth VRAM 1MB. I was really satisfied w/ its performance in windows. but now more and more games needs higher frame rates in DOS' VGA, especially this new Strike Commander. ;-) this stealth vram can only give me 17.5 fps. ;-( (i use 3dbench). my winmark was 6.35 million, i think. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Stacker achieves better compression ratio than DOS6, yet the latter comes with virus detection, memory manager, and multiple booting. Each of them are not so good as the NAV, QEMM or NDOS in my opinion, but with a package of only $45, it's nice if haven't yet installed all of those stuffs.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Is anyone out there running a MS-DOS system with a LocalTalk board? I am on an Appletalk network, hooked up with a DayStar Digital LT200 MC LocalTalk Interface Board, running on a PS/2 Model 70. I'm using the AppleShare PC software for file server and network access. It works fine under DOS or the Window or OS/2 DOS box. But when I try to load it *before* Windows, so that every application I run could get access to it, the machine crashes hard as soon as I start up an application. And of course, things look pretty hopeless for OS/2 (but who knows).

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Mornin' all. I was wonderin'..... I got screenpeace (the screensaver, which I think is *very* good), and I got a problem with it... There is an option there, "realize colour table", and if it's switched on, some wallpapers' colours will get *ucked up with some screensavers (e.g. the "flashlight" one). If I turn it off, however, it works well, and it's faster, so I have it off. All's nice and well. However, If I turn it off, then it will be on again next time I start windows. All the setting are set in the win.ini file, and I *do* have "save settings on exit" selected. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Do you mean the icons _of_ the program groups, or the icons of the individual programs _in_ the program groups? I assume you mean the latter, and the answer is: sure you can. Just click once (not double) on the application icon, then Alt-F P (File | Properties). Click on the Change Icon box and tell it the icon filename. Or use the Browse sub-selection. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Word for Windows lets me designate text as being in a language other than US English. (Alt-F L, Format | Language, as I recall.) So I mark it for English (UK), but it still accepts "rumor" and squawks at "rumour". As far as I can see, Microsoft didn't include the English (UK) dictionary on my disks. (I don't mean to imply that I was singled out; I assume that nobody in the U.S got them.) I dialed the Microsoft BBS, but nothing in the Word for Windows section looked helpful. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I think I have the same problem. I think it is caused by the rubber ball in the mouse, which doesn't roll so smooth. The detectors in the mouse notice this and whoops, I hit a mine (using minesweeper :-) ).

Is only in Windows. I have replaced card and am waiting on latest drivers. Also have experienced General Protection Fault Errors in WSPDPSF.DRV on Winword Tools Option menu and in WINFAX setup. I had a ATI Ultra but was getting Genral Protection Fault errors in an SPSS application. These card manufactures must have terrible quality control to let products on the market with so many bugs. What a hassle. Running on Gateway 2000 DX2/50. Thx Dave L 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 It is correct that VC++ is NOT considered an upgrade for C7. C7 is basically a DOS product, VC++ is a Windows product. As Windows is not an upgrade for DOS, it is a separate operating system product line, its utilities cannot be upgrades for DOS utilities. However, I have also been told that it is NOT an upgrade for QCWIN, which it should be!

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Hi, I am using a dtk 386-20Mhz 13Meg memory to run a variety of programs, and have had problems off and on with lock up, but now I am trying to run an application that wants a lot of memory over a period of time (Playmation 24 bit rendered) and it is locking up Everytime. I have an ATI ultra + w/2Meg which I have tried in each of the video modes, I have excluded the region of video memory from A000-C800 segments from the use of emm386, have tried adjusting the swap partion from large to nonexistant (to prevent swapping) and I have REM'd ALL TSR's and utilities in config.syus and autoexec, and even tried using the default program manager, disabling my HP dashboard. even with a minimal system, no swap, no smartdrv, no TSR's, no windows utilities and exclusion of video regions it still locks up completely (no mouse control, no response to anything except 3finger salute, and even that does not stop by the standard windows screen, but simply does a full reset immediately). Just about out of ideas, anyone out there have any???? Thanks tom branham branham@binah.cc.brandeis.edu 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 For a VGA card these are the correct files but you can't just copy them back and expect it to work. You have to create a new WIN.COM file. Try the command (you will have to worry about what directories each file is in since I don't know your setup):

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Somewhere (ftp.cica.indiana.edu or SIMTEL20 mirror) there is a program called winlogo.zip that does the trick. It works great. I believe the reason why you can't change the files you mentioned is that the logo is actually imbeded into the windows executable (Somebody please correct/expand on this)

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I really appreciate this information. However, given that I don't have direct Internet access - which means I don't have Archie access - I must resort to using FTPMAIL. This means that I need the site name and the directory where these workspace managers are located.

This is good to do every so often, even if you have a mouse pad. Dust still gets caught in the mouse and on the rubber ball. As well, lint and other garbage may find it's way onto the rubber ball and get into the mouse damaging the horizontal and vertical sensors.

The first time I try to run Ami Pro after loading windows, it loads, but causes (I think it was a) segmentation fault in AMIPRO.EXE right before it finishes, with all times after that only managing to get to the logo box that first pops up when it begins loading, and then causes a general protection fault in module AMIPROUI.DLL at 0002:1147. I have not been able to fix this problem except by reinstalling Ami Pro. This has happened twice, with both times being after having ran compress on my hard drive. BTW, I am not running stacker or any other disk compression programs, and if you don't already know, PCTools compress is actually a defragger, despite it's name.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Can't guarantee that it'll work for everyone, but I finally fixed my mouse jumpiness problems: I installed a bus mouse. (Sorry, I didn't say the solution was free.) In the past I'd tried everything with my Microsoft serial mouse. (Cleaning it, unloading all kinds of TSRs, turning off SMARTDRV write cacheing, changing COM ports, ...) Nothing worked. Yesterday I finally broke down and bought a Mouse Systems Bus Mouse. The improvement is even better than I had imagined! So much so that my old mouse must have been jumpy all the time (I just thought it was jumpy sometimes), and I had gotten so used to it I didn't notice.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I recently purchased a Diamond Stealth 24 Video card and received the wrong drivers. Does anyone know where I can ftp the windows video drivers for the Stealth 24. I tried the drivers at cica and they don't work. The right drivers are on the Diamond BBS but the file is almost 1 meg and it would take a while to download them at 2400 baud. Any information would be appreciated. Please contact me at doug@sun.sws.uiuc.edu

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I once had this problem. All I did was to copy the whole doc to a new file. The problem was gone. Hope this helps.

comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 DOS 5.0/6.0 cannot read the NTFS file system, although the NTFS file system can read the FAT file system of DOS. I have WindowsNT on a seperate partition on my machine at home, and I can read my DOS disks from Windows NT, but not vice-versa. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I bought a Viewsonic 17 for use at home but after a week I took it back. I felt for the money my NEC 5FG that I use at work was a much better monitor. The NEC is sharper, flatter, less distorted, and more stable. I have heard complaints from people about the NEC FG series having some quality control problems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 This is the official Request for Discussion (RFD) for the creation of two new newsgroups for Microsoft Windows NT. This is a second RFD, replacing the one originally posted in January '93 (and never taken to a vote). The proposed groups are described below: 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 I am starting to work on a project using DDE to transfer data. The application came with an Excel macro which can transfer the data. I need to 'port' it to 1-2-3W. 1-2-3W uses a very different setup for DDE macros. 
comp.os.ms-windows.misc	 Does anyone know a program that will record keyboard sequences that I do in a windowed dos box? I would like to have something that starts a telnet program and then logs me into my accounts. Windows Recorder doesn't seem to be able to record the key sequences.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 You realize, of course, that inevitably some anal retentive moron is going to come along and wag his fingers and his jowls in outrage that personal politics are more important than [SMCAP][BOLD][Font:God 999pt.]The Law[smcap][bold][font]. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 A program in the archive keymap00.zip on simtel and mirror sites in the msdos/keyboard directory will do this. It is written in assembler and it best if you have a compiler to create a new keyboard map. It is possible, however, to use a binary editor to edit the provided compiled keyboard driver if you do not have a compiler. I used hexed100.zip, also available on simtel. Simply serach for the codes 00 01 02 03 to locate the biginning of the "normal" keyboard map. Then swap the codes for the keys that you wish to swap. See the keyboard directory of simtel for programs that report the scancode for each key to you (some bios programs also have this info). Good luck, 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I need a device (either an ISA board or a subsystem) which will take two RGB video signals and combine them according to a template. The template can be as simple as a rectangular window with signal one being used for the interior and signal two for the exterior. But I beleive fancier harware may also exist which I do not want to exclude from my search. I know this sort of hardware exists for NTSC, etc. but I need it for RGB. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Well, my 14inch VGA 1024x758-interlacing 2.5 year old no brand monitor just bit the bullet. I pressed the power switch and a few seconds later, the power light went out with a POP. Gawd, it's only been two and half years. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 It is model number #7033D, a 14" interlaced .28dp. BTW, if you have a number to contact the company, that would really be helpful to. Thanks for replying. I was beginning to believe that I was never going to get a reply. I posted this on the netnews bboard because the first message I sent to you was returned, and I didn't know if my second message would get to you. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I remember reading somewhere (QEMM manual, I think) that STACK=9,256 is needed only for the Windows SETUP program. Otherwise, use STACK=0,0. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I was wondering if anyone out there has had the same problem I am having with my Gateway 2000 486-33DX VL-Bus system with ATI Graphics Ultra Pro LB. When I have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600, everything is fine, but whenever I use it in 800x600 (Windows, AutoCAD, GIFs) the screen gets about 1 1/2 inches shorter. At the very top and very bottom of the screen there is about a 3/4" bar of black. The screen isn't cut off, it just squeezes everything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio. While I can manually change the V-Size on the back, this is a pain in the ass, and it just shouldn't happen anyway. I've called Gateway numerous times and they haven't been able to help me at all. Two different times they sent me a new card, and both times the new card didn't work at all in my computer. They even tried to bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple of days, when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks before billing my card. But their customer support is a different story... So, if anyone has had this same problem, please let me know if you know what to do. Hell, let me know if you don't have a solution, just so I know I'm not the only one with this problem. Thanks in advance. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Yes, You bought the WRONG SIMMS.....You need 1X36 or 4X36, which are 72 pin SIMMS.....These are better anyway becuase the send/receive data in 4byte (32bit+4bit parity, one for each byte) Chunks. You will undoubtedly see these SIMMS becoming more widely used in the near future. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I am just about to post the results of my big computer purchase. One of the key points was the ability to use my American Express card. I read the fine print between double warranty policies of Amex and Citibank VISA. Sure, both will allow you double warranty on computers, but Citibank has a maximum claim of $250.00. Could you imagine trying to get your monitor or mother board fixed for $250.00? Amex has NO limit on claims. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Since I've been seeing all kinds of complaints regarding Gateways lately on here, I thought I post my recent pleasant experiences. My machine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY from when I called the order in. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Where can I get the Winmarks benchmark to run on my PC? via ftp would be best. -Roger 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Maybe its a monitor problem. You mentioned that you swapped cards, but not monitors. Perhaps that could be it. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I have 1 4Mx9 70ns 36pin SIMM for Sale. It is in perfect condition. It will not work in my system because it requires 72 pin SIMMS. I would like to get what I paid for it. $115 + 3 for insured shipping. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Phone support is quick and competent from many mail order firms, but not so quick and not so competent from others (Gateway included). But my experience with computer retailers (which is significant) has lead to the conclusion that sales personnel and retail-technical personnel are forbidden to actually learn about the products they sell. Talk about incompetent! O.K., so a few percent of their answers are correct, but those salesmen don't even realize how stupid they are. ... ....... O.K. ...I'll settle down now.... .... let me catch my breath..... .. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Thanks to all who responded to my original post. I got the number for Western Digital tech support and determined that I need to upgrade the BIOS to the Super BIOS. It will handle hard drives with up to 16 read/ write heads and up to 1024 cylinders. The upgrade is $15, payable by check or money order. Send to: 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I read a recent article in Personal Computer World mainly about the new digit audion formats (DCC and MD) but at the end talked about how nice it would be to use these for data storage with a brief calculation of how much data you could store. The author had been talking to someone from Sony about these formats and mentioned this to get the reply "MD is a purely audio format, we wouldn't use it for data", then when pressed for info about MO the Sony man basically admitted that it was no more than a slight adaptabtion on MD! 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Could someone tell me if the ATI graphic ultra pro is supported in a version of vpic now. If so where is it located. thanks Robert 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Just a quick THANKS to the many who explained the backing up of my masters.

I was surprised to hear that "NO programs on high-density disks have copy protection," which someone back there said. Huh! Learn something new every day!

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 No rumour, IBM's clock tripling chip was seen in some trade show last fall (COMDEX or something, I wasn't there). All you people who are drooling after this chip do realize that it has no FPU, just like 486SX, that Evil Marketing Ploy(tm) from Intel, don't you? It has 16K of internal cache, which probably is where the saved silicon real estate went. Because of some contract, IBM is not allowed to sell its 486 chips to third parties, so these chips are unlikely to become available in any non-IBM machines. Of course, nothing prevents other companies from implementing a DX3/99, but nobody hasn't even come out with a real 486DX (FPU and all) clone yet (although AMD soon will). 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Hi, I have got a Quantum ProDrive 80AT IDE harddisk and would like to format it. When trying to format it (*no* low-level format, just FDISK and DOS FORMAT), I somehow messed up the parameters... I had entered FDISK /MBR not exactly knowing what this does. The suggested drive type 38 formats the drive only to 21MB. I tried type 25, but this gives only around 70MB and not the nominal 80MB. Could I use user type 47? However, I don't know the actual parameters (cylinders, heads,...) Could someone give me them? And how does FDISK work together with user type 47?

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 While others here may have had better experiences, I, too, share the sentiments posted above. Though I have the original Stealth/VRAM, it is only "relatively" recent that the Windows drivers for this card have evolved to a point of decent performance. Note that there are STILL a couple of modes I cannot use (ie. will not) due to shadowing, mis-drawn check boxes, etc. I believe the version I have is 2.01. If there's a more recent release, I'd appreciate if someone would drop me a note to let me know -- I haven't been able to get on their BBS lately to check again. Naturally, Diamond doesn't even bother notifying me of fixes/releases. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 This may be the dumbest question of the year, but is there a way to 'piggyback' or expand a 6-slot motherboard (all 16-bit) to get the usual 8? My case has slots for 8, and I'd like to get a scanner, but with all my other cards I'm already max'd out! I'm hoping that a simple solution exists, e.g. an adapter that turns one slot into three. I don't mind if it turns it into 8-bit slots, as I can put my I/O card, MIDI card, and Soundblaster card there. My other cards are 16 bit (IDE/Floppy, SVGA, modem). 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 If your Gateway is equipped with a Western hard drive, then the noise is probably coming from there and not from the fan. The Western drives are notoriously noisy.

I can boot from drive A: (which disk drive does not matter) but if I remove the disk from drive A and press the reset switch, the LED of drive A: continues to glow, and the hard disk is not accessed at all.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Your machine will run at whatever the bus is jumpered to/CMOS is set to (usually wait states) regardless of what speed RAM is installed. No motherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed, unless you call failing as a sort of auto-sense. This is how you can sometimes use "slower" RAM in a machine. You either set the number of wait states to accomodate the slow RAM (in which case, all memory will run at that slower rate) or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the slower RAM will act like faster RAM and you won't crash. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Does it do it to all tapes? Were the two tapes that it unwound of the same type from the same batch? The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and had closed the little marker hole. It was only on a few tapes of a set. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I saw in this months PC or PC World an ad for computers using IBM's 486SLC. So I don't think IBM is restricted in selling their chips, at least not anymore. A clock-tripled 486, even without coprocessor would be great, especially with 16k on-board cache. Make it 386 pin-compatible, and you have the chip upgrade that dreams are made of :-)

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I'm posting this for a friend that runs a BBS. I'm not sure if its under DOS or Windows. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 The problem is with ISA bus-masters which can only address the first 16MBs of system memory. Bus-masters do not use the CPU nor the system DMA to do the actual data transfer but transfer their data directly to the system RAM.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 You are making the same mistake I did: you are confusing the DRIVE interface to the DATA THROUGHPUT interface. Again from my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}: Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM. Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM. Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}. Main problem: there are a lot of external devices which are internal terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the end. Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. SCSI-1: 7 devices per SCSI controller. 8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave} and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base. 16-bit SCSI-1 requires a SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2 which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode. SCSI-2 is fully SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be very expendsive} and software. Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}. SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.

For the XGA-2, get what you like. I prefer multi- syncs like the IBM 6319, the NECs or even a fixed frequency monitor like my home Viewsonic 6. I like the Multisyncs because it's easy to run them in modes like 800x600x64k colors noninterlaced, or at higher modes like 1360x1024x16. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Some motherboards support VL bus and 50-DX CPU. There is an option (BIOS I think) where additional wait(s) can be added with regard to CPU/VL bus transactions. This slows the CPU down to a rate that gives the VL bus device(s) time to 'do their thing'. These particular wait(s) are applied when the CPU transacts with VL bus device(s). You want to enable these wait(s) only if you are using a 50-DX with VL bus devices.

The expected time for operation will jump from 3 to 6 minutes. I try to use some of the harddisk tools to check if there is any physical damage to my harddisk and report always turn out to be none.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I have the same question as Guido. It is possible to use the ESDI drive as a master and the IDE drive as the slave ? At the moment , I have been using the ESDI drive and recently I bought a IDE drive to use as the 2nd drive . The person in the computer shop told me that it is not possible to run 2 disk controller cards together on the same motherboard ( ESDI AND IDE ) but I think there might be some way of making them work. Can anybody enlighten me on this? And it is possible to run a ESDI HDD using a IDE controller? or vice versa? Can anybody please help me out on this? Your help will be very much appreciated.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 It depends on what you'd like your joystick for. I've seen Gravis joysticks at Radio Shack. They seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my hand. I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than a year) on flightsims. One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability to adjust the tension of the stick. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Oh yeah, I just read in another newsgroup that the T560i uses a high quality Trinitron tube than is in most monitors.(the Sony 1604S for example) and this is where the extra cost comes from. It is also where the high bandwidth comes from, and the fantastic image, and the large image size, etc, etc... 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I believe so, since the Buslogic cards have proven to be very reliable in OS/2 2.0....

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I recently purchased the then current Pkg.# 486dx-33 for $2395 (but changed to NEC 3FGx monitor upgrade). Buy this Pkg. #3 now - for $100 more, you now get a bigger HD - 340mb with @256 HD cache. 30 days ago, when I bought this pkg., it was 245mb with @132K HD cache. This is a great deal although it is generally recommended you at least upgrade to the 15' Zeos (CTX) monitor for $99 more I believe. Whether you also upgrade to the Diamond Viper video card is your choice. I stayed with the Diamond Speedstar Pro. Zeos Tech Support is really good - call after normal business hours to get the fastest access. The hardest part about buying a Zeos is the wait till it is delivered - once you order you can hardly wait to get it! There are quite a few good mail order houses around - lots of bang for buck with Zeos. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 No, you need not bypass the config.sys, in Dos 6.0, there is a function of multi-config, have you tried BOOT.SYS ? the multi-config is the kind that you can choose you config.sys at the startup. And I find that is very good. It has no conflict to QEMM. (I have problem when using BOOT.SYS) The key you say is F8, which is trace the config.sys step by step. Sorry, if any error :)

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I have a 5 1/4" drive as drive A. How can I make the system boot from my 3 1/2" B drive? (Optimally, the computer would be able to boot from either A or B, checking them in order for a bootable disk. But if I have to switch cables around and simply switch the drives so that it can't boot 5 1/4" disks, that's OK. Also, boot_b won't do the trick for me.) 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Oh yeah! I just got my new Eizo Flexscan yesterday (to replace my old 8515), and I tried it with 1360x1024. This mode is just great! I can get four perfectly readable command windows on the screen! And if I need more colors, I can go back to 1024x768 or even 800x600. One thing I am wondering though: Why isn't there a MONxxxx.DGS file which contains ALL the resolutions up to 1360x1024? Now I have to change the XGASETUP.PRO every time I want to switch, instead of simply going through the system settings of OS/2. Regards, Martin Erzberger

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Just wanted to ask a question. I bought a hard disk drive second-hand the other day, and I opened the packaging up and saw that there was a small sticker on the drive that had a little red apple with a bite taken out of it. It's socket did not look the same as my existing hard disk that is in my computer already (it has fifty little pins sticking out from it instead of the 39 that is sticking out of my old hard disk. I don't know if disk drives for the Apple (or Mac) are different from ones used in AT clones, so could someone tell me if I could use this hard disk on my AT clone? If not, what did I just purchase? It's a Quantum Prodrive. It's dated 1988 on the green board. Will I need a controller/add-in card? All the help is much appreciated. Thanks! :) 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I would doubt that you would be able to use the hard drive. XT drives usually came in MFM or RLL flavors. I bet your 386SX has IDE drives. The two are not compatible on the same controller. However, you might be able to use the drive *with its controller* in your 386SX. You should be able to plug your 360K drive into your existing 386SX controller (I think). You might have to use the floppy controller that was used in the XT.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I started a similar thread about a month ago, and got many replies. The summary: 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 First off, with all these huge software packages and files that they produce, IDE may no longer be sufficient for me (510 Mb limit). Second, (rumor is) Microsoft recognizes the the importance of SCSI and will support it soon. I'm just not sure if it's on DOS, Win, or NT. At any rate, the deal is with Corel who makes (I hear) a good cohesive set of SCSI drivers.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Well, not to be picky, but the V in VLB stands for VESA. While the V in VESA stands for video, saying the V in VLB stands for video is not entirely correct. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I've been intently following the MAG thread while waiting for mine to arrive in the mail.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I have been using a NEC 3FGx for several months now. Several others here also have this monitor. We have had no problems. Personally I would spend extra money for this monitor and sacrifice other features on a PC such as 33 MHz viz 50 Mhz. Based on the comments of others you might want to view the 3FGX vs the 4 series on a PC running windows at 1024x768. The refresh rate appears ok for me, but you might feel differently. Finally speaking of spending money, with the size of today's files, etc, a tape backup is certainly worth $200-$300. Recently I set up a friend's PC 50Mhz and VESA local bus. The redraw time for a graphics program was only a factor of 2 faster which I doubt warrants the extra cost. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Good luck finding an MX17S. When I was looking around back in December/January, Mag wasn't producing any because they couldn't get tubes from Sony.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I have some used, but working, parts available for the original IBM laptop - the PC Convertible. If you have one of these things, and still are using it, you may have found out that IBM wants OUTRAGEOUS prices for parts. I built up a supply of enough parts to keep mine going for a few years, and will be willing to part with the rest. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 The above does not tell the proper story of SCSI: SCSI-I: 8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}, synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base. SCSI-1{faster} this requires a SCSI-2 controller chip and provides SCSI-2 {8-bit to 16-bit} speeds with SCSI-1 controlers. SCSI-2: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst{8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst{32-bit/wide and fast}. 16-bit SCSI can be wide or fast, it depends on how the port is designed{The Quadras will support fast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since the Quardas use a SCSI-1 {non-wide} port}.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 If you are talking about laser jet 4 then I believe it has to be postscript. I don't see any advantage to using PCL when you have a peice of hardware plugged into the LJ4 that is doing the work and it can support any language that is suited for the job. Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of handling 1200 dpi specifications. I only have experience with the Laser Master Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript. It also has a fast print mode which is not postscript, and it is at a lower resolution (600dpi I think), but it is FAST!!!! This particular product uses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent PC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation processed PS.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 We had the same issue plague us for months on our Gateway. I finally got tired of it so I permanently interchanged the drives. The only reason I didn't do it in the first place was because I had several bootable 5-1/4's and some 5-1/4 based install disks which expected the A drive. I order all new software (and upgrades) to be 3-1/2 and the number of "stupid" install programs that can't handle an alternate drive are declining with time - the ones I had are now upgraded. And as for the bootable 5-1/4's I just cut 3-1/2 replacements. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I would also like an explanation of this. If anyone can explain why the SB Pro and LPT 1 can share an IRQ, please do so. Thanks 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 As of today I will no longer be a contact for Zeos International on the net. This responsibility has been taken over by another tech (davidm@zeos.com) and I am moving up and on (mo money, mo money :)). I just wanted to thank all of the netters who have supported and encouraged the participation of Zeos on the net. I personally feel it is important for companies such as Zeos to provide their customers with as easy access as possible when they have questions/problems and being on the net is an big step in the right direction. I hope that other companies will follow suit (as Weitek and others have done). Again, thanks. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 We are trying to install a donated hard disk (Miniscribe vintage 1988) on a supercheap ancient Compaq XT for use in education. The only problem is that the supercheap Compaq didn't come with the manual and I haven't been able to figure out how to start the SETUP" 'program. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I bought a 386DX33 system a little over 2 years ago, and was satisfied with everything about Zeos. That computer went off to grad school with my son and I replaced it with a 486DX2/66 pkg 4 (345 MBHD, 16MB ram) with Diamond Viper, 128K level 2 cache, and tower upgrades, delete the CTX monitor. I got a 17" HP D1193A monitor employee purchase. This is a *great* system, fast, quiet, solidly built, not a single glitch bringing it up. Tech support seems busier now than 2 years ago. I called with a configuration question, and they called back 4 hours later with the right answer. I think there's a slight premium over Gateway prices, but IMHO Zeos is worth it. BTW they have enough 800 lines that I've never gotten a busy signal calling sales, customer service, or tech support. Now, you usually wait 5 or 10 minutes to talk to someone, but at least you get in the queue and wait on their dime. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Excuse me to every one. I am an Amiga owner and tired to have the same graphic modes. So I saw on nn there was a little bridgeboard that made the Amiga's PC slots communicate with the stanndard Amiga's slot. The building mother house of this little gadget assure me that using this thing I can use all the pc boards included the SVGA cards. I am interested in computer graphics and I do not know many things about pc in general. So, what is the best (ISA slot) card on the market ? I'd like to reach resolutions like 1280x1024 with 256 colors or 800x600 with 24 bitplanes.

Etc.... Thanks. --Kent 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I don't know if this is an obvious question, but can any of the current batch of windows accelerator cards (diamond etc) be used to drive a monitor which has RGB and horizontal and vertical sync ( 5 BNC jacks altogether) connectors out the back?? I might be able to get ahold of a Raster Technologies 17" monitor (1510 ??)cheap and I was wondering if it was possible to connect it via an adapter (RGB to vga ??) to my Gateway, would I need different drivers etc. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 The 2 lines are not a result of the high end trinitron tube, these 2 wires will be found on all 17" trinitron tubes (e.g., Mitsubishi 17", Sony 1604, etc). On 14" Sony tubes, you'll find one wire. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I think it's simply because DOS doesn't use the IRQ for anything. OS/2 does, so with that you can't share the IRQ. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 There is a premium of approx $200 for the controller. What is nice is being able to run hard disks, tape drives, cd-roms and scanners of one dma channel and interupt! 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 and and Orchid P9000. In short, I am happy with the monitor and unhappy with the card. I have spent a lot more time futzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about. The monitor is pretty. The moires I had under Simcity on my 17" Magnavox went away. It isn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think). So much for the monitor. On to the bitch session and test results. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I'd like to add a second S3 based video card to my system. Does anyone know of a company that sells a card that can coexist with another one? All I really need is color text on one monitor and fast color graphics on the other. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Still no good. WatchIT TV will not work on a with local bus video. It will not work in any high reolution modes either. The people who make the card assure me that they will have a card available in June that supports both local-bus and hi-res. BTW does anyone know the name of the company who makes watchit tv? Phone #? BBS? Internet? 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 The joystick reads in anolog values through a digital port. How? You send a command to the port to read it, then you time how long it takes for the joystick port to set a certain bit. This time is proportional to the joystick position. Obviously, since time is used as a position, you cannot get rid of this ridiculus waste of time. If you wrote your own routine instead of the BIOS, it would speed it up some, but the time would still be there. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I've been trying to get my Fujitsu M2611T 45mb hard disk (circa 1990) to share my IDE card with a new Seagate ST3283A 245mb one.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 About two months ago I purchased the Adaptec ASW-410 driver for use with a CD-ROM drive. At the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation I had with my Adaptec SCSI controller said that this is the driver to be used with CD-ROM drives. Since then I have learn that this driver is out of date in a major way and that Adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver (I think it's called EZI-SCSI or something). I wasn't too fussed about this until I upgraded by CD-ROM drive from a Sony CDU-541 to a Sony CDU-641. I now find that the audio-mode will not work. I assume it is not being handled correctly by the ASW-410 driver. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I've started to notice the same thing myself. I'm running DOS 5 and Win 3.1 so I can fix it from the Windows Control Panel. At times it is the date, at others the clock seems to be running several minutes behind where it should be.

[I've got a vested interest, since my machine's busted and I have to use his until I get mine fixed.] He already has a Seagate 85MB IDE HD (again, I forget the model number but I can find out.) 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 the statment "correct"?) Even if you could make such a statement it would be meaningless unless you understood that ESDI and IDE (I include SCSI and ATA) are completely different (ESDI is device-level, like MFM/RLL).

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I was just reading in PC Magazine that the peripherals in a PC with an ISA bus can only access 16MB of memory. Also, that some video cards on the ISA bus look for a memory aperture to map their memory to. So that if I wanted to put 16MB of memory on my PC, my video card wouldn't have anywhere to map it's memory to.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I am looking for an inexpensive vlb card, and have yet to run across any real reviews of them. One of the cards the local stores are pushing is the Genoa 8500 for $125-140. Apparently it uses a Cirrus Logic acc. chip, but I don't know which one (GD5426?). One of the shops I've spoken with claims the card out-performs the Diamond Stealth 24 vl and the Orchid Fahrenheit 1280 plus vl cards (S3 86C805 based), but that can't be true if it is using the GD5426. I like the price of the Genoa 8500, but if it lags in performance behind the S3 cards, I'll pay the extra $50 for one of them. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I think the original respondent (Guy Dawson?) was refering to something much more elementary.

This will happen almost every time, whether I've just booted up, reset, or finished using a dos program. Everything works fine if I don't let it sit. Windows is a different story. If I let the machine sit while in windows for 15 minutes or more, it does not freeze up. However, I do get frequent application errors that kick me out of an application unexpectedly, losing my work. I just don't know if this is a hardware or software problem. Any help in diagnosis or things to try, would be greatly appreciated. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I have a Conner-disk model CP30061G (200Mb ??) with no info at all. The only thing I know is that is normally used with Compaq-machines. Please, send me information on switch-settings, geometry and so on. It looks like a normal IDE-disk but is it possible to use it with a standard IDE-controller?? 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Hi! I got hold of an old Zenith 286 Laptop with model# ZWL-183-45 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 For what it's worth (I haven't confirmed it), a Diamond tech-rep told me that ALL S3-based video cards use port addresses 0x2E0 and 0x2E8. If this is true, it appears that you canNOT use more than one S3 card in your system. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I'm trying to transfer some software between two machines and I'm having real trouble. My own Intel 14.4k ( v32/v32bis/v42/v42bis) works fine--I just talk to it at 56k and everything comes out clear. This other modem, at the other machine, is a "Turbomodem+" from "The Complete PC" (the machines are in seperate houses, so a direct serial link is impossible, and copying this much data to disk is a pain--easier to turn the machines on for a few hours and go see a movie--no, this is not pirated software). 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Is there a FAQ on Cyrix 486DLC? Could anyone please repost it or email to me, if I missed it? Thanks in advance. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Then don't complain (maybe it wasn't you) that SCSI was so expensive on PC's because all we've had until a year or two ago was the ISA bus. (ie no one buys SCSI for ISA because ISA is slow) Are you saying that SCSI on an ISA bus is not an automatic winner when compared to IDE? 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I have one and it is my favorite CD-ROM drive so far. I also have a NEC-74 and have had experience with several other drives (Various Phillips drives) 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I got two very similar sounding boards for dirt cheap, too. Their Assy numbers were not 4000-series, but your description fits otherwise. They are 3Com 3C505's aka Etherlink Plus cards. Check out ftp.3com.com, there are drivers and diagnostic programs for just about any and all 3Com cards. I concluded that my card was the 505 after I ran their diagnostic program for 3C505 succesfully ("..passes with flying colours") :) 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Once in a while you have to put in a good word for something that works well. I have had no problems with my Toshiba 3401. It works very well with DOS and OS/2. For OS/2, you don't need to load any special drivers. The installation will detect that it is a Toshiba drive and you are done. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Except for the fact that it's superior in just about every way to the ISA Bus. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 We are trying to connect an Olivetti XM4311 5" floppy drive as the second drive on a Panasonic 286 machine. It seems to sort of talk to it (gets it spinning and stepping) but gives a "Disk not ready" error. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 IDE also uses DMA techniques. I believe floppy controller also uses DMA, and most A/D boards also use DMA. DMA is no big deal, and has nothing to do directly with SCSI. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 My fiance has a pc-junior and wants to upgrade to a full 386. Does anyone know if we could use the monitor it came with on a new machine? I heard it's MCGA or EGA, but not sure which. Also, does it use cards, so we can use the drive controller, floppy, etc? 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Pentium processors / motherboards are not available to the general public as of yet. Intel has released them to companies such as Gateway and Dell to do testing, etc. It'll be a while... 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I'm buying a new system this week to replace my brain dead 286, and could use some feedback on a couple systems I'm looking at if anyone is familiar with them. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Since the Mac uses ONLY SCSI-1 for hard drives YES the "figure includes a hundred $$$ for SCSI drivers" This is sloppy people and DUMB. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 The only things you'll be able to salvage from the junior are the floppy drives and monitor. The floppies are 360k, and the monitor is CGA, but you will need an adaptor cable to use it. The junior does not use standard cards. Unless you're really strapped for cash, you should just junk the thing and buy new stuff. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I have heard that there is something called a $25.00 Network that allows two PC's to be networked by joining their serial ports. Does someone out there know anything about this? I would greatly appreciate e-mail on this! 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 The BusLogic cards have an OS/2 2.0 driver that does work with the March 2.1 beta. Support for the BusLogic cards is not included with OS/2 2.0 any longer. If you wish to install the beta from the CD/ROM, you will need to REM out the Adaptec device drivers, as they have a nasty tendency to crash the BusLogic cards when OS/2 attempts to use them. (Thanks Adaptec!)

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 We had the same problem in our company. We changed the keyboard-bios and after that, everything went fine. Our dealer told us that some boards of that series have a defect kbd-bios. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 No, but some OS's ( COHERENT , etc ) are able to drive one of the ports in polled mode without using the IRQ. In your example, after accessing the modem, the mouse won't work until you reboot, because the IRQ is used by the modem.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I saw the following computer in a store and wanted to know if this is a good computer or does someone see something wrong with it. I also would like to switch the motherboard later when this computer becomes too slow. Does anyone know if this is possible with a Leading Edge Computer, or will it be difficult to find a motherboard that will fit in this computer. Any help will be greatly appreciated. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I did this. I use a relay (Radio Shack 4PDT) instead of a huge switch. This way, if the relay breaks, my drives will still work. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 OK, I'll try one more time with this one. If ANYONE out there has ANY information on MicroScience hard drives and how to set the jumpers (and where they are?) for master/slave configurations. I will gladly accept any info, as I have a 110M'er sitting in my room collecting dust just waiting for me to install huge applications. :) Thanks in advance. (And yes, I regulary check the IDE Harddisk Spec that is posted here.) 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I recently bought a Leading Edge 80386DX-33 <mini tower case and everything works fine. Leading Edge seems to be a decent brand and what-not. I would tend to say that it is a decent deal. The only things you might want to be wary about is that my L.E. computer has a back-plane mounted motherboard. Ie: The motherboard itself is a card that can be plugged in to a backplane. Some people don't like these configurations. The second thing is that whoever set up my computer at the factory didn't really know what they were doing. The installed windows video driver didn't even take advantage of the SVGA card/Monitor. Look forward to configuring the system optimally yourself. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I can definitily say that you can use an RLL as Master and IDE as slave, as I have just upgraded my machine with a 200Mb IDE ( And custom Controller Mdl CI-1010 Extended IDE Controller ) While maintaining my RLL'd Wren as master Drive. The trick is the controller which supports up to 4 IDE Drives while coexisting with existing Controllers ( MFM,RLL,ESDI,SCSI ). 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 There is a simple answer. If my memory serves me the scsi bios will only work as the first or second drive. Any "built-in" drives e.g. IDE are installed first and then when the scsi bios runs it will try to install as the next drive. But if there are already two drives, then no can do. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Most of these are single-scan monitors, which are useless for most PC users. I posted requests for information in other newsgroups which were mostly fruitless, but I have managed to track down two multisync grayscal monitors in the 17-21" range, one 20" and one 21". I am still looking into it, and I will post the results when I get more info. I am looking into a group purchase as well. -- |)aniel Thumim dthumim@mit.edu 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I have a Tseng labs video card that gives me problems when I do anything in super VGA mode. CHECKIT v3.0 reports a Video Page Frame Address Error at Page Frame #7. What does this mean and how (if I can) could this be fixed? The card Says ET4000Ax on it. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Can anybody please help me with information on the use of the bi-directional printer port. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 With a sound card on interrupt 5, two serial ports (one for modem on i4, one for Miracle Piano on i3) and a printer port on i7, I have run out of low interrupts. What I would like is a mouse port with an interrupt of 10, 11, or 12 (which ever interrupt the PS/2 mouse port uses) in in ISA i486 computer. I called technical support of Microsoft, Logitech, & ATI (checked what interrupts the mouse port on the ATI video cards can use) and they all said the only interrupts possible on these cards was ones lower than 7. Does anyone know of any board for an ISA bus which will allow a mouse port (or even a serial port) with high interrupts? 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Of course you should be able to write a DD 720Kb disk without making any holes. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 If anyone has any experience with the ALR ProVEISA 486DX2 system I would be interested to hear your impressions of it, and of ALR in general. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Try putting one of the IRQs for your COM ports onto IRQ2. The hardware will automagically wrap IRQ2 to IRQ9 on AT class machines (eg, anything with high IRQs). This is what I'm doing on my set up right now. I've got COM2 on IRQ2 (really IRQ9 - address it this way in software), COM1 on IRQ3, SoundBlaster on IRQ5, LPT1 on IRQ7, and my ATI BusMouse port on one of the interrupts in between. Works just great. If you need even more, there's a text file floating around somewhere that details how to hack up any serial card (and probably any others) to work on the higher IRQs. It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the 16bit expansion bus.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I am looking at buying some Companion brand VLB/ISA/EISA motherboards with HINT chipsets. Has anybody had any experience with this board (good or bad)? Any information would be helpful! 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I am writting a program that checks a computer for its configuration. It's going to be run everytime a computer boots up to our campus network. (Actually, it already is running, it's just not getting all the info I want it to yet...) Anyway, I want to check for a mouse. I already check for a mouse driver (using the code in Microsoft's Mouse book). But there is no guarantee that the driver is loaded when my program runs, or that they ever load the driver. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 There is a way in which a multi-tasking computer actually gives you more CPU power then you had before, and that is with I/O overlap. With I/O overlap, your CPU can continue to "think" while disk operations are underway, whereas without overlap, your CPU sits idly waiting for each disk operation to finish - and disk operations take an *eternity*, compared to a fast CPU. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 The Adaptec 1540-series use bus mastering. This means that the CPU doesn't sit waiting for data bytes, it can go off and do other computing - if you have an advanced multi-tasking OS, that is. DOS just sits and waits anyway. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 IDE does not do DMA. This is because it's like te PC AT hard disk interface. The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the controller card, then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to main memory where it's needed. If IDE doesn't work this way, then it's not compatible. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I just picked up a second-hand "color option" for the NEC P5200 24pin dot matrix printer. Alas, there were no installation instructions, so I am totally confused on WHY it WON'T GO IN! 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I hate to burst your bubble but you cannot "slip in a B:" to that particular AMI BIOS setting. That setting only allows you to set the *boot order* of the floppy A: with respect to the primary HD C:, i.e., check A: first, then C: or check C:, then A:.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I have a new MR535 Mitsubishi hard drive (RLL or MFM) that has been in storage and will not format. I suspected that the switch settings may have been moved in the movement of the drive from one place to another. Does anyone have the switch settings for this drive. It has J1 SW1 with 6 switches and SW2 has 8 switches. SW2 is the one that selects the drive number. If you have info on this drive, or know a number I can call to configure it, please, please let me know by email. It has 977 cyl 5 heads and I think is type 17. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 One of the monitors I reviewed for the June issue of Windows Magazine was the Mitsubishi. I also reviewed a new Nanao, the F550iW, which has just been released. Last year for the May '92 issue of Windows, I reviewed several monitors, including the Nanao T560i. There's no question that the Nanao monitors are the best available this year, just as they were last year. The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the ranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing criteria and the scoring. I used different tests than they did, and I scored differently. There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi, and it scored very highly in my tests, but it was a few points shy of perfect. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 You need a monitor cable that has a VGA connector on one end and five BNC connectors on the other. I bought one from Nanao when I bought the Nanao monitor I use, which also has five BNC connectors. Check with a computer store that sells good monitors. Quite a few companies use that setup. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Yeah. Sounds typical. Windows makes all sorts of extra demands on hardware, and therefore your machine can't keep up with things. Ever notice how when acessing the floppies in Windows, everything else slows to a crawl? I imagine your backup and evertyhing else that is running fights for CPU time, and sometimes the backup program loses. Be glad. I can't even run in medium speed with CP backup on my machine, supposedly because I have a SCSI machine which places extra demands on the data bus. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 What's the difference between the F550i and the new F550iW? I'm about to buy a Gateway system and was going to take the F550i upgrade. Should I get the F550iW instead? 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 conner peripherals has a 1-800 number with a touch-tone /voice response data bank giving all the info. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Another (albeit strange) option is using a program like 800 II (available via anonymous FTP at many major sites), or FDFORMAT (also available via anonymous FTP), that allows you to format 5.25HD disks to 1.44Meg, or 3.5"HD disks to 1.2Meg (along with many MANY other formats!) so you can DISKCOPY (yes, the broken MeSsy-DOS DISKCOPY!) the 5.25" disks onto 3.5" disks or vice versa... I use this techniques with "NON-DOS" self-booting game disks on my old Tandy 1000, and it works... Another program named Teledisk (shareware--available on many major BBS's) will also make the weird format disks, provided you have 800 II or FDFormat installed.... Some disks that won't DISKCOPY properly can be readily Teledisk'd into the proper format... At least this is a software solution for a hardware/BIOS deficiency, eh? 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I have a quick question regarding the Rockwell Chipset that's`come out relatively recently--It supports v.32, v.32bis, v.42, Group III Fax, and so on... However, I heard there are bugs in the chipset. I know someone that has a ZOOM 14.4 Modem that uses the chipset, and he hasn't had a problem. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 well people, I can only recomend the non-flat-screen, no-hype, no-nonsense NEC 3DS that I have, and PLUS, it has the ADVANTAGE of NOT having one of those new flat screen tubes which are oversensitive and fragile and break often! this is a 15'' heavy-duty rugged set for those who insist on well-proven reliable technologies!

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Windows: The recent reviews have all shown that the P9000 cards are significantly faster doing Windows than the ATI card. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I have had a Gateway Telepath modem for about a month or so now. Actually, I had one that wouldn't connect to ANYTHING no matter what software I used, so I got a new one sent to me. This allows me to connect to my favorite News system with ZERO problems. So I'm somewhat happier .... 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 The one I got only does about 4kb/s in text and 320x200 (VGA/MCGA) mode, which is almost identical to the other W5186 based cards (ATI 68800 does about 6kb/s). This is weird since the Orchid supposedly should be much faster (and I was told by someone that it can do almost 16 kb/s), since the VGA chip is covered by the Orchid label, I can't really tell for sure if it uses a 5286 chip, but the spec. sheet that comes with the board (no docs!) did say it has 1 meg dram and uses a 5286 chip. Winmarks (3.11) is about 4 mil. slower than a Viper (34 vs ~38) using standard palette. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 One more thing to add, the Orchid board vesa bios is only able to handle the 1 meg dram on board, the Viper however can utilize the 2 meg vram on board to support vesa modes such as 1280x1024x256, 800x600x16 mil. and 1024x768x65536 under Dos. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Would someone please email me the pinout for a PS/2 6-pin mini DIN mouse port? I'm trying to make an adapter for a serial mouse, and the dealer who knows what adapter works with the mouse I bought doesn't have it in stock. I have several different adapters, but none of them make sense based on what sketchy information I have about the port (they have connections to "reserved" pins). 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I agree that the image is as sharp as it gets with these SONY tubes, however in the 17" monitors using these tubes, the 2 annoying black lines on the top and bottom quarters of the tube, which are created due to the wires holding up the Invar Shadow Mask, are quite annoying after a while. That is the only thing that is making me lean more in favor of the NEC 5FG (or now also available the NEC 5FGe - only difference, no ACCUCOLOR ). Any experiences or opinions from people who have used the NEC 5FG would be appreciated since I want to get one right after my exams are all done (ie: about a week from now). 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 The Quantum LPS 240AT is supposed to have a 256K cache on the IDE controller built into the card. Yet when I do a DOS DIR command on my system, the disk is always accessed (I can hear the mechanical movement of the heads). Why is this happening? Strangely, even when I have smartdrive installed, every DIR command accesses the disk. Did I somehow de-activate the cache? This is happening on each of two machines with an LPS 240AT drive. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I am looking for a company that can make custom keys. For instance we need a key that says HELP, MAIN MENU, etc which we are going to use instead of F1,F2, F3 etc... Can anyone point me to a company that does this. Also do you have to have a special keyboard, or can I just pop off the old keys and pop in the new ones... 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Not only do you lose AccuColor, you also had to give up 1280x1024 non-interlaced mode, the wider 135 Mhz bandwidth and the Mac and BNC inputs of the 5FG. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 There were an assortment of firmware problems, but that is pretty much expected with any FAX/modem talking with a different FAX or modem which may have also been revised or is new. I'm pretty much oblivious to any current firmware problems, so you'll have to get it from someone else. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Do you have the specs for this monitor? What have they changed from the F550i? 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I read about the development of EISA-2 some time ago but dismissed it in light of the intense interest in VESA and PCI. However, I recently was disheartened to hear that ISA cannot address more than 16mb of RAM, a limit that too many of us will hit all too soon. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 There would be no problems as long as the OS didn't set up a DMA transfer to an area above the 16 mb area (the DMA controller probably can't be programmed that way anyways, so there probably isin't a problem with this) 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Unfortunately there a *LOT* of such software. I also find it to be the case that the majority of the software that is BAD in this regard is COMMERCIAL software. Way too many commercial packages are very poorly written. But then most of the programs in MS-DOS are crap, such as the PRINT command TSR that locks up your system for long periods of time when the printer is full instead of trying every clock tick. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 This past winter I found myself spending a ridiculous amout of time in front of my computer. Since my eyes were going berserk, I decided to shell out some serious money to upgrade from a 14" to a 17" monitor. I'm running 800x600 at 72 Hz. My eyes are very grateful. However, I find myself using a smaller font with less eye strain. Has anyone else had this kind of experience? I thought that small fonts were the culprit but it seems that flicker was my real problem. Any comments? 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Very possibly, but if it's still going to be backwards compatible with the ISA bus, it's going to be the same tripe that the current EISA implementation really is. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I bet it suddenly started sticking when you started leaving the PC running the menu all night. There is a limitation/bug in the date roll-over software in PC's that means you have to be doing something like waiting for keyboard input via a DOS call rather than a BIOS call (as menus often use) otherwise the code to update the date after midnight never gets called. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I recently decided to try using emm386.exe for a memory manager and when I tried to print to my printer in lpt1 from word55 I wouldn't work. It would send the linefeeds for the top margin and then the printer READY light would go off and stop working. I disabled emm386.exe and the problem went away. I would like to continue using emm386.exe if possible. I would greatly appreciate any comments or suggestions!! please send them to arthur@u.washingt, 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 They don't have a conflict because technically LPT1: does not use IRQ7!. The Parallel printer processor (the actual number escapes me) contains a printer control register which enables the chip to transmit an interrupt to the interrupt controller as IRQ7, then onto the main processor as Int 0x0F. By default the parallel printer processor does not enable it's interrupt line therefore no Int 0x0F's will be sourced from the printer controller chip, thus enabling other devices to use the actual IRQ7.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Is it possible to have 2 Sound Blasters in 1 machine? Would give your the equivalent of a SB Pro but with stereo Digitized sound. The way Creative Labs price Pro's in Oz, the price is equal. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Did I once hear that in order for the date to advance, something, like a clock, *has* to make a Get Date system call? Apparently, the clock hardware interrupt and BIOS don't do this (date advance) automatically. The Get Date call notices that a "midnight reset" flag has been set, and then then advances the date. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Computers are a special case.. and it's a pretty good idea to leave them on.. cuz everytime you turn on a computer, you're putting a surge of electricity through its delicate components. Imagine you're turning on your computer 5 or more times a day. You're increasing the chances of damaging the chips, memory, etc on all the components of your computer. So you may save a few cents here and there in electricity bills, but it won't look like much when it come time to fix your computer.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I can wait 'cos I've already got an accelerated card. It does 1280x1024 but only 16 colour. You may mock me, but such cards will be here quickly enough. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I'm not sure if this will work, but how about using one of those 'T' expanders used in the low-profile cases. They allow 3-5 slots staggered on either side of the card. You can install it in the last slot, and then (probably) have 2 or 3 sideways slots. This is actually how it is done in the low profile cases - a standard motherboard, the 'T' connector in one slot, and the expansion cards plugged into the 'T'. I guess you could do this at each end of the slots (1 & 8) to add even more. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 My computer won't recognise my disk after a reboot (Windows crash - Grrr!!) Are there any options to restore everything, without losing data?

But you must stand a pretty hard enviroment without breaking apart, jumnping on it or trying to use it outdoor while it is raining and so forth. I need 640Kb of memory and a convinient way of loading applications into it that I wrote myself (floppy or somekind of writeable cartridge?). 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 no argument on going direct to National (see my previous post on this topic), but some info regarding what you said above. I don't know about the 8250 or 16450, but NS was the original source for the 16550 series (and I strongly suspect that they developed the others first, too).

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I recently bought a Micron 486DX/33 VLB computer and the the local bus ide card was getting around 1k/s transfer rates (says norton). I caled micron because this seemed pathetically slow and they said that norton 6.xx doesn't recognize local bus and won't give accurate results. I was told I would need norton 7.0 in order to get a true account of my ide transfer speed. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Contrary to what others might have thought, I actually did have a SCSI drive once. It was the Seagate 296N and the ST-02 controller. I found that the controller couldn't keep up with a 1:1 interleave, so the best I could do with the drive was a 2:1 interleave and a data transfer of about 450 k/sec. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Hi! I was wondering if anyone out there could point me to where I can get the VESA specifications or any relevant books on this subject. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Someone Else, could you please comment on that. I have just bought a Twincom 14.4DFi, which has a Rockwell chipset. It wasn't cheap so I would like to hear of problems I'm likely to run into. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Can somone explain to me all the stuff about modems... like v.32 v.42 HST USRobotics... 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Yeah, there is absolutely no use for VLB except for video graphics. And no IDE could possibly take advantage the VLB, because it runs at 8 Mhz and 16 bits. Do people forget that the IDE was specifically designed to interface directly with the AT ISA bus? We've seen IDEs come out for EISA, XT ISA, and now even MCA, but at all times it was a 16 bit standard, running at somewhere near 8-10 Mhz. When you run an IDE off of the VLB, there's no way that you're running it at 33 Mhz, it would burn up. Of course same goes for SCSI, ESDI, whatever, none of them run at CPU speed. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I am unable to get my Gateway 486DX2/66 to run Windows in 1280x1024. I ordered a 2M ATI Ultra Pro, and I'm pretty sure the 2M is really there because I *can* select 1024x768x65536. But no matter what I do with the Flex program in the ATI's program group, 1280x1024 remains ghosted out. I have Windows 3.1, build 59 of the drivers, DOS 5.0. The drivers were installed by Gateway, not by me, so perhaps there's a file missing from the hard drive. It runs 1024x768 just fine. I did go into the Desktop window and select 1280x1024. Sometimes it refuses (ghosted out), other time it accepts it, but when I hit OK and re-enter Desktop, it's back to 1024x768. At no time does it unghost 1280x1024 in the main Flex window. Help! 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Could some kind soul please email ma a response since i don't have much time to read this group. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Maybe you need to go into mach32install and set a refresh rate for 1280x1024. You might need to use custom monitor option.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 And again...... title says it all. WHY? 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 According to what others have told me, the ST-296N is difficult to run at the 1:1 interleave even though Seagate claims it. I have a non-pc system (don't ask what it is, you probably haven't heard of it) that is built around SCSI and it can't do 1:1, either. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 We have plenty of computer labs where the computers are left on all the time. I don't see any shorter lifespan than the ones we have in the offices which does get turned off at the end of the day. In fact, some of the computers in the labs have outlived some of the same ones in the offices. But it goes both ways so can't conclude anything.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I have a Colorado Memory Systems Jumbo 250 tape backup unit in my Gateway 486/33V Tower system. I have found the supplied backup capability to be fairly unreliable. In approx 3 cases out of 10, I have had the backup fail at one point or another, often hanging in the middle of writing the tape. Seek errors, drive communication errors seem to be most common. I use the DOS backup software from Colorado Memory Systems. Should I return the drive, get some better backup software, reformat the tapes (am using CMS tapes)? Any hints would be appreciated - this stuff is to time-consuming to do over and over again until it cooperates...

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I have just installed a Diamond Stealth 24 ISA card in a '486DX2-66 system with 256K cache, and 16 megs of memory, that gets about a 126 SI 6.0 CPU Benchmark rating. Using the 1024x768x16 color driver under Windows, I am getting a Winbench Winmarks rating of only about 9.5 Million. Since I have heard that others get 15-to-16 million for this card, I assume that something is very wrong with my setup.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I have a DEC NT 486DX33 that has an Adaptec SCSI controller, hard disk and cd-rom drive. When I add a 3COMM Ethernet card (3C503) and reboot the system I receive an error message that a boot device cannot be found. Pull the 3COMM card and reboot, everything is fine. I've moved the controller and 3COMM card to various slots, different positions (slot before the controller, slot after the controller) with the same result. DEC hasn't responded to the problem yet. Any help would be appreciated. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Most importantly, which Winbench version are you using? On my local bus ATI Graphics Ultra Pro, I've gotten various Winbench scores from 15.8 million to 31 million winmarks, depending on the version. Winbench 2.5 gives the most optimistic scores, 3.11 gives the least. A winmark rating is meaningless without a corresponding version number. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I also have a DX2/66 and a Maxtor 212. I have a local bus IDE controller (generic) and I get 985 KB/s. I tried swapping my local bus IDE controller for an ISA IDE controller and my transfer rate went to 830 KB/s. The specs for this drive show a maximum platter to controller transfer rate of 2.83 MB/s. I dont know how to get there from here. The local bus interface got me a little, but certainly not as much as I had hoped. I am also looking for a way to improve my disk performance, but Im not convinced that the controller is the bottleneck (although Im willing to entertain the possibility that it is). I am already running a big main memory disk cache, so Im not really interested in this solution either.

If anyone knows for sure what the scoop is, I would like to know also. Thanks in advance also. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I have a 386/40 motherboard with AMI BIOS. I haven't located the little motherboard manual yet, and suddenly it's giving me 10 beeps when I turn the power on.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I think the difference is about 400 dollars, but I could be wrong. These things change between press time and publication. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 However, also be aware that Implementor's notes are basicly recommendations, they are *NOT* part of the spec. As others have noted, many vendors (including SGI) violate this. Indeed, the main point is to reduce impedance changes, and therefore reflections, and therefore 'noise' on the bus.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Well, some quick math on my part shows that an 8.3MHz bus, 16 bits wide, performing a transfer every two clock cycles will provide 8.3M bytes/sec. Someone said that it really takes 3 clock cycles to perform a transfer, so that reduces the transfer rate to 5.5MB/s, which is the commonly-used figure for ISA bus speed. However, I believe a two-clock transfer is possible (0 wait states).

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I have a Gateway 4DX-33V with my 3.5 inch floppy as drive A. I accidentally discovered that if a have a floppy from ONE particular box of diskettets in the A drive when I boot up, rather than getting the "Non-system diskette" message, the machine hangs and the CMOS gets overwritten (luckily, Gateway sends a print of the standard CMOS settings with their systems). This only happens with a box of pre-formatted Fuji disks that I have, no other disks cause this problem. If I re-format one of the Fuji disks, the problem goes away. I did a virus scan (scan v1.02) of the disks and found nothing.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I had this problem some time ago. Some BIOSes do not automatically install COM3 or COM4 in the port tables. Programs like most modem programs which write directly to the port work fine but anything that uses a BIOS call fails. Find a BBS or FTP site where you can get a copy of PORT FINDER. Put "device=pf.sys" in your config.sys or run pf.com from your autoexec.bat. This little program will locate all existing ports and make sure the BIOS tables are updated. It works great.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 you need to massage few switches in your system.ini. in the virtual memory section, flip the 32bitaccess switch on and the associated driver (wdctl or some such) switch on. this will enable 32bit access, but be sure you can use it, as not all hard drives and controllers support it !

This causes digital multiscan monitors like my MAG MX17F to get confused as to which mode to use if the frequency gets too far from the standard selections. For this reason, I use the "factory defaults" for position/size on the ATI card and adjust each mode individually (only the first time) at the monitor. The MAG (and many other multiscan monitors) has (have) the ability to recall these settings the next time each mode is "detected". 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I used the standard installation program to put MS-DOS 6.0 on my machine with Stacker 3.0 already installed. No problems. I kept Stacker, rather than switch. I am very pleased with the memory I gained since I did not have a memory manager. I also like the multiple boot feature. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I am interrested in the extrodinarily simple concept of the null modem cable. (Actually I have NO idea, so don't count that last statement.) What I'm asking is what pins does it use (or what are it's specifications?) I just want to solder one myself instead of buying one. I don't even know what port is used. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 For those of you who might be familiar with Insight Distribution Network, Inc. and their Multimedia Kits: 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Has anyone taken a look at the new ViewSonic 17? They claim 1280x1024 at 76Hz. How does it compare with the T560i in terms of price, and quality of display? 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I just installed a DX2-66 CPU in a clone motherboard, and tried mounting a CPU cooler on the chip. After about 1/2 hour, the weight of the cooler was enough to dislodge the CPU from its mount. It ended up bending a few pins on the CPU, but luckily the power was not on yet. I ended up pressing the CPU deeply into its socket and then putting the CPU cooler back on. So far so good. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I believe that any VL/EISA/ISA motherboard that uses the HINT chipset is limited to 24-bit EISA DMA (where 'real' EISA DMA is 32-bit). The HINT EISA DMA has the 16 mb ram addressing limitation of ISA. For this reason I would pass. I own one of these (HAWK VL/EISA/ISA) and am look- ing to replace it for exactly this reason.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I have had a Zeos for a couple months. While the experience was not painless or perfect, it was way better than that endured by most (7 people I personally know) who have ordered Gateways. (Of course, several of the Gateway buyers were rewarded by getting free stuff as Gateway can't seem to keep track of what it has or hasn't sent out...B{) 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Hello, I am trying to hook an Apple Imagewriter to my IBM Clone. I seem to have a problem configuring my lpt port to accept this. How can you adjust baud, parity, etc. to fit the system? I tried MODE, but it did not work. If anyone can help, post of e-mail. Thanx. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I seem to recall that 486s run somewhere close to the boiling point of water. Anyone have an exact temperature? 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 This is not the case: the ROM on the P9000 supports VESA modes of up to 1024x768 in 256 colors. VESA-compliant applications should have no trouble setting these modes. (But I'm forwarding your posting to our Software group, just in case. Can't be too careful.) Not that I doubt that YOUR applications are failing to run; lots of stuff depends on figuring out which exact SVGA they're looking at, and don't use VESA calls (VESA is still pretty new). Every new chip set confuses them. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Hi there. We just bought a 486 DX2/66 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATI Ultra Pro video card. Everything seems to work fine except for the Windows Drivers for 800x600 24 bit, and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit modes. The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup, and within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally unintelligible. Naturally, I called Gateway tech support to inquire about this. The technician asked me about the drivers, and I told him it was version 1.5, build 59. He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for the ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!! Is this true? If so, I'm simply amazed. How could this be? The strange thing is I would have expected to see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!). 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I've been troubleshooting the existence of way too many General Protection Faults on a 486-33, Eisa-VLB, system. At this point I think I've narrowed the problem down to the video drivers for the Volante Warp-10 adapter by National Design, INc. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I have a 486DX 25mhz with local bus. Would I see much of an increase in speed in my drives if I got a VESA IDE controller card? I need advice! 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 This may be a dumb question, but I need to put a hard drive on my father's PC/XT, either MFM, RLL, or IDE. I know how to hook it up, but how do I tell the computer the geometry of the drive. On my 386, you set it in the BIOS, but I doubt that's how it's done on an XT. I thought it might be software with the controller card, but the IDE card for XT's that I saw didn't come with any. Also, how do I low level format it once it's on the computer? (Assuming a drive which needs formatting) 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I'm in the market to upgrade my BIOS to a Phoenix 1.10 (got a new hard disk, discovered my BIOS doesn't have a "type 47") and I would like know where I can purchase one of these things. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Me Too!!!!!!! skcgoh@tartarus.uwa.edu.au 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 You are correct! The motherboard manufacturer where I usually buy boards says that they will have this problem fixed in about two weeks... 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I would like to thank all those people who responded to my post. I would, however, like to clear some things up. My tape drive is *external*. Also, the connector on the back of it is of the male DB-37 pin variety. As a result, I cannot easily find a cost-effective solution to use the drive. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Well it seems that I have a soundblaster card for sale since I recently purchased a SBPro. The card comes complete, In mint condition; with box, manuals,docs ,disks and original packaging. Make an offer..._Canadian_ inquiries prefered! Respond before APRIL 28!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I have been able to successfully use both 16 and 24 bit color modes on my Gateway system, although my setup is less complicated than yours. It sounds as if you may have a hardware conflict or problem. Is your memory aperture above 16M? I have heard rumors of incompatibilities with that SCSI card with a variety of systems. Call up Gateway and give them hell until they help you fix it. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 No, VL-bus IDE is no faster than ISA IDE. The IDE interface is fundamentally nothing more than an extension of the ISA bus, and if you hook it to VL-bus it'll work as fast as the slower of the two, meaning ISA speed. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I need some help with a multi port serial board of unknown origin. I'm hoping someone knows what this board is, or, even better, what the various switches and jumbers are used for. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Have you checked: 1/ The setting of drive A: to 1.44 M floppy. 2/ The setting of drive B: to 1.2 M foppy. 3/ The cable connecting the two drives to the controller card (I can't remember which two wires are swapped, but they determine which is drive A: & b:). 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I assume you are talking about 1meg X 9 SIMMs, or 1Meg X 9 SIPPs with speed of 70ns? I would take 10K pieces per week if you have that price. (FOB US port). 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Does anyone have enough experience to report whether disk data compression has any effect on the optimal disk sector interleave? Offhand, I expect that the time required to decompress disk data would increase the optimum disk sector interleave. - Alan Hinds 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Hi. I am trying to set up a Conner 3184 and a Quantum 80AT drive. I have the conner set to the master, and the quantum set to the slave (doesn't work the other way around). I am able to access both drives if I boot from a floppy, but the drives will not boot themselves. I am running MSDOS 6, and have the Conner partitioned as Primary Dos, and is formatted with system files. I have tried all different types of setups, and even changed IDE controller cards. If I boot from a floppy, everything works great (except the booting part :)). The system doesn't report an error message or anything, just hangs there. Does anyone have any suggestions, or has somebody else run into a similar problem? I was thinking that I might have to update the bios on one of the drives (is this possible?). Any suggestions/answers would be greatly appreciated. Please reply to: 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Actually, it does make a reasonable amount of sense. Fixed disk sectors are buffered by the controller, and transferring them to memory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) is quite efficient (single instruction, goes as fast as the controller/cpu know how to use the bus). Since the 286 wasn't cached, the bus is likely a critical resource relative to CPU performance, and it's possible that DMA bus interference would cause as much or more loss of CPU cycles (for 'computing') as does the 'rep insw' sequence. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 There are two 'problems': (1) the BIOS TOD routine which updates the BIOS clock uses only 1 bit for day increment, so a second wrapping of the clock past midnight will get lost if no one calls the BIOS to read the clock in the meantime, and (2) the BIOS resets the day wrap indicator on the first 'get date' call from ANYBODY (after the wrap indicator has been set). So unless the first BIOS 'get date' call after midnight is done by the DOS 'kernel' (which is the only part of DOS which knows how to increment the date, the day wrap indication is normally lost. My guess is that Kevin's 'menu' system uses BIOS calls to read the clock (in order to display the time), and is hence the entity which causes the day wrap indication to get lost. Even if the 'menu' system 'notices' the day 'wrap' (which I think is indicated by a non-zero value in AL), there really isn't any particularly good way to tell DOS about it, so that DOS can update the day. The menu system 'should' use DOS calls to get the time, which would cause the DOS 'kernel' to do the BIOS call, and the wrap indicator would hence be processed properly. Possibly, though, the 'menu' system can't easily use DOS calls for time, because DOS is not reentrant, and perhaps time incrementing ofters occur while the 'menu' system is 'inside' some other DOS call. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Yep, this was on the news. Great news for consumers. Bad news for Intel. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 You might try asking on one of the comp.sys.ibm.* echos (the best one seems more geared toward a PC user wanting to use that monitor, than an Atari user who already can use the monitor (unless maybe they want to really go wild - converting the monitor to VGA, then using it as a VGA monitor with a Falcon :-) 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Is it possible to buy a serial I/O card with the 16550 UART's built in (rather than having to buy them separately, and socketing them in)? 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 It worked!!! Thank you very much! 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 This may be a very naive question but is there any basis for the claim that a CPU will get hotter when a computationally intensive job is running? My friend claims that there will be little difference in the temperature of an idle CPU and a CPU running a computationally intensive job.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I would appreciate the driver name from CICA which functions as a 256 color driver for a Quadtel video card. The type of chip or chipset used would suffice as well. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 i've been using an identical setup, except for the tower config, for several months now. from previous discussions on the net, the first thing to check for is DMA conflicts with other devices, especically if you've got any funky ones. next off, suspect your tape - try a fresh one. good luck !

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I recently bought an AMD 386/40. The motherboard booklet says the board is a "391 WB/H." I have 4 1x3 simms on board. The machine also uses a Super IDE I/O Card (model PT-604). (of course niether the motherboard or the I/O card booklet clearly state who the manufacurers are) I'm also using a Trident 8900C SVGA card. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Cyrix have released a 386 pin-conpatible 486 clone. Designed to upgrade old 16 & 20MHz 386's the chips are also clockdoubling. Thus a 16MHz 386 can be transformed into a 32MHz 486, with a single chip upgrade. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Hi everyone, I have a question regarding my stack on my pc. I am programming in Turbo C 3.0 and my program is rather large (model large too). I keep getting errors that I am running out of memory after a while of running the program. When I compile the program, it says I have 4.45 meg of RAM so I can't seem to explain why it crashes. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I own an 8088 640K clone which does all I want except run 1 game I want to buy. The game says it requires a 80286 with 640K. Game tech. support says game will run on 8088 but uses a some digitized graphics which would make it run really *slow* (it's a card game - Hoyles Classic Card Games, digitized graphics are photos artwork of game fictional card players). 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I don't know the exact meaning of UART, but I think it is something like Universal Arithmetic Receiver Transmitter. Normally, the older boards have a 8250 or 16450 UART on board. Those chips generate an IRQ for every char they received. The 16550 UART has an internal 16 byte buffer, so - with the right software installed - it generates an IRQ every 16 chars. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I just bought a new IDE hard drive for my system to go with the one I already had. My problem is this. My system only had a IDE cable for one drive, so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors on it, and consequently have to switch cables. The problem is, the new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the IDE card. But for the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug in the cable to align these. Secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them. I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into the drives. Does it matter which I plug into the "master" drive and which into the "Slave"? any help appreciated. thanks... 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I have a 486sx25 computer with a 105 Mg Seagate IDE drive and a controler built into the motherboard. I want to add a SCSI drive (a quantum prodrive 425F 425 MG formatted). I have no documentation at all and I need your help! 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Does anybody out there have or used to have an HD controller from Perstor System Inc. (which is out of business I believe)? My friend received an old PC which happens to have such a controller and I am having a hard time trying to add another HD to the card. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I need to buy a SCSI controler for my 486 machine to use with a quantum 425F harddrive. I know that adaptec is good, but they are kind of expensive. Essentially I want a controller in the $100-$150 range that I can use with this drive. I plan to use Windows and later on OS 2.1 when it comes out. Any reccomendations appreciated. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I have been following this mess for a while. excuse my need for clarification. Iam thinking seriously IDE vs. SCSI and this thread could not have come at a better time. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I ran a 386-33 out of a cardboard box for more than a year with no major effects (yeah, no case at all, MB sitting on a static bag) other than the noise from the Poersupply it ran pretty good. as for cooling problems I bought a 12-14 inch fan and turned it on full and set the output directly on the motherboard. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I received a Kaypro 286i computer (DOS) without a manual that describes the jumpers on the motherboard. It came with 640KB and I up'd it to 1MB. But the computer or setup does not recognize the extra 384K. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I believe you are right. Both SCSI and SCSI-2 support 8 devices on the bus (normally that would be the host controller and 7 targets) each of which may have up to 8 logical units (LUNs). 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Has anyone connected a high-res, fixed frequency monitor to their PC? I have a mitubishi monitor that does 1024x768 at 60hz, but won't do any other resolutions. All the video cards designed for this sort of thing are very expensive ($400). Has anyone done it with an SVGA card (I know it can be done, it's just a question of getting the card at the right resolution and frequency)? I'd like to use a mono (hercules) monitor as my dos/command line monitor, and switch to the mitsu for Windows or X-windows (under Linux or 3BSD). 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 Do all SCSI cards for DOS systems require a separate device driver to be loaded into memory for each SCSI device hooked up? Will this also be true of the 32-bit OS's?

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 I have a promovie spectrum, it seems to work very nicely with Video for Windows. With my setup (386-25, 17 ms HD, PAS-16, and orchid F VA), the board could handle up to 15 frame/s. 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	 If you bought your IDE drive from a dealer, you shouldn 't have to perform a low level format. Even if the 1st HD is already partitioned into C and D, FDISK will automatically assign the 2 nd HD to D and change the 2nd partition of 1st drive to E. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Apple has patented their implementation of regions, which presumably includes the internal data structure (which has never been officially documented by Apple). Apple cannot patent the concept of a region. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 My wife has one of these. I have not had much chance to fiddle with it, but in comparison to our Laserwriters with Canon engines, she complains that the print is too light for her taste. The difference is quite apparent even when the print setting on the Select 310 is adjusted to the darkest possible level. I don't find it objectionable, and indeed rather like it, but be warned that some people don't care for it and it is considerably different. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Hi. I am looking into buying a Floptical Drive, and was wondering what experience people have with the drives from Iomega, PLI, MASS MicroSystems, or Procom. These seem to be the main drives on the market. Any advice? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I Have Version 3.5.1 which I believe was needed for a 040 machine. You should be able to get the newest version by calling their tech support at 1-800-456-5522 or if you have a modem you can get the driver from their BBS at 801-778-4400. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I need a device (either an ISA board or a subsystem) which will take two RGB video signals and combine them according to a template. The template can be as simple as a rectangular window with signal one being used for the interior and signal two for the exterior. But I beleive fancier harware may also exist which I do not want to exclude from my search. I know this sort of hardware exists for NTSC, etc. but I need it for RGB. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 This model is one of the two low-cost laser printers that Apple just introduced. I'm thinking of getting one to use at home. Have any of you had any experience with this printer? Does it have Level-2 PostScript? If you've bought one, are you happy with it? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 We're all set to buy one of these for the office, to use for scanning in color photographs and for optical character recognition. We've played with the original grayscale OneScanner and were very pleased. Is the color model comparable in quality? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I saw once an article about a new line of Macs configured to work more optimally as file servers. Anyone know any more details?

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I had asked everyone about problems installing a 4 meg simm and an 8 meg simm in my Centris 610, but the folks at the local Apple store called the folks in Cupertino and found that you can't have simms of different speeds in one machine, even if they are both fast enough - ie - My 80 ns 8 meg and 60ns 4 meg simms were incompatibable... Just thought people might want to know..... Jason. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 There's only one physical size for VRAM SIMMs (unlike DRAM SIMMs which come in many, many sizes and pinouts), although they do come with differing amounts of VRAM on them. The ones you need are 256KB SIMMs, are organized as 128K x 16, and have two 128K x 8 VRAM chips on them. This is the only size which the Quadra and Centris machines can use. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 On a related note, will the 1304 work on a Centris 650 with internal video and give the multiple resolutions? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 other two monitors. It can display Apple 640x480, VGA 640x480, VGA 800x600 (though this has 56 Hz flicker), and Apple 832x624 (75 Hz refresh: no flicker at all). It might be able to display Apple's 1024x768, but I'm not sure about this, and the pixels would be real small anyway so it might not be that useful.

So I got an RMA from La Cie and exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Well, here are the results of the Mathematica test which I posted to this newsgroup. The "test" was the following command: 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Please excuse and redirect me if this has already been answered, but is there a small utility that switches the functionality of the caps-lock key and the ctrl key on the powerbook keyboard? I use the ctrl key far more than caps-lock, so it would be more convenient and comfortable. Thank you for any help, Scott Farrar 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I have a friend who has a MAC (LC or LC II I think), and her family has an "extra" LaserJet IIIp sitting around. Is there any way to connect these two and make them work without a postscript cartridge? She told me that a random friend of hers had mentioned something about some software package that could do the translation... -Rick 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 There's absolutely no reason why differences in the DRAM access time _alone_ would cause an incompatibility. There would have to be another difference between the SIMMs for there to be a problem. I've often used memory of different speeds with no problems whatsoever. As long as it's as fast (or faster) than the minimum requirement you should be fine.

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 When Apple came with their demos to Iowa State, I got a chance to run Speedometer3.1 on some of the new Macs. Both machines were running System7.1, had a 14" RGB. Don't know what the caches were set to. Neither machine had an FPU It appears that the Centris610 is quite a bit faster than the LC III: 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The kit is for an already existing Laserwriter IINTX. It is a ROM upgrade that replaces the font rasterizer code with the more efficient, speedier code that first became available in Adobe Type Manager 1.0. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 My apologies! I goofed. The "quick discharge" option is part of the Connectix PowerBook Utilities package (CPU). I installed it the same day as PowerStrip, and didn't pay enough attention. ;) Anyway, the option does exist for those of you who buy CPU.

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The screws are Torx screws and the tool isn't to hard to find. It's a matter of finding one with a long enough shaft to do the trick. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Could someone direct me to information on SCSI performance for each Mac? (Max throughput, etc.) 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Frankly, I think this model is a screwup. It does not have PostScriptlevel 2, only has 13 fonts, and does not even have fine print or photograde, or grayshare. Even the 300 model has this! I am shocked by the kind of features you get for this printer. I myself was hoping for some decent printer to replace the Personal Laser Writers. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I agree completely, but there was only a refund for people who bought the GC with a Quadra. I have seen an alpha version of an extension from Apple called 8.24 GC QuickTime Video which offloads QuickTime compression/decompression from the cpu to the AM29000 on the card. So it seems it can be done even though in a developer article it states that the GC can't be programmed - but they asked that any suggestions be sent in anyway... 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 the : side and get the Mac OS for 486??? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Shure it is temperature dependent, but this does not clean all your problems. Based on some exp. I must say that the connections between the power supply and the Monitor and Main Board are usable to this failure, Ram simms can be badly connected due to some corrosion and the powersupply can be in the last phase (lower Voltage). 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Nec Toshiba and Sony (Apple) nearly deliver the same speed. As apples prices are very low (compared to there RAM SIMMS) You should buy what is inexpencive. But think of Driver revisions. It is easier to get driver kits from Apple than from every other manufacturer 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The IIvx...LCIII performance at a Centris 610 price. The only reason to get an IIvx is if you really need the full-size Nubus slots. Keep in mind that the 610 supports all Apple monitors and has optional Ethernet. This lessens (but doesn't eliminate) the need for Nubus cards. And unless you're running FPU-intensive software, the 610 will blow the doors off the LCIII and the IIvx. The LCIII, on the other hand, is sufficient for most people and has a great price. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Does anyone know who makes a cable or adapter that is wired according to Apple's specs that forces the external output on LC's and the Powerbook's 160/180 and Duo 230 into a true VGA style output signal? The NEC Adapter does not do this since their monitors are multisync they just route the signal into the correct pinout but do not switch the Macs output into VGA mode. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I've noticed some of you mentioning owning a Quadra 800 8/230 with CD300 and 1meg of VRAM. It seems that this configuration was purchased complete; that is, the CD300 and VRAM were already installed in the box. I am interested in that exact configuration and will be buying with an educational discount but have not found the CD300 bundled with any Q800 smaller than the 8/500. If you bought or know how to buy the 8/230 with CD installed, please let me know what you know via email: send messages to dmaluso@mhc.mtholyoke.edu Thanks, all. Diane Maluso 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I have to increase the memory in a Plus or SE (I'm not sure which since I haven't seen it yet). I did this a few years ago but I no longer have the instructions. I forget which resistor needs to be cut to go from 1 to 4 Mbs. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I have a Radius Precision Color 24x video card for the Mac that fits in a NuBus slot. The card has 3 Mb of VRAM on it, which means that 24-bit color is possible on the card! The card supports just about any monitor scan rate you can think of (I used it at 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768, but it can go higher). You can switch resolutions and depth on the fly with a software control panel. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 So far I have only seen pictures of the new ergonomic keyboard, but it seems that the 'b' is placed on the left part after the split. However, when I learned typing in school some years ago, I was taught to write 'b' with my right hand. Is this a difference between Danish and American typing, or what??? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I've got the official word on the LaserWriter Pro 600 memory" 'upgrade. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 From the benchmarks I've seen (was that in MacUser or MacWeek?) the FPU-less Centris 610 is _faster_ at floating-point operations (the kind of calculations that get routed to an FPU) than a Mac IIfx! 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I have used both my serial ports with a modem and a serial printer, so I cannot use Appletalk. Is there a Ethernet to Localtalk hardware that will let me use the Ethernet port on my Q700 as a Localtalk port. Until they come out with satellite dishes that sit on your window & give you internet access from your home, I won't at all be using that port. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Because SCSI works well with removable media, and works well with large capacity devices. The floppy interface you suggest handles the former, but it doesn't have any hooks for dealing with the latter... you'd have to kludge it. Plus, it's extremely low performance. AND, SCSI has gobs of room for expansion compared with a floppy (I can just see it, let's stick a 5.25", a 3.5", a tape drive, and a MO drive, all on the floppy interface. The possibilities for unexpected collisions are enormous). 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Well, I just got my Centris 610 yesterday. It took just over two weeks from placing the order. The dealer (Rutgers computer store) appologized because Apple made a substitution on my order. I ordered the one without ethernet, but they substituted one _with_ ethernet. He wanted to know if that would be "alright with me"!!! They must be backlogged on Centri w/out ethernet so they're just shipping them with! 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 You must not have tried very hard. I just opend mine in about 2 seconds. Take a look on the bottom, it has a dial that turns to open much like the older ADB mouses used to have. It's a bit harder to turn at first but it is quite simple to open. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Check out the May issue of MacWorld; the new servers are on the cover. Should be at your favorite newstand. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Nope. The Apple 16" monitor does not support multiple resolutions. It is not a multi-synching monitor. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 What phony names? My name is clearly visible in the headers, and I sing the post with my account name. If you have a problem with that, then you will have to get over it. I've used this account name for over 10 years and the people who have been reading newsgroups for the last 7 generally recognize "Hades" as my account name. I have no intention of changing the way I post. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I am looking for any information about the Sigma Designs double up board. All I can figure out is that it is a hardware compression board that works with AutoDoubler, but I am not sure about this. Also how much would one cost? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Alain: Get your facts straight before you post something like this. The Duo Dock does not have a CPU of its own. It is a docking station with ports connecting various components, including the portable PowerBook with its own CPU. I guess these rumored new Duo Docks have a built-in CPU to perform functions of their own. Interesting! If they're not compatible with the current Duo models, I think you'll be hearing a lot more "screwed by Apple" complaints. Imagine a company obsoleting (ooh, a new verb!) a virtually brand new computer... sheesh... 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 It must be... ...I type it with my left hand. Personally, I would have a real problem with my keyboard opened up like that, because I tend to share some keys with both hands, particularly if I'm doing something else with one hand (like using the cursor keys, mouse, or glass of Jolt). 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I thought NEC and Toshiba CD-ROM mechanism have an average access time of less than 200 ms. While the SONY-APPLE CD-ROM drive has an access time of 300 ms for the doublespin models. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Do you need to get a ROM upgrade to use a 1.4 Mb floppy drive with a Mac II? Or are there 3rd party drives which work with the Mac II's own ROMs? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I can only comment on thermal recalibration in general. Some new drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data writes. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical tolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some* track drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This becomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and so was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of boosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I'm interested in getting an external hard drive for my SE/30. I've got an internal 40MB that's pretty full, even with compression s/w. Alot of people talk about $/MB, what's a good ratio? I'm thinking of adding either an 80 or a 100 (or 105). What brands would people suggest? Finally, places to buy from? Are more popular mail-order places better to order from or the places that JUST sell hard drives (e.g. ones that advertise in the back of MacWorld and MacUser). 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I am going to be getting a C650 soon, but I don;t want Apple to come out with the Cyclones and the Tempest in a month and have the price drop on the system I want. I have negotiated a good deal with a supplier for a C650 8/80 and I would like to jump on it, but, again, I don't want the price drop to smuther me. BTW, the deal I have is a C650 8/80 with mouse for $2295... does anyone know of a better deal? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Well, I saw a few posts on this and asumed that everyone is talking about the new 14" display... mine does it to... kinda like when I would degauss my old 13", and since the new one lacks this button, I assume that is what it is doing... anyone that knows I'd appreciate the info, but it doesn't worry me... 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Well, although this may be an uncommon occurrence (or not) I had a "bad" experience with TechWorks. This past summer I upgraded (increased) the memory in a powerbook and a ci. When I called to place the order for the PB RAM, I was told by the sales person that they would give me a $50 rebate if I would return the original RAM (which was also TechWorks RAM.) I followed the instructions for returning the old RAM, expecting to see a credit on my VISA within a few weeks. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Does anyone have any experience using LCIII with MIDI? Do they get along OK? I have heard that the IIvx is not suitable for MIDI, but I have not heard anyon e say anything definitive about LCIII and MIDI? If you have had experience, wh at MIDI interface have you used? Anyone used Finale software in this setting? Please e-mail. I will summarize. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I've had the board for over a year, and it does work with Diskdoubler, but not with Autodoubler, due to a licensing problem with Stac Technologies, the owners of the board's compression technology. (I'm writing this from memory; I've lost the reference. Please correct me if I'm wrong.) 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Is that the low-end configuration? If it is, it has the 68LC040 (no FPU), as opposed to all the other configurations with a 68RC040 (has an FPU). Be sure you know what you are getting before you buy!!! The 68RC040 is around $350-$400 right now, if you intend to upgrade it from a 68LC040. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I'm having a real tough time finding out the proper adapters to use a VGA monitor (an IBM 8513 sold w/ many PS/2's to be exact) on the Mac LC III. All of the vendors I have called say that the internal video will not work on a true VGA monitor but will work on a IBM Compatible multisync like the sony's or the NEC monitors. I thought the VGA capability of LCIII was very attractive because it allowed you to use inexpensive VGA monitors. Am I confused or are these vendors just not up to speed? Has anyone used an LCIII with a non multisync VGA monitor and if so where did you get your adapter (please be specific w/ vendor and cat #)? I would prefer to get a apple monitor for these LCIII's (it's unseemly to see the finder inside an IBM bezel) but the more money we save on monitors the more LCIII's we can afford and the more PS/2's we can get rid of! 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Tell that to the Japanese, their local market is neatly protected by the Japanese government. Its one very tough nut to crack. In fact the only current way to break into it, is to do it with a Japanese company as a partner in the venture.

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I recently aquired a Quantum Q250 harddisk. It is a 50 meg 5.25" mechanism. It is SCSI. I have a few questions and a few problems. First there seems to be an extra connector socket on the back that I can't figure out what it is for. The address is set by some jumpers on the bottom so I don't think it is for that. Any ideas? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Please, I beg you. If you know anything about the Caere Typist Plus Graphics Hand Scanner, Please read and solve my problem. I will be truely grateful for the rest of my life! 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 reconditioned at a discounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still covered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I can't even hear the fan on my 650.....gee I wonder if its working.....yup, just checked, its exhausting air out the back just fine. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I don't know how to say it best but you are gaurenteed that the price of the C650 is going to drop this year. This week's MacWeek reports that Apple is probably planning a drop in August. My guess is that it may come sooner if Apple decides to change the price structure upon release of the multimedia units this summer. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Max thruput on a Centris or Quadra is about 3.3 MB/sec. Max thruput on IIci or IIfx or equivalent is about 1.4 MB/Sec Max thruput on slower machines is slower. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I need to get an Apple 40SC tape backup unit working under Sys 7.0.x, but do not have any drivers/software to access the device. Does anyone know where I can fidn the tools to access this device? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Has anyone tried or does anyone know if this procedure will work on an SE/30? Mine's old, slow, and in need of either death or power. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 You should be able to pick up an ADB cable at any computer wiring store... I'd give you the address of Alberta Computer cable in Calgary, but a: I'm in Victoria (B.C., Canada) and b: I don't think an address in Calgary would help you too much....basically however I just phoned them up, and they charged me approx. $15 cnd for a custom made ADB extension cable for my mouse. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I have the a CD-Technology drive with the Toshiba mechanism, and it is supposedly the fast and best now. It has an access of 200ms and a data transfer rate 300Kb/sec. It is multisession photo-cd compatible. It is available from educorp for $599, the CD-Technology one, and comes with two mail in coupons for two free CDs. I'm not sure if the cd's are good, since I've only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd's shipped to my home address in california instead of here in maryland. The CD-technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive, which supposedly gives it a longer life, and keeps it cleaner with no fan to attract dust. A Toshiba brand drive is also available, but I think the CD-Technology is better, since you get the same mechanism, and at a slightly lower price with two free CDs. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE CAERE TYPIST PLUS GRAPHICS HAND SCANNER, PLEASE READ ON AND SAVE MY LIFE......... 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I want to achieve an overall throughput rate of around 5 megabytes / sec for very large data transfers. (Around 5 MB.) 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 1. Why, or how actually, can a Powerbook have a 640 x 400 pixel display, regardless if it is a 9" or 10", and still keep the 72 dpi resolution? (I assume that it doesn't, and I don't mean to imply they *all* have these dimensions) 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Of course its possible, I get 1024x768 on my Centris 650. All you need is a correctly wired video cable. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 By rotating the plate around the mouse ball counter-clockwise you can open the mouse and clean it. It isn't as obvious as the Desktop Bus Mouse I but it opens quite easily once you see what has to be done. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 It would also be great for another reason - when not docked, it could serve as an ARA server to the large internal HD, your corporate email, etc. In a pinch, you would also have two machines, instead of 1.5. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I also use Retrospect, but I noticed that Central Point Software's "MacTools Backup" also supports the Apple tape drive under 7.x. The Apple tape drive is quite slow, so the advantages of Retrospect relative to the simpler MacTools Backup are less significant than might be the case for someone backing up a large server to a DAT drive. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Also, has anyone heard any rumors that the new docks (the ones with the CPU :-) will be better designed that this first batch? I love my Duo, but installing cards in the dock is not much fun. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Apples HDSC will only format a hard drive that Apple sold. You need to use a third party formater like Drive7 or SpotOn. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The Toshiba has a 200ms access time, the NEC has a 280ms access time, right around the Sony/Apple. Access time is, of course, somewhat important, but not as vital in the case of CDs as data transfer rate. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I think the original poster meant opening the mouse, not just releasing the ball and getting to the rollers. I found that on the original ADB mouse, sometimes unscrewing the two halves allowed for easier cleaning. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I just got a Quadra 800 8/230 and I've noticed that I can't change the desktop color from the beautiful gray. I thought maybe I should reinstall the OS using the "Install Me First, Macintosh Centris, Quadra..." diskette because the system file on this diskette is more recent than the one on the hard disk. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Here's a question that may be simple enough to answer, but has stumped myself and a few others: 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Hello all. I am thinking about buying an external monitor for my SE/30 and was wondering if anyone out in netland has any advice for me. I am mostly thinking about a 14" color monitor and an 8 bit card that can switch between 640*480 and something higher (like 800*600). I read an old report on a card from Lapis that could do this, but could not use the external monitor as the main screen (with menubar) which to me is a major draw- back. Has this perhaps been fixed? Or can any other cards do this (like the Micron Xceed) ? Also which monitor should I buy? At the moment I am leaning towards the Sony 1304, 1304s or 1320 (what exactly is the difference between these?) but are there any other good cheap monitors I should know about? Doesn't the monitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I believe that in order to get at the innards of the new mouse, you must remove the label on the bottom that says "Apple Desktop Bus Mouse II" There you should find two screws on either side. I haven't tried it myself yet, but when I ran my fingernail accross the label, these two divots appeared, and I can only assume that these are the elusive screws in question. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Just thought I would mention that Sony no longer manufactures the CPD- 1304 because of several manufacturing flaws. The new model is now the 1430, which just like Apple's new Sony Trinitrom CLAIMS to be 14 inches. I'm not sure of the details on the defects, but I work at our schools bookstore and can tell you that nearly half of them were returned with some kind of defect or another. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I'm assuming that you are referring to the 1304S, correct? What kind of flaws have been reported? I've been using mine for about 6-7 months now, and I haven't noticed any problems. Might they develop later, or did I get lucky and snag a good monitor? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 with the original grayscale OneScanner and were very pleased. Is the color model comparable in quality? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I also returned PB memory last summer for credit, and the sales person warned me not to use US mail. I did (although I did insure the shipment), and apparently Techworks got it. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I would like to know what people's opinions are about the "real world" differences are between a C650 with and without a coprocessor... 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Nope. I'm pretty sure that this person knows how to take the ball out. I think that what they want to do is take the mouse apart. The old mouse had four screws on the bottom that you could unscrew to do this, while there's no obvious way to take the new one apart. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Hi, I have been getting a lot of requests for this information so I thought I would post it for those interested parties. (Sorry for length). 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I've got a Racet 5.25" MO Drive with a Ricoh RO-5030E mechanism with the new ROMs... The thing is, I have a new TOSOH Optical Disk 512/bytes per sector cart for the thing that refuses to mount or be formatted... all the carts that I have for the drive that work are Racet Certified Media 512k/sector carts... All I can think of is that this TOSOH cart uses some kind of incompatible low level format... anyone know what software will allow this to be formatted on this drive? or a new DIP setting for the mechanism? I've tried just about every combination of drivers and custom formatting programs I can find with no luck... any ideas? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The PowerBook 170 4/40 with Fax/Data modem is available thru CitiBank's CitiDollars catalog for $1995.00 + $19.95 S/H (+ 500 CitiDollars). 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Flopticals have been available since the beginning of the year at $25 per floptical (= $1.20 per megabyte), and I have seen them advertised in MacWEEK at $20 (< $1.00 per megabyte). For someone on a tight budget, the fact that the minimal dollar increment for more storage is less---$25 versus $60---sometimes matters. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 We have recently obtained a Centris 610 and it has developed an unusual video problem. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 There's this old SE here. It's got the older-style fans that remind me of a house-ventilator. A cylindrical drum instead of the bladed rotor I usually see. Anyway, the SE makes this loud buzzing noise due to vibration somewheres. If I remove the screws and loosen the front from the back, it quiets down. I can only assume that the fan housing from this goofy thing is touching the back of the case and vibrating against it. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 If anyone has any information about the upcoming new computers (Cyclone and Tempest), I am in need of some info. Anything would be greatly appreciated. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt!! Sorry -- wrong. It would be an extremely hot idea...at least with the current Alphas. The available Alphas run up to 200 MHz. But they produce quite a bit of heat. In fact so much that they need special mounting with extra large heat sinks. Also Apple looks pretty commited to the PowerPC route instead of a deal with DEC. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I have a chance to buy a used PS/2 Appletalk card to create a network with my home machines. However, the guy who has the card tells me there's a DB-9 or DB-15 (can't remember now) on the back of the card, rather than the 8-pin (or 4-pin) mini-din that I expect. This sounds more like a Thicknet ethernet card. Should there be a transciever on it, like on the Quadras? What would be a reasonable price to expect to pay for one of these cards, keeping in mind that it's Micro-Channel Architecture, which means take your best guess and double it. Email replies would be appreciated, to here or to rrr@ideas.com Thanks. [RICHR] 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 We have a Quadra 700 with 170MB HD, but need to a lot of sound sampling for auditory research. What would be the best type of removable media for storing these audio clips? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The 3FGx has a maximum horizontal scan rate of 49KHz, so driving it at 60.24KHz to get 1024 x 768 on the Mac is WAY BEYOND the tolerance The 4FG is spec'ed at 57KHz, so going 60.24KHz is only 5-6% above the minimally guaranteed figure. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 About this QUADRA 700, 800 clock acceleration: has anyone heard of anything like it for the QUADRA 950? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 the : reboot button were being pushed. Sometimes the Mac is able to fully boot : and display the desktop, but it is only a matter of time before it reboots : again. At times, the frequency is as high as several times a minute. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I just read an article on the SWII. One thing puzzles me: the article says the SWII is a serial-only device. Does that mean I'll have to unplug my modem each time I want to print something??? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 would there be any problems with hooking up a Toshiba 3401 external CD-ROM drive to a 700? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I have noticed this exact same phenomenon occurs with my LCIII. Perhaps it is a quirk of the new machines? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Any new reports about iisi clock upgrade to 25 mhz, 33 mhz? Any failures? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Yes, but if you upgrade the VRAM in a 900 you get 24 bit color. So you really don't care. My point is that out the box the 950 has more video capability for the same size monitors. The 900 can do 24 bit with both 13" and 16", doesn't support 19", and does 8 bit on 21" monitors. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 So patch the ROMs with the latest OS version. I don't see how this is a problem. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Sorry, I assumed that the the various new machines with the internal CD-ROM bay worked the same as the Quadra 900. Obviously they don't. I can use any of three inputs by changing the radio button under the sound cp on my Quadra 900, Microphone, External, and CD-ROM. I always leave the microphone plugged in (even though I never use it). 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Complete Q700 are best obtained from your dealer or some recent copy of MacWorld or MacUser. My foggy memory suggests that the most relevant comparison factors vis-a-vis a IIci are as follows: 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Sorry about the misinformation. I made a bad assumption about the new machines behaving like a Quadra 900, see previous post. About sampling the CD audio though, have you tried it? I found the aliasing to be really bad. Like it needed a filter or something. Much worse than I expected. I installed the CD-300 in the Quadra myself so maybe I missed something. Everything else works great though. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I bought a Bernoulli 90pro drive last year after comparing it with lots of diffrent storage solutions, OPTICAL drives are SLOW, very slow compared to 13 to 19ms access of Bernoulli. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I am looking for one of those color LCD screens you place on an overhead projector and control the presentation with a Mac. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 It would depend on the requirements of the poster's data, for some purposes 1/256 resolution (with or without calibration curve). 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 A quick query for Powerbook gurus: Tom Spearman, in a post on alternative Powerbook battery options mentioned that there exist 3 versions of their Powerbook 140-180 batteries: a 2.5 amp hour one (M5545/A), a 2.8 amp hour one, (M5545/B) and a 2.9 amp hour one (M5545/C). Anyone out there know how to determine which of these a battery is? I looked at my battery and there is no obvious exterior indication. I contacted Tom Spearman who had gleaned the information from MacUser and he didn't know either. Anyone out there know the answer?" 'Thanks! Christopher Majka nextug@ac.dal.ca

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Excuse me if this is a frequent question, I checked in several FAQs but couldn't really find anything. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Hi There, I am trying to find out a reliable Power Center, it is basically a surge protector that sits below the monitor and has individual control for each outlet. Some people have an opinion that none of them work well. The ones that I could locate in Microcenter catalogue were: 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I recently purchased a Centris 610 and am having difficulty getting my computer to recognize my hard disk drive (external) Using both the disk uitily of TMS (Diskwriter) and Jasmine's software, neither one will show the drive. The drive is the only device connected to the scuzzi port. I cant find the manual to the tms pro 120 and seem to remember that it is "terminated". Is there something else that I am doing (or not doing) that does not allow my 610 to recognize my external disk drive?. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I would be very wary of retail outlets selling as cheap as educational prices! I went for a retailer, actually mail order (CDA computers), because its price was better thant the campus computer store. I found out why later on when I tried to get a repair done at an Apple registered repair center - the CPU was a resale. The serial number had been removed and replaced with a non-standard number (probably from CDA computers). Consequently, the Apple repair man could not do ANY warrenty repairs. So I ended up with just a 90day warrenty from CDA over the Apple 12month warrenty. Boy, was I pi**ed! Moral of the story, CAVEAT EMPTOR. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I too am interested in peoples' experience with accelerators for the SE. Is an accelerator the best route to improve performace in my SE, or should I consider upgrading to an SE/30 motherboard? Obviously, buying a new mac would be ideal, but alas, I only have enough money for an accelerator or motherboard. E-mail reply preferred. Thanks. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Hi all: Does anyone know where I can get the cheapest price for the Teleport Gold fax modem by Global Village? Any answer will be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The trackbal on my PB140 no longer moves in the horizontal direction. When I called the nearest Authorized Apple Service person I was told that it probably needed replacing and that would cost me over $150! Ouch! Can anyone recommend a less expensive way to fix this problem? One strange symptom of the problem is that when I take the ball out of the socket and shine a light into the hole I can make the cursor move horizontally by moving the wheel with my finger, it works fine that way but won't work if I turn off the light. Any suggestions or comments? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 the HIGH VOLTAGE CAPASITOR. Apple knows about this problem and is replacing the cap at no cost if it falls into the bad batch that they got from their supplier. Your local repair shop should know about REPAIR EXTENSION 3L0218. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 My MacClassic mouse died. I dissected it and determined that it is the microswitch, that senses the click, that is stuck in the depressed mode. This tragedy prompts the following questions: 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I have just been introduced to Macintosh systems. I have a few questions. E-mail prefered. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I hear that the Performa 450 is really an LCIII with an internal modem. Can the modem part be obtained and installed in an LCIII? It would be nice if it were actually a powerbook internal modem, but that might be too much to hope for. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I've had a couple of e-mail responses from people who seem to believe that this sort of thing is not only unsupported, it is downright dangerous. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 FWIW, I work for FOCUS Enhancements, and a lot of the people we sell our EtherLAN SC/SC-T (our SCSI Ethernet interface) are disgruntled EN/SC users. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 the keyboard and mouse and plug them in again without turning the power off, the mouse suddenly switches to about half its normal movement speed. I check the "Mouse" control panel, and there's no change in its setting there--it's still on full speed, the way I like it. Restarting the machine restores the normal mouse speed. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Could someone tell me how to make/find/get the best frontplate for IIvi/IIvx/C650 with internal SyQuest drive? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 A friend of mine has problems running Spigot LC on an LC III. His configuration is: 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 of course it was in Dale's post, just not in the words that MacUser used. ROM accelerated video just means that some quickdraw commands has been rewritten (inside the ROM) to take advantage of the 68040 addressing modes. commands that do fills should be slightly faster since the new instructions fetch 2 bytes at a time versus one. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 THere is a defect in the 13" hi-res monitors, bring it to a dealer and they will replace the flyback for free, I think. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 What do I need to do to be able to run an NEC 3FGx in 800x 600 mode on my IIci? Can it be done with the right video card? If so, which video card? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 A professor of mine once said "The difference between a Computer Engineer and a Computer Scientist is about $5000" meaning the Engineer makes $5000 more than the CS. Seriously though the main difference is that most CS people write programs that people will use, i.e. database, graphics, word processors, etc., while an engineer writes for machines or control systems, i.e. the "computer" in your car, a flight control system, computer controled devices, etc. In other words CS writes SOFTWARE while CSE writes FIRMWARE. These are generalizations but for the most part that is what the difference is. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 1. The Mac II is supposed to have a socket for the MC68851 PMMU chip. Could anyone let me know where that socket is on the motherboard. I have obtained a PMMU chip (16 Mhz) from a surplus store, and would like to install it onto my Mac II (circa 1987). But I cannot see the socket myself when I tried to install it. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The service notice on the 13" hi-res monitors expired 3/23/93 after this date Apple will NOT reimburse service providers for the fix (replacement of the hi-voltage capacitor). All you folks that have been putting up with intermittant shutdowns without getting it to your service provider missed out on the freebie. It was in force for a year. If you got it free after 3/23, you got a deal... Jeff Hite Computing Center U of Oregon jeffh@ludwig.cc.uoregon.edu 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Yea, thanks to lots of good information in this newsgroup, I was prepared for lots of details (even shipping time ... got my C610 8/230/CD in 5 weeks). I guess my biggest disappointment is the lack of detail in the written specs and documentation. The case load spec is an example -- the setup section says Apple 14" and 16" monitors can go on top, but 21" and other big ones can't. Why couldn't they publish a maximum load? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I'd appreciate it greatly if someone could E-mail me the following: (if you only know one, that's fine) 1) Specs for the 68040 (esp. how it compares to the Pentium) 2) Specs for the 68060 with estimated cost, release date, etc... 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Does anyone have details on this? What sort of FP errors is the Q900 sensitive to? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Terry, hi. I recently bought an LCIII and a Datadesk 101E. I can't remember trying to rebuild the desktop with it, however it did give me a strange problem. When I held down shift during startup to disable all extensions, nothing happened. I tried it with another keyboard, using the same adb connector cable- and it worked with the other keyboard. The shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise. I checked the dipswitches and they are fine. Try disabling your extensions and tell me if it works. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I am resending this message because my news program may have goofed the first time. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Apple does not authorise sales through Mail Order. As a result mail order companies have to obtain their machines by the grey market. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The little blue roller on the trackball interior is probably rubbing against its support, just push it down the pin so that it no longer touches it. I had a similar problem. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Of course, if you want to check the honesty of your dealler, take it in knowing what's wrong, and ask them to tell you. :) 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Hi. I own an LCIII and I recently heard an interesting rumor. I heard that the LCIII has a built in slot for a PowerPC chip. Is this true? I heard that the slot is not the same as the PDS slot. Is that true? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I just recently purchased the GCC BLP Elite and I really like it. My needs are much the same as what you describe. In addition, I wanted to get one that I could access via AppleTalk, so that eliminated the new line of inexpensive printers from Apple. The print quality is good to excellent based on what font you're using and what paper you use. I'm still experimenting with different papers, but a medium grade laser printer paper seems to work fine. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 An added advantate of waiting for the DayStar for the SE/30 is that, just as with the '030 power cache, the '040 accelerator will plug into the CPU socket, leaving the PDS slot free for a video card or ethernet card. With DayStar's upgrade path, it's a no lose situation. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 No, he's not missing anything. You're right that some models of the 650 ship in the USA without FPU or Ethernet. Per Ejeklint is also right -- *all*, I repeat, *ALL* Centris 650's sold here in New Zealand and, I assume, Europe have the FPU and Ethernet. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I've just completed a successful upgrade of a an SI to 27.5 mhz. I'm waiting on delivery of a 62 mhz clock for a final speed trial. Definitely needed the heatsink. The CPU was quite hot to the touch at higher speeds until I glued on a 90 cent Radio Shack sink. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 It clearly depends on the type of questions you are asking but in many cases it will do fine. The critical information from the neuron is in the firing frequency (maximum about 100 action potentials per seconds), and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the signal shape. So the resolution of about 0.4 % you get with an 8 bit convertor is more then sufficient. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 No. Plug the printer in the printer port, and the modem in the modem port. ;) 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I do not have this type of problem, but at one point an Apple rep told me that Duo's "System Enabler" file version 1.0.1 fixes some kind of sleep-related problem. You may want to investigate this... 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 each time I want to print something??? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Noooooooo! I've been servicing Macs for years too, and I've had to repair a number of motherboards that had been damaged this way. It's rare, but it does happen. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Seth I fail to see any advantage whatsoever with this kind of set-up. Seth What a DUMB idea. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 A few days ago, my powerbook starts to freeze after appr. 18 seconds of inactivity. It stays alive as long as a program is actively running or as long as the mouse is moved. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I'm thinking about upgrading my 030 50MHz to the 040 33version. Has anyone had any experience with the accelerator, and if so - what do you think? Any problems, what are the speedometer results?, is it much faster than the 50MHz? Basically, I'd appreciate hearing all about this product. Please respond via email, and I'll summarize if there's a big response. thanks in advance, Andrew 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 OTOH, some of us get lucky-- I've unplugged and replugged SCSI and ADB quite often, and never blown anything. I blew out the ADB by shorting the cable, though. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I am seeking recommendations/Vendors for a Networkable FAX. It would mainly be used for outgoing FAX's from Mac's on our Net. The ability to Fax from other platforms would be a plus. Ethernet interface would be preffered but LocalTalk would suffice. Can anyone provide any info? Thanks in advance, --Peter 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Okay, I don't use it very much, but I would like for it to keep working correctly, at least as long as Apple continues to make System software that will run on it, if slowly :-) 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I would like to know if a Performa Plus monitor is compatible with Apple 14in Color Display, or it is just a VGA moniro. Any help will be appreciate. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Here's a good one: Does anyone know of a product that allows me to RACK MOUNT my 2CI (or maybe 650 if I blow some more money...) ??? My application is music, and would like to be able to haul it around (would probably plan to get an MO drive or something so I don't have to depend on an internal fixed hard drive - i.e., may be pretty rough on an internal HD...) 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Mysstem crashes aftwer sleepp. I use 1.0.1 enabler. I use appletalk and filesharing. I have and ExpressModem. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The third-party media adapters are usually cheaper (at least in Toronto) than Apple's. I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I recall reading that the Mac LC (and presumably the LC II & III) can use stand ard VGA monitors, with appropriate cable adapters. I am uncertain of this sinc e I have asked other people who say this is not so. So can all vga monitors be used on the Mac LC? What are the specs needed for a PC monitor to work with a Mac LC (horizontal nad vertical frequencies)? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 For a good display, you *must* get an active matrix panel and a *very* bright overhead projector designed to be used with an LCD panel (i.e. stage must not get too hot). I tried out a Proxima Ovation unit and liked it, but I needed a brighter projector (I used it with a 3M 920). It is also too expensive for what you get, IMHO. Prices of active matrix panels are rumoured to drop substantially sometime this year (something to do with tarrifs being lifted I think). 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I notice the Toshiba 3401 has 3 versions, B - internal, E - external and P - portable. Can anyone tell me the difference between the portable and the external version? Where in the SF Bay Area can I find a model P? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I have an old Mac Plus. A couple of years ago I bought a shiney new lc. It came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with a mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you very much). 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Does anyone know where I can still get an internal fax modem for the original mac portable? I know they were made for a while by several manufacturers, but I can't find them now. thanks for your help. Gene Wright 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I just recently bought a 4 MB ram card for my original mac portable (backlit) and have since had some bizarre crashes. It happens when I put the machine to sleep and wake the machine up. sometimes it will just freeze the cursor and lock the machine up forcing me to push the reset switch. Other times it will give me the usual bomb box with the error message of "Co processor not installed". 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I am in need of the Driver for the Bernoulli Cartridge on a DataFrame XP60+B. The hard disk on the system got fried and I haven't been able to locate the original disks. If anyone has it or know where I can get this please let me know via e-mail. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 With a little luck, I could own a C650 sometime in the near future, and so I was just wondering if someone could clear these two questions up for me: 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 wouldany one know afair price for an LC Color card in Aussie dollars?? just wondering... 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Yes! what you are saying is absolutey true, but what you fail to mention is the fact that the LCIII uses the new 72 pin simms which allow 32 bit access to each simm. In the case of the LC III, it only has one simm slot, but accesses will be 32 bits wides. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The problem is that the pins in the ADB connector are close to each other, and if you happen to bend the cable a little while inserting it, you short the ADB port. If you take it to an Apple Repair Centre, that means a new motherboard (though a component replace IS physically possible) 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I haven't seen much info about how to add an extra internal disk to a mac. We would like to try it, and I wonder if someone had some good advice. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I am in the market for a 120M hard drive! I have a IIsi with 5/80 and I am almost all filled up! Is anyone selling any HD's for the Mac for cheap? Where can I get one through mail order and where is the best place to buy from for the best prices? Is there anyone on the net or on this newsgroup that sells them for wholesale or cheaper? Any info would be appreciated! Thanks! 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I own a Mac IIsi and am considering upgrades (cards, hard drive, etc). Can you tell me what the power limitations are for 1) the PDS slot and 2) the hard drive power feed. Secondly, Can you tell me if there is a separate limit for each, or if instead, there is a single limit for both combined? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 This doesn't sound right to me. Don't Quadras use the 53C96? If so, the Mac has nothing to do with the SCSI timing. That's all handled by the chip. About the only the timing could be wrong is if Apple programs the clock registers wrong on the 96. That, however, should only really hurt synchronous transfer, which is not used by the Mac SCSI Manager. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The internal HD in my LC disappeared for a day last week, and I'd like to hear any (reasonable) theories folks can suggest for what happened. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Could someone please do one of the following: 1. Point to an init that allows me to turn off power management on my Duo 210. 1. Write an init that would allow me to turn off ALL power management on Duo 210. 2. Point me to documentation on power management so that I can write such an init. 3. Explain to me why such an init is totally or partially impossible. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 What kind of post is this? If you have something substantial to tell the world, then at least give us details! So what if they are coming out with new Macs, they always do that... what's new about these models? Etc... 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 My Datadesk Mac 101E keyboard has similar problems. I have found that holding down the RIGHT-HAND shift key at startup will work (disable extensions), but the left-hand shift key won't (which is unfortunate, since the left one is the one I instinctively reach for). 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 You are excused... the answer varies from Mac to Mac so it would be a complex answer in the FAQ. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I had the same question for my 55lb NEC 5FG monitor. The Apple guy said that their 50lb 16" monitor is OK to put ontop of the Centris and had no coment beyond that. I was going to just put the NEC on the box but then I got to thinking - the monitor has a small tilt/swivel base so maybe the weight would be more concentrated than with Apple's (I don't know the area of the base of their tilt/swivel). Additionally, the CDROM drive is in the middle. So I cut a piece of 3/8" thick wood to about 16.25" x 12", covered it in a cream covered cloth, and used it as a buffer layer between the Centris's top and the monitor!! 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The magnet trick will work. Be careful when you apply the white tape to the rubber carriage roller, it tells the scanner where the edge is and it can come off. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 it can not completely compensate for the gravitational pull in a vertical position. I'm not saying that your hard disk will fail tomorrow or 6 months from now, but why take that chance? If you want more detailed info on the problem, please mail me at:=== sunnyt@dna.bchs.uh.edu <===. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I currently use an HP DeskJet with Grappler LS ver 1.0, and it works on System7. Course, I only use the SWA Dutch and SWA Swiss fonts that came with it, due to the 4x size requirement to print to the HP. (ie: must have 40pnt definition to print a 10pnt font) When I upgraded, I talked to Orange Micro, and they state that ver 1.2 of Grappler LS definitely works with System7. However, the upgrade was US$40, so I passed. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I don't know about the specific problem mentioned in your message, but I definitely had SCSI problems between my Q700 and my venerable Jasmine Megadrive 10 cartridge drives. My solution was to get Silverlining. None of the loops that involved blind writes worked to the drives; in fact the only loop that worked was the "Macintosh Software" loop (whatever that means). 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I doubt this is a Quadra-specific problem. I had to get rid of my "venerable" Bernoulli 20 last year (with enough cartridges purchased at ~$90 each to make the whole thing worth more than my whole computer ;). The tech support guys at Ocean Microsystems suggested that some third-party drivers might fix the problem - in my case the cartridges wouldn't format/mount/partition for A/UX. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The original Mac II had an Apple MMU chip installed which performs a subset of the 68851's functions. If you look underneath your front left floppy bay you will find three chips, all approximately the same size. One will be the 68020, the next the 68881, and the third, approximately the same size, will be the Apple chip. It is easy to spot because it has a 'hump' in the middle of it. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Officially, no. From experience (yours now included!), yes. Quantums seem to be the most problem-free brand on the Mac. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 When I owned an SE, I replaced the fan with SE Silencer, available, I believe, from MacWarehouse or MacConnection. It comes with instruction for installation and requires no soldering. Worked like a charm. I think the manufacturer is Mobius. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Yes. That is exactly what it means. The LC family of Macs can only use PDS cards. They are not able to use NuBus. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I tried the right set and it didn't work. I'm on the phone to their tech support right now and the guys doesn't know what a desktop rebuild is!!! He's got me holding for someone else............... And holding, and holding, and holding. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 is it possible to fit an FPU in a mac SE? (not a SE/30, but the plain old SE); if possible, would I get any speed increase? what would be the reference of the chip? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 According to the (seen several times) postings from Dale Adams of Apple Computer, both the 610 and the 650 require 80ns SIMMS - NOT 60 ns. Only the Centris 800 requires 60 ns SIMMs. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The Partition button in Apple's HD Setup lets you set up A/UX and other types of partitions. It WON'T let you create more than one normal mac volume. You need SilverLining or something similar to do that. It WILL, however, allow you to take advantage of some possible unused space on your hard disk, if you don't mind reformatting the whole thing. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I believe you were misinformed. I checked out one of the P450's at Sears last week. The modem is external 2400bps data with send-only FAX. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Try MaxAppleZoom ( a shareware init ) if your monitor is not driven by internal video. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I think all Powerbooks use the same 2 Meg upgrade, but the 4 Meg and 6 Meg upgrades are different for the PB100 than for the other PBs. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 What conclusion can be drawn from this? I'm trying to figure out what kind of memory configuration for the LC III (32-bit datapath) would be fastest. Any ideas? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Anyone seen any press releases or heard any rumors of a cache card for the LCIII, now that it has the full data bus width on the PDS slot? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Hi... what alternatives to the Express modem do Duo owners have (if they want to go at least 9600 baud)? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 That's fine, but would you name the "industy experts" so I can try to track this down? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Apple doesn't make such a card, though I suppose a third party could. One big problem is that there isn't room for a standard NuBus card inside the LC III. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The audio will simply select the CD audio when the microphone is removed. I don't believe the button un-dims, since there's nothing to select. I haven't tracked down a Centris to check this on though. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I'm sure Intel and Motorola are competing neck-and-neck for crunch-power, but for a given clock speed, how do we rank the following (from 1st to 6th): 486tt68040 386tt68030 286tt68020 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I like it a lot. It is worth the additional expense. The only problem I found is with MS Word (5.1a). If you have a table the is longer than a page and the cells have a visible border, the last (bottom of page) line on the first page will be missing. It makes no difference how the table is formatted. The worst is that it doesn't show up in word's page view or page preview. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Dynamic RAM is not based on flip-flops; there's basically a single transistor and capacitor to store each bit! Static RAM is based on flip-flops, and is much more expensive and much less dense. And neither has any parts that "move", if electrons and thermal expansion are ignored... 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 long term data storage of opticals. And the last time I looked, floptical disk weren't all that cheap, ($30 per floptical disk = $1.40 per megabyte, $60 per sysquest is $1.36 per megabyte). 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I have a new 25 MHz Motorola 68040 that I am willing to sell if I get a good enough offer. It is still in its static free sealed package. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I have an old Mac Plus. A couple of years ago I bought a shiney new lc. It came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with a mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you very much). 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I too have been watching the IIsi speedup reports and plan to upgrade in the next few weeks. The plan I have is to build a small board with a few different crystals on it and to be able to switch between the different speeds using a front pannel switch. This way I can get the speed when I want but I can also run at slower (stock) speeds it I experience any compatability problems with any applications. I don't expect to be able to switch clock speeds with the system running, but if I can switch without any lock-up problems, then I could switch to 33MHz when needed and put it back to idle (20 MHz) when not needeed. This would further reduce the wear-and-tear on the CPU even with a heat sink. Of course I would not want to run the different clock signals through the switch but use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desired and route it directly to the mother board. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Well I am using The Home Office. I bought it for arounde $350. It does 14.4. I don't know if it's for data or fax. But the feature I use is the Voic Mail Box, which I really have liked. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Do the accelaratores make a lot of difference? As I understand, there is graphics and cpu accelaration. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I have a Macc IIci and a Color scanner. I scanned a picture at 600 dpi. When I try to print it on my HP500 color printer, after 10 minutes of making noise, the mac hangs. I would need to reboot it. What does this mean? Do I need to buy more memory? I have 5.0 MB now. I also have about 50 MB of disk free, and the scanned picture is about 12 MB. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 We've had it happen a time or two. Beginning students think it is pretty entertaining when it happens during a lab lecture or demonstration. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I am selling my Global Village Teleport 2400 bps modem w/send fax. It connects to the mac through the ADB port. The software for sending faxes is included. I am asking $90. However, I will consider other reasonable offers. Please E-Mail me. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I have two 4 meg SIMMS that I am trying to sell. I had them in my LC. I would like to get $100 for each one. They are only three months old and have a lifetime warrenty. They are 80ns simms. I will also consider other reasonable offers. Please E-Mail me. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I remember reading a thread a few days ago that mentioned removing an external syquest drive from its case and dropping it in the internal drive of a Centris. . . I was going to do that with my 610, but had a couple of questions. My PLI 80M syquest drive has a wire from the drive to an id# switch on the outside of the case. Where do I connect this switch?? Can the computer just "tell" with internal drives? I noticed that the drive will lay over part of the motherboard (I didn't look closely, but I seem to recall it laying over the ram that's soldered onto the motherboard? Would that cause problems? One last question! Is there anywhere to order a faceplate cover? the drive's front panel is smaller than the space left in the case (the drive's panel is the same size as the spotsBM clone's cases). Should I just cut a hole in the plastic panel that is currently holding tmpty place? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Actually, an accelerator such as the Daystar 33 MHz 68040 is cheaper than upgrading to a Q700 (25 MHz). The accelerator costs about $1400 whereas the upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer). However the Q700 upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21" with 8 bit depth and up to 16" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM). It also has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which makes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Hi all: Thanks to you all who have responded to my request for info on various kinds of fax modem. I'd like to ask a few more questions. 1. What are the advantages of buying a global village Teleport Gold over other cheaper brands like Supra, Zoom etc? 2. I heard that both Supra and Zoom use the same software. Why are there so many complaints about the incompatibility problems of Supra? What kind of incompatibility is it? 3. If I decided to buy the Teleport Gold, is there any possibility to add a voice option in the near future? 4. Has anyone heard of a possible voice option that Supra will offer this coming summer? 5. A person did mention a new AT&T modem. Is it getting good reviews from various Mac Magazines? 6. If I want the best, fastest, most economically sound and possible voice option, what fax modem should I buy? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Are there any graphics cards for the SE/30 that also have, say, an 040 accelerator? There seem to be plenty of accelerator/graphics cards for the _SE_, but none (that I've seen) for the SE/30. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 When is Apple supposed to start bundlign the new ergonomic ADB Mouse II with all CPUs sold? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I am having trouble with SCSI on a Mac IIfx. The machine is 3 years old and I have been using the same hard drive (internal Maxtor LXT-200S) for two and a half years. The disk recently crashed. I reformatted (Silverlining 5.42), but during the reformat I received random write errors during testing. The error message reported was like: 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Check out the National Instruments NB-DSP2300. This uses the Texas Instruments TMS320C30 chip, which is a true 32 bit floating point DSP. It's pricey, however. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I don't know about the Instrutech boards (though I plan to check them out), but you need to be very careful checking the monotonicity and S/N ratio of many of the "16 bit" boards out there. The NI boards are very clearly specified in terms of monotonicity, S/N ratio, accuracy, etc; and the NB-A2100 and NB-A2150 have all the dyynamic range and freedom from distortion that you'd expect from a good, true 16 bit converter. This is not true for the Spectral Innovations boards, for example. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 If you get teh IIvx -C650 upgrade, does it include a new sticker to cover the IIvx identifier with a Centris 650 indetifier? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Ah, but why? Can some technically-hip Macslinger tell us what the difference is between PDS and Nubus? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I thnik i'll be able to pick up a piar of Mac 512K's for nothing, but their power supplies are dead. Anyone know where I can pick up a pair of refurbished PS's for cheap (preferably mail order). Yes, I do have uses planned fior them. One will be sold to a friend who just needs a terminal to connect via modem to his e-mail account. The other will be used by me as a net client to run my downloads and/or printing. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I've had my Duo 230 for a few weeks now and suffer from both of the above problems. I reinstalled my system software twice in an effort to combat the problems - thinking they were system software problems. Initially reinstalling the system seemed to help but not anymore. Occasionally when I try to wake up the Duo I get a solid screen of horizontal lines on the screen - it freezes.

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 There was a discussion a couple of weeks ago about using different cables to achieve different resolutions on the Quadra and Centris series. A company that sold the cables was mentioned. Can someone please e-mail me the companies name, address, etc, and any other info that may be relevant? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 So, will it be possible to have a NuBus or PDS PowerPC upgrade, or will it require a logic board swap? It would be interesting for Apple to come out with a NuBus PowerPC that allowed use of the CPU's 680x0, like RocketShare. But I guess that's getting a bit fantastic! 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 You've heard about Apple's great new customer "support" program. Well, think again. Sometimes the only real support out there is what Apple computer users can give to each other. For another example, read on: 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Yes, it is possible to add a second hard drive to a mac IIcx internally. This is definitely not a recommended procedure by Apple but I have done the equivalent to my CX after upgrading it to a Quadra 700. The power supply is still the stock CX's and it was able to power two Quantum LPS drives, a PLI SCSI accelerator, a Micron technologies 24 bit video board, Daystar QuickCache, New Technologies Overdrive and 20 meg of RAM simultaneously. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I have read one report of a brave soul who rewired the 40 mhz clock and a higher speed clock oscillator's outputs through a double throw switch to allow different speeds. There was no mention of any attempts to switch speeds on the fly but if the SI uses timing loops anything like a Quadra for accessing its floppy drive, dynamic switching will wreak havoc. A Quadra must reboot after having its clock speed significantly changed or it will be unable to properly access its floppy drive.

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Macintosh IIsi, 3/40, 80ns. Clock-upgraded IIsi works well at 25MHZ, however, does not work with Nubus adaptor and 1400k disk even though it can read/write 800k disk at32MHz. Interestingly, upgraded IIsi overcomes basically the fighting between the Vedio and the System so that CPU never be reduced below 8 no mater whether the cache is on or off. This is pretty useful when you use the virtual memory of system 7.

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Hello, I just got some SIMMs, at least one of which does not work. I don't know if there is a software that can test SIMMs thoroughly or I could just rely on the RAM test performed by my computer during the start up. When I installed a dead SIMM into an LC or an LC II, there would be a strange music and no display on the screen. Why? I need your help! Thanks in advance 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 You're not going to like this, but if memory serves me, postings I've read in this newsgroup and elsewhere indicate that there are no, repeat no, internal modems for the Duo besides the Express Modem... at _any_ speed. Something having to do with the modem using the main CPU for some of its tasks, and Apple not releasing details on the architecture, or something. I'm vague on the details, but the gist was that there are going to be no third-party internal Duo modems. If I'm wrong, somebody please correct me on this. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I think you meant Quadra 800 ..... (but a Centris 800 probably would be a real nice machine... :) )

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The Duo Powerbooks seem to park the heads after a few seconds of inactivity... is that builtin into the drive logic or is it being programmed via software, any way to tune the iddle timeout that makes the heads park themselves... I think the heads are being parked since after a few seconds of inactivity you can hear the clunk of heads parking.

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 According to the official documentation, failure to use the IIfx terminator can not only affect SCSI bus performance but can also damage the bus. Whether this is your problem or not I don't know. I have had sporadic SCSI problems with my IIfx since I bought it. (I cannot connect more than three devices, fourth one causes major problems). 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I've been looking into getting a portable Mac to do some work and I've had my eye on the PB 100. Lately, I've been seeing people with the old portables, and they're selling for $300 LESS that the PB 100s. What I want to know is: what are the differences between them? All I know is that the Portable is heavier, but the PB100 doesn't have an internal drive. Here's what I NEED to know: 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I think that there do exist NuBus expansion cages (I'm sure I've seen them advertised occassionally), but I think that the main problem is that they cost much more than the difference in price between say a LC and IIvx so unless you need lots of NuBus slots its not worth the bother. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I've just installed a 5.25" tape backup in my C610; lot of the issues are the same. So, to answer your questions... 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 If Apple didn't put out such a good product -- I'd gladly take my business to -- to -- the 8-bit Ataris. I think the situation with the Express modem is inexusable for any business. I've had mine on order since January. Apple finally called me last week -- to tell me that I should have it "by the second week of May." In the meantime, I've been stuck with my Duo210 without the connectability I needed it for. I'm sure there are plenty of people who can bite back at me, citing all sorts of reasons why Apple is right or at least justified, but I'm just a crabby consumer and when I order a "Duo210 with modem" that's the product I expect. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 A week or so ago, I posted about a problem with my SE/30: I have 20 megs or true RAM, yet if I set my extensions to use a large amount of memory (total of all extensions) then my system will crash before the finder comes up. What I meant was having a large amount of fonts load, or sounds, or huge disk caches with a control panel other than Apple's memory control panel. Apple's cache is at 64K, mode 32 is on, and so is 32 bit addressing. All extensions work by themselves or with the others until I increase the memory used by some of them (with methods mentioned above).

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 My boss is considering the purchase of a Powerbook or Duo. He is leaning towards a 180, because of the math coprocessor (for Mathematica), but would get a Duo if he could find a Mini-Dock with a coprocessor. Have any third-parties announced such a beast? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Anyone know what would cause my IIcx to not turn on when I hit the keyboard switch? The one in the back of the machine doesn't work either... The only way I can turn it on is to unplug the machine for a few minutes, then plug it back in and hit the power switch in the back immediately... Sometimes this doesn't even work for a long time... 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I have one of the original Powerbook 170's (with 4Mb of Ram) and find that 4Mb is a drag when trying to do my work. So, what is the best way to get the maximum RAM for this unit, and what's it going to cost me? I'm hoping I can get the latest and best info from real users by posting to this group.

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I write: I recently got a ZyXEL U-1496E modem. It's great, but I'm still having some problems figuring out what strings to use in what applications. I basically need strings for Z-term, FirstClass client, and Telefinder client. I've been able to get FirstClass and Z-term working by using another modem's settings in FirstClass and copying them for Z-term. However, it still has problems - Z-term, for example, will list 'ERROR' the first time I try dialing after starting the problem. If I cancel and try again, it works fine. Telefinder is even worse - I can't get it to even wake up the modem. So, if anyone uses a ZyXEL for any of these programs, I'd greatly appreciate you sending me the setup strings you use Thanks in advance! 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Hi everyone. Just the other day, I ordered a VRAM chip for my new LCIII from Mac Connection. They sent it overnight (very nice) and I got it installed, and we found that it didn't work properly. When you put the computer in thousands mode, the bottom of the screen (using the new chip) is all flickering and fuzzy. So I called them up and I'm going to return it for a new one. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Here is the story: I have a network with 4 Macs on Localtalk. One of them has an Ethernet Card, and is currently connected to a NeXT (don't laugh I got it for the price of a Mac IIsi). The NeXT is connected to the internet over SLIP running on a 9600 baud modem. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I have an external hard drive I wish to use as startup disk. problem is, when I switch on the mac, it boots on the internal HD, but when I restart (warm boot) the mac, it boots from the external. how do I make it boot directly from the external ? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I have found that the cache upgrade options for the Mac IIsi include the following:t1) AE QuickSilver 2) Daystar Fastcache IIsi 3) Daystar ComboCache IIsi 4) LogiCache IIsi 64k cache 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I can't say for sure with the IIvx - C650 upgrade, but I wondered the same thing when I ordered my LC - LC III upgrade. Turns out the "upgrade" is actually an entire CPU minus any disk drives. You pull the floppy and hard drives out of the old one, stick them in the new one, and you've got an LC III.

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Well Bill, There are 2MB soldered on the logic board and 2MB in the RAM expansion slot giving you 4MB. The only thing you can do to upgrade to the maximum Ram is to remove the 2MB expansion and install a 6MB expansion, giving you a total of 8MB which is the max on a 170....You can try calling TechWorks, or any other memory vendors out of MacWeek, MacWorld...etc.... 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 For the most part, this is a bunch of bunk. I've got a Computer Engineering degree, yet I've spent the last 7 years writing software that people actually use. Moreover, the salary distinctions are incorrect; I received 3 job offers upon graduation; the two jobs that actually used my hardware experience were $7000/year lower! My advice is to decide which classes and projects most interest you, and pick the major that allows you to take them. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I also suffer from these video "artefacts". My configuration is a Centris 610, 4/160, 1MB VRAM with a NEC 4FG. It only happens at 832x624, in 8bit colour with virtual memory off during scrolling. This occurs when the VRAM SIMMS are installed as well as removed. It seems that the 610 does not like 832x624.

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 A few posts back, somebody mentioned that the Duo might crash if it has the wrong kind (non-self refreshing) of RAM in it. My Duo crashes sometimes after sleep, and I am wondering if there is any software which will tell me whether or not I have the right kind of RAM installed. I had thought that the problem was the battery connection.

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I think this kind of comparison is pretty useless in general. The processor is only good when a good computer is designed around it adn the computer is used in its designed purpose. Comparing processor speed is pretty dumb because all you have to do is just increase the clock speed to increase speed among other things. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Not a good idea to compare processor power. Doesn't make sense for real world applications. At least not for totally different lines of processors. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Not quite. 66MHz Pentium - 65 SPECint92, 57 SPECfp92 . 66MHz MC98601 - 50 SPECint92, 80 SPECfp92 . 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 How about some numbers here? Some kind of benchmark? If you want, let me start it - 486DX2-66 - 32 SPECint92, 16 SPECfp92 . 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Yes, quite a number of people it seems from discussions I've had (me included). I bought my machine a couple of weeks ago as well and started to experience these problems. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Some pixels on my PB 140 display disappear intermittently. They are not in a particular place but random. If anybody has suggestions I would appreciate e-mailings. Thanks. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 But the interesting comparision is how fast clock-cycle chips you can get - an Alpha is WAY slow at 66 MHz, but blazes at 200 MHz. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Be very careful when you plug in a external monitor and a external speaker. Make sure that all the power cords are in the same strip. If you don't you take a chance of having a very bad audio buzz. This is caused be a "ground loop" and the only way of getting rid of this loud buzz is to make sure that you have a common ground. Make sure that all the power cords are going in to the same strip or off the same outlet. This will assure you of a common ground. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Does anyone know if there are any devices available for the Mac which will increase the number of serial ports available for use simultaneously? I would like to connect up to 8 serial devices to my Mac for an application I am working on. I must be able to access each one of the independently. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Does anyone know what hardware is required and where I could find it for sound recording on the Mac Portable. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I just hooked up my Mac IIsi to a relatively old (1 year?) Asante EN/SC adapter. The 10Base-T connection works like a charm. I installed the newest drivers from Asante's ftp server. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Applied Engineering makes a NuBus card called the QuadraLink which is a board that contains 4 serial ports, which I believe can be used simultaneously. I'm not a user of one of these, but I have installed a couple for people at work (I'm a technician). Hope this helps. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 eu Apple does not authorise sales through Mail Order. As a result mail eu order companies have to obtain their machines by the grey market. eu eu This market is supplied with machines from authorised resellers who eu have more machines than they can sell. They come into this state of eu affairs by overordering either accidentally or deliberatly to get a eu better wholsale price from Apple. In either case they often obscure eu the serial nunber to protect their identity. As a result the warranty eu is void. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Hi, I got a glimpse from the other side, talking to the technician at the place I recently bought my Mac from. The guy told me that they stopped shipping SIMMs to their customers and only install them themselves - those babies get zapped too easily by static electricity or so they claim. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 How do you calculate that figure? I'd assume even in personal computers the board designers would use bank switching to (optimistically) quadruple the access speed or am I missing something here? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The previous article referred to the fact that you could only use 20ns SIMMs in a 50MHz machine, but that you could use 80ns SIMMs in slower machines. I just pointed out that if you could only use 20ns SIMMs in a 50MHz machine, you can't use 80ns SIMMs in anything faster than a 12.5 MHz machine. Bank switching and caches were not considered in either example (although both would help memory access). 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 If you get the Centris 650 with CD configuration, you are getting a Mac with a 68RC040 processor that has built-in math coprocessor support. My understanding is that the "optional fpu" refers to your option of purchasing the Centris 650 4/80 without FPU OR one of the other configurations WITH FPU. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I remember seeing complete instructions for making PhoneNET adapters, MIDI adapters and a MacRecorder lookalike. After a short search through Mac.archive and info-mac I failed to see any of the above. Any pointers? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 This can be caused by two one of two things. The first and easiest to fix is interference from something around the monitor, such as another monitor or other electrical device. Try moving the system to another location to fix that problem. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Does anyone know if a Nanao 750i is compatible with any popular Mac video cards? I have an oppurtunity to get a brand new one, cheap, and I am very tempted, but it will be a waste of time if I can't drive it using a standard video card. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Perhaps the reason is simple--maybe the marketing people who put together the brochures and price lists weren't clear on the FPU issue. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 My mac monitor displays about 20 vertical lines when I use it. It means that either my display memory goes wrong or monitor is bad or video card is bad. I checked my monitor, it works fine with other Mac. I checked my video card, it's also fine. I replaced all the RAMs, it still didn't give me right answer. Hence I assume something wrong with some part of my motherboard. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Hi. I think I have a problem with the stereo sound output on my Quadra 900, but I am not totally sure because my roomate has the same problem on his PowerBook 170. Any info or experience anyopne has would be greatly appreciated. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I had the same problem with my 512 a long time ago. Resoldering the joints on the motherboard (all of them) fixed it. Turns out that continuous heating and cooling caused annular (ring-shaped) cracks to develop in the solder, effectively cutting the video circuitry off. If you're not a solder-jockey you might want to have someone else do it -- I took mine to an electrical engineer buddy -- but it was a 20-minute job, tops. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Here is the MacWeek article describing the DUO ram situation. (w/o permission. I hope that is ok) 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Mac sound hardware is diverse; some macs play in stereo and mix the output (the SE/30 for instance) while others play in stereo but ONLY has the left channel for the speaker, while some are "truly" mono (like the LC) 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I'm a system and network admin. One of my users has a Duo 230 ([*]specifications below) that has been having slowdown problems. Leaving the Duo on for several hours causes it to slow down unacceptably. It can take 10-15 seconds to change applications. During this time it is completely hung. If he reboots, the problem goes away (For a while). It seems the system is getting itself into a wedged configuration. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Is it possible, ie via creative cable splicing or whatever, to hook a Syquest 44MB removable drive to a Mac? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I just bought a select 300 and rushed home to print some grayscale pictures for my kids, when I discovered that grayscale(and photograde) are not available if you are using an SE...even if you are running with an '030 cpu. You won't see this in the printer's docs, and the Apple rep didn't mention it to our users group either. It seems that SE ROMs won't support those "features". Okay, I guess I should have somehow known that this was the case. Let the buyer beware, huh Apple? Be that as it may, I have been thinking about the problem and I'm puzzled. Why can't a defencieny in the ROM be made up for in software. I write software for a living (on unix platforms) and I don't understand the "it just can't be done" responses I've gotten from those I have asked so far. Isn't Mode32, or somesuch piece of soft- ware, just such a fix. Anyway, I was hoping someone knowledgeable about Mac internals could set me straight: is it simply impossible for a mac SE to print grayscale, or could someone armed with enough info and a little pro- gramming experience cook something up that would supplement the ROM's capabilities? Also, how does one know if one's mac can support the grayscale and photograde that the Select 300 is supposedly capable of? ( Short of buying the printer and trying it out like I did) Thanks for your help. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 from Apple). Since it was correct on some older brochures, I can only guess that someone edited the copy, saw "inject" and thought it was a typo and changed it to the more familiar word "inkjet". 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 It's my understanding that, when you format a magneto-optical disc, (1) the formatting software installs a driver on the disc, (2) if you insert the disc in a different drive, then this driver is loaded into the computer's memory and then controls the drive, and (3) if this driver is incompatible with the drive, then the disc can not be mounted and/or properly read/written Is that correct? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 To use the grayscale features, I believe you need a Mac equipped with colour quickdraw. I was told this somewhere or other, but it's not mentioned in "Apple Facts" (guide for apple sellers), in the press release or in the technical specs. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 A member of the local BBS I frequent is looking for Mac oriented BBSs based in Chicago. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Second Wave makes NuBus card cages that work on the PDS slots of at least three Macs: the SE/30, IIsi and Centris 610. They have not, to my knowledge, announced such a device for the LCII, but they could make one, technologically. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I think you will find that the Mac SE can PRINT grayscale images, loaded with the proper software. However, the Mac SE cannot DISPLAY grayscale on its screen or any attached video because that ability is not in the ROM. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Battery powered devices like the PowerBook are sometimes more sensitive to serial port weirdness. I had trouble with connecting my Mac Plus to an HP 95LX handheld. Everything else worked okay on that port, but not the HP. (it runs on two penlite batteries). It turned out that the plus (by accident or by design flaw?) was putting a 4 volt bias on the serial port that was doing weird things to the HP (which has only 3v dc!). The HP worked fine when connected to the printer port. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Radius speculated, publicly, that they could provide a PowerPC-based Rocket for existing Macs. It would have the plus of RocketShare and the minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator, NuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Peter, I'm sure someone out there has a better/easier way to do what you want to do, but I'll tell you how we do it where I work. We have about 15 Macs networked together using Appletalk and PhoneNet connectors. To chat we use a program called 'Broadcast'. With it we can send brief messages to all or selected machines within the network. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The DayStar PowerCache for the SE/30 replaces the CPU with an accelerated CPU plus the powercache. This leavese the PDS slot open for a video card. Currenty, DayStar does not have the '040 in this configuration, but it is due out early next year. With their upgrade policy, you can get the '030 accelerator now, and when the '040 version becomes available, you get credit for the one you have. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Does one exist, who makes it, and how much? Thanks:) 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Their should be no difference in the drive itself between IBM-PC and Mac. The two main differences are the formatting of the disk itself (but with the correct software each can read the others) and maybe the cable (depends on your SCSI board on IBM-PC).

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Powerbook 100, here are a couple of the answers: (1) Does the Mac Portable support Appletalk? Yes (2) What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the 68000 running at 15.87 Mhz. (3) Does the Mac Portable run system 7? Yes, although it does use up a lot of memory. (4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors that still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors sell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell memory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most memory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether the Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine California is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB - $140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that are selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here. (5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an average access time of about 25 ms. (6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a backlit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move your head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or non-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Hi everyone. I recently posted about how I received a bad vram chip for my new LCIII, and someone responded that it may not actually be bad, but it may be a 512K LC vram chip, and thus doesn't work properly with my computer. So I'm wondering if anyone can interpret these codes for me, so I can figure out what type of chip MacConnection sent me.

All the "industry experts" we phoned (the tapedrive dealer, our Apple dealer, the software dealer) all say it's our fault, or they don't know.

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The Quadralink by AE is a possibly problematical solution to your needs. I've used one for the last 4 (?) years on my personal system, but a fatal bug has crept into their more recent s/w.

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 As a data point, I'm using a Centris 610 4/80 with the Apple 16" monitor and do NOT have these problems. DCH 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I think this is mostly the fault of the people who write up the literature and price lists being confused themselves. Since there are two possible processor configurations and one of the them doesn't have an FPU it does seem to be an option, even though it really isn't. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Apple has really confused people with this whole thing. I think we'll be answering this question for about the next year or so. There is no "option" to get an FPU on a C650. What you have is a choice of CPUs: there is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full '040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 (AppleUSA). And there is the full '040 which you get when you order anything other than the base 4/80 configuration. Therefore, since you have ordered one of the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not be getting the LC040. But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn't be able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet and an LC040. It's not an "option." Also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610s thinking that there is an optional FPU, the '040 class chip cannot recognize an external FPU, so there is no socket on the motherboard for a FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card or something like that. The only way to get an FPU in these machines is to replace the LC040 with a full '040. And if you have a C610, you will not need to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC040 with the full '040, but if you have a 4/80 C650 you do need to have a heat sink. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 What you need is a hardware router such as EtherRoute/TCP made by Compatable Systems ($1400). This will allow you to connect your Localtalk network (4 Macs) to your Ethernet network (NeXT and Ethernet Mac). It will route TCP/IP protocol between the two networks. Software routers are also available for less money, but I'm not sure if they work with TCP/IP. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Hi. I am working on a project for my marketing class and I'd like to ask your help. The assignment is to come up with a product and create a marketing plan for it. Technical issues are not terribly important at this point. Well, my group's plan is to market a "full page" monitor for laptop computers. It would be a third-party product to be installed by authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology's PaletteBook screen). The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you would get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember, technical issues aside!). In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen and the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR "full" height. The screen would probably be monochrome. The motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very popular among business people. Business people also commonly use word processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient to see a large portion of the document. Because of the target users and applications, color screens aren't really a neccessity. We could hopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I am looking for a 8 meg 72-pin SIMM for my Centris 610. Where is the best place to purchase one (stock, shipping, warrenty), and if possible, phone numbers so that I can order one as soon as possible. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I would really like to get one of the new CD300i CDROM drives for my c650, but my local Apple doesn't know when they will be available. He doesn't even have a part number yet. Does anyone know what the part number for this drive is and when it will be available? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 My company has developed an application for the Mac that emulates a chart recorder - virtual pen traces scroll smoothly across the screen. As we tested the application on a number of computers we discovered some surprising performance differences across products. The scroll performance of the IIsi and LCII was better than the IIfx. This led us to investigate Color Quickdraw performance across the Apple line.

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Hi! A while back, there was a thread in this group about the use of the IWII in Europe (in countries with 50 Hz AC current). The consensus at the time was that the IWII would not work there. As I will be moving there this summer, I called Apple to make sure and they told me (today) that the IWII (as bought in the U.S.) will definitely run on 50 Hz AC current (as long as a step-down converter is employed if 240 V current is used). The same info, turns out, can be found in the IWII manual (p. 127 in the 1989 version), but I didn't really trust that. Does anyone have any direct experience to the contrary? Just wondering. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The CD300 (external) is already shipping and has been shipping for quite awhile now. Demand for the units are high, so they are pretty rare. I've seen them listed for around $525-550 at local computer stores and the campus Mac reseller. I've also heard rumors that they are bundled with a couple of CD's, but I can't confirm it. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 We're about ready to take a bold step into the 90s around here by accelerating our rather large collection of stock MacPlus computers. Yes indeed, difficult to comprehend why anyone would want to accelerate a MacPlus, but that's another story. Suffuce it to say, we can get accelerators easier than new machines. Hey, I don't make the rules... 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Is there a fix for this? We have a Quadra 900 that will NOT finish startup unless there is a monitor connected. This would be no problem, but since we're running it as a file server, there is no need to have a monitor connected all the time. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I have a strange piece of equipment to unload. It is a Ether+ SCSI interface. Apparently, it can be plugged into a SCSI port and from there to an ethernet.

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I've got two CD300's... The first one i ordered Jan 15, and I received it Feb. 20. The second one I ordered Jan 20th, and I just got it April 2nd or so. Anyway, they both come with 10 misc. CDROMs... Things like a "Intro to Nautilis", a sample CD of Kodak pictures, "From Alice to Ocean" (a story of a woman who treked across Austrailia), 3 discs from apple, a games disc, an applications disc, and a "titles" disc (haven't checked most of these out yet). Also some "Cinderella" thing for kids, a disc of Mozart something-or-others, etc. etc. etc. If someone's super interested, I'll make a list of the exact titles and post them. They are all in the category of "Interesting, but probably fairly useless...". It was rumored that the earliest units shipped with SOME encyclocpedia (it may have), but neither of my drives had that.

I'll primarily only be 'conversing' over CompuServe or some other link to the Internet, but I'm not sure if those systems can supply ME with data at 14.4k. Another question I have is in some of the modem lingo out there. I understand baud rates, but what does V3.4 and V3.4bis mean? I could really use some suggestions as to what a good modem for around $300 would be, and why it would be a good choice.

The display is bearly readable but all the details are seperated into yellow and red colors. ie. a window will have two images one in yellow and a ghost image in red. The background is also a little greenish. I read some time ago, before I ever thought I would hook my mac up to a VGA screen, about an incompatability with some VGA monitors due to the sync on green signal. Does this sound like it could be the same demon? I also read that there are both hardware (putting a diode on the green signal?) solution and a software solution to this problem. I don't the details does somebody have them the can e-mail to me or post them? I checked all the FAQ's for this and didn't find anything about it. Did I miss it somewhere? This sure seems that it would be a good thing to have in one. Thanks for any replys. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 While there may not be a part number for the CD300i drive, I have seen a part number for the bezel kit (a new front panel with the slot in it through which you insert the CD). The document (which I got from the 2/10/93 announcement at our Apple office) states the drive kit and bezel kits are separate items and the bezel kit has an SRP of $149 fro the C650. The external unit may be a better deal after all.

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Can anyone tell me what the difference is between a 256K DRAM chip and a 256K SIMM? I need the former (I think) to add memory to my Laserwriter LS. Someone is offering to sell me 256K SIMMS he removed from an SE, but I have a feeling this may not be the correct form of memory. The sockets in the Laserwriter look like they want the spidery-shaped chips (there are 4 sockets, each with, as I recall, 20 pins, arranged in two rows of 10). Believe it or not, I've never actually seen a SIMM. Help appreciated. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 You macinators who have used these voice messaging/FAX/data-modems. I have a question.

Approximately, how much hard drive space does an average day of callers take up, if they speak for one minute? Any feed back would be appreciated. My company is looking at buying one or two. Hey, I may buy one myself too.

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Jeff, I have answers to both of your questions. First, I recommend the Sony CPD-1320 monitor. It is a 14" Trinitron VGA monitor, but it is designed specifically for use with the LC. It works only with Macs with specific video capabilities which means only the LC's and anything after the ci. All it takes is a MAC<-VGA cable (I recommend one from James Engineering which is about $20). These cost about $335 as compared to the much higher prices of comparable monitors because they are not multisynch. I have used one for half a year and I love it. Second, I have used Syex and found them to be decent. I had a backorder on a Supra modem which I cancelled. They were helpful in explaining the reasons why there were delays and they had Supra's number ready for me. The only complaint was that they did not always return my calls. I have been told that the CPD-1320 is selling for $339 from J&R's (800)221-8180. I think Syex is a little more, but I don't know. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I have a 512k VRAM chip for sale. Worked fine in my LCII and will give 256 colors on 640 x 480 size screen. Asking $50. I'll cover postage.

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The real question here in my opinion is what Motorola processors running system 7 on a MAC are comparable to what Intel processors running Windows on a PC? I recall there being a conversation here that a 486/25 running Windows benchmarks at about the same speed as 25Mhz 030 in system 7. I don't know if that is true, but I would love to hear if anyone has any technical data on this.

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I want to go from 512K to 1M VRAM on my Quadra 800. How many 512K SIMMS do I need to buy? Is the current 512K soldered on the board or do I need to take out the current VRAM before I add more?

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 ha... all this talk about changing the clock speed of the q700 makes me ask?? if i replaced the 8mhz 68000 in my plus with a 16mhz 68000 with a 16mhz clock occilater of its own( not shared by the rest of the mac... just the new 16mhz68000) would my mac work..... and if it would work.. would you think there where be any problems with sound, vidio,scsi........ 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 1) I have an old Jasmine drive which I cannot use with my new system. My understanding is that I have to upsate the driver with a more modern one in order to gain compatability with system 7.0.1. does anyone know of an inexpensive program to do this? ( I have seen formatters for <$20 buit have no idea if they will work) 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Yes, E-Machines makes two mini-docks--the Powerlink Presente and the PowerLink DeskNet. The Presenter offers a variety of video-out options, including NTSC, RGB and SVGA. It also has sound out, floppy drive port and a power port. Unfortunately no SCSI port and it blocks the serial port. The DeskNet has the standard ports plus built-in EtherNet. Alas, none of these have an FPU. In the future, RasterOps is putting out a mini-dock, but the name escapes me now. It is supposed to support 16-bit color and "Quadra" comparable video speed. No idea if it has an FPU. Hope this helps... 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I think you must be talking about the Syquest 105 (code named Mesa I believe). It is a 3.5" Winchester technology drive pretty much like the other Syquest drives in terms of how it works. According to the latest MacLeak, the drive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures are from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of performance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC and just recently was released for the Mac world (don't ask me what the differences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according to a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production. I have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak including PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse's PowerUser. The PLI and MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands are going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold 105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges are cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives. Cost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli drives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more reliable. Personally, I'm excited by the new drive and look forward to getting my hands on one. -Chris Wand

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Whatever equipment will work on a mac plus or a mac se will work fine on a mac portable. It doesn't have a sound input, but there is equipment that works fine with those models mentioned in macuser/macworld. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 the Q700 will only do 8bit or 24bit color. if you want the higher color depth, it's 2MB's of VRAM altogether for a monitor up to 16". 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Hmmm... Sounds vaguely similar to a problem I had a long time ago when I was trying to use Kermit. I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210 and my NeXT. I think the problem was in the handshaking. Basically, you need to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides. A safe place to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end. One problem is that the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it wrong, and only a reset will clear it. I don't know the specifics. But this could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system. It could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one wrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further correct actions, until the next machine reset. I have wedged my Mac and also my NeXT that way. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The PowerBook 170 hardware doesn't have a wakeup timer. Nor does the 140. The Mac Portable had one, and I think the PowerBook 100 had one. I don't know about the newer PowerBooks, but I kind of doubt it. I got bit by this too, and it took my a while rooting around on the developer CD before I found this out. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 To the best of my knowledge there aren't any problems with Quadras and blind transfers. Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer screwed up the TIBs or didn't test their driver with the device in question. Well designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of 16µsec occur. This usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some devices can "hiccup" in the middle of blocks. If this happens in the middle of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte depending on which direction the tranfer was going. In anycase the SCSI Manager will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because it is out of sync. Actual data loss would only occur if the driver didn't pay attention to the errors coming back. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Is this being done with the motherboard's SCSI interface? If this is possible then a bit of experimenting with just plain old clock oscillators may be in order. Give us some more details please. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Is anyone out there using a greyscale handscanner. I'm thinking about buying one. Is the inexpensive Logitech pretty good. I don't need super high quality scans- but want it to be worth the $$$$. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I recently upgraded to System 7.1 and now I also upgraded my DeskWriter drivers from 2.2 to 3.1. I got the software from Sumex, but it is not clear to me where to install what. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 does anyone have any good code to drive the serial port in syncronos mode? I really need it BAD 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The Logitech ScanMan 32 is a nice unit, compact and effective it will bring in graphics with surprisingly good quality. Note that its effective resolution in grey scale mode is only about 72 dpi. If you don't intend to magnify a graphic, it works fine. A true 256 level gray scanner would work better for images. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Just my luck. I did however call my local Apple dealer and he said that the he thinks the serial numbers of the machines that are covered begin with either 70 or 53-56, and maybe one other. He also told me that Apple had extended the service on these serial numbers for another year!!! 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 of apple. They simply change crystals and add a fan. Hammerhead: Centris 610 was able to work with 25 MHz (cooler prefered) and for 1000 DM you get an 68040 (33MHz) which works with the appropriate crystal at full speed. (extra cooling required) Centris 650 like Quadra 700 with extra cooling 33MHz works on most machines and for real power enthusiasts they used a Quadra 950 at 40 MHz wow! But for better description you should get this issue of C't (a german PC magazine!) 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Note that if you get the external CD300 for your Centris or Q800 you will miss out on the sound mixing feature unless you are willing to run a wire from the motherboard sound input connector to the stereo output on the CD. Connecting to the sound input port on the back of the computer won't do unless you can live with mono.

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 After reading reports from Germany of success in accelerating a Quadra or Centris simply by changing the clock oscillator, I decided to test the claim. I pulled out my Variable Speed Overdrive and the motherboard's 50 mhz clock chip. I put a socket in the clock's place and inserted a 64 mhz TTL clock oscillator I had left over from working on some SI's. I can't believe it. It actually works. I'm not getting SCSI timing errors either. This is only after a short run time but I'll keep posting results. Did I spend all that money on the VSO for nothing? If this keeps working, the lack of a double boot in itself will be worth the effort. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Hello world, does anyone know of a Postscript PPD for a Versatec A0-size plotter, which is generally accessed via a ZEH Postscript interpreter? Replies by e-mail very gratefully received - this is proving to be quite a tricky one.

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Try Goldstar. They make them, and they are available immediately in Mac configurations. I ordered a pair from Computerland (8 meg variety) and they work like a charm. I've had them for two weeks. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Hmm, I don't know where this information concerning the cable and the warranty came from but I ordered mine from Logos Communications, near Cleveland, and inside was a Mac cable (with the correct pin connections :-)) and a lifetime warranty. The whole package was assembled at AT&T Paradyne, and every piece (the serial cable, the telephone cable, etc.) had AT&T part numbers on them, except the QuickLink software package and the CompuServe intro kit. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 My Apple 13" RGB monitor has over the past few months gone brighter and brighter and the colors are not as rich as before. Has anyone out there encountered a similar problem? Dows anyone happen to know what this problem may be due to? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I have tested this on a 230 and it does work there. So it would seem that the 140 and 170 are out though. One way to tell is to go and open the PowerBook control panel(7.1). There is a setting there that allows you to set the time to wake up the Mac. If it is present when you open the control panel, then you can assume that SetWUTime will work. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I have a Lightening Scan Pro 256 hand scanner. It came with scanning/editing software, OCR software, and some plug-in modules for Photoshop et al. The scanner was a tad on the pricey side ($480), but the scans are incredibly accurate, in 256 level, 300 dpi grayscale. It also has dithered and line art settings when grayscale isn't desired. Great scanning software, easy to use. I frequently write letters to my neices, and spontaneouly include a scanned image in the note. Hope this helps! 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Can some people with cache cards PLEASE post speedometer numbers they get with the cards. I have only one report, which seems to indicate that a 32K cache card gives you only about a 1% speedup!! Access to memory takes LONGER when you have a cache card(and get a miss) thus a small cache card of 32K may be worth $0. I don't know what kind of numbers 64K cards get you. Also I found it interesting that you can disable the cache cards via software(read about it in the Mac IIsi tech notes from ftp.apple.com)

comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The si has a single expansion slot, that can be either PDS or Nubus, but not both together. The card lies parallel to and above the motherboard & HD and requires an adaptor slot to do this. There are Nubus and PDS adaptort cards. Thus, what kind of slots you have depends on what kind of adapter card you have. With the exception of the Radius rocket, all NuBus cards I know of work in the si. PDS slots and thus cards are Mac specific, thus not all PDS cards work in all Macs. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Does anyone know exactly how Digital Eclipse does their upgrades? Someone was suggesting to me that some chips may not be able to perform at 33MHz. Is this true, and if so, how does DESI deal with that? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 None. You need to buy 2 80ns 256k VRAM SIMMs. They cost about $30 each from your favorite memory distributor. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Could be better caching on the disk. Could be faster coil for seeks. Could be that the disk spins faster so data transfers faster. Could be that data is packed tighter so it transfers faster. Could be a faster SCSI command decoder in the drive. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 You need to add two 256K VRAM SIMMs; 512K VRAM SIMMs will not work in any of the Quadra or Centris machines. There is already 512K of VRAM soldered to the logic board. You add the two 256K SIMMs to this to give you a total of 1 MB. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Ok. I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a 64KB cache. It's small enough that I will attach it. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 What I did NOT get with my drive (CD300i) is the System Install CD you listed as #1. Any ideas about how I can get one? I bought my IIvx 8/120 from Direct Express in Chicago (no complaints at all -- good price & good service). 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Could someone please e-mail or post a cheap source for ink carts for the HP Deskwriter? Original HP carts are preferred, but I will settle for third-party brands if they are of good quality. 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 The Sound Driver is pretty ok, since it's fast. Sound Manager used by the book is *useless*. Disposing of sound channels as soon as sound has completed is out of the question for games with smooth animation. (It's too slow.) 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 I am trying to put a 40MB drive from my LC into a case. It is a Conner CP3040A. I can't figure out which jumpers are the SCSI ID jumpers. Is anyone familiar with this drive? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Does GX take the place of 32 bit QD or add to it? Right now 32 bit is kinda aesthetically a pain in a few places because of hacks upon hacks to maintain compatibility with original QD---I think of things like where you have to cast CGrafPorts to GrafPorts and such. It would be a lot cleaner to ditch this entire mess and start over---do we get that? 
comp.sys.mac.hardware	 Is there a workaround which will enable me to print to a HPLJ4 from my Powerbook 100? (Actually I'm going to a 4M which will have an Ethernet card in the LocalTalk slot!!!GRRRRR). Is there some hardware which will enable me to this easily (kind of plug and play!).

comp.windows.x	 I don't know a great deal about the support for C++ in UIM/X, but I can tell you that there is good support for it in TeleUSE. In TeleUSE you can call any C++ method from a "D" module. What you can do then is to use the "D" language for most of your interface code and then use C++ for you application code.

comp.windows.x	 I'm writing 'xwall', a simple X version of 'wall', and I want it to put a message up on each of a default list of displays. The problem is that XOpenDisplay hangs if one of the displays is currently controlled by xdm (login screen). I've been through the manuals and FAQ and don't see a simple way to see if a display is 'openable' ahead of time, or to get XOpenDisplay to fail after a short period of time. Any hints, suggestions, clues, or pointers to info? Thanks...

comp.windows.x	 I've been using the XmGraph widget that's been floating around and I noticed the performance is significantly better using Gadgets, perhaps even 100% faster. I had heard in an old programming course that gadgets were no longer any benefit to performance, and that it's just as well to use widgets everywhere. So why would ~50 pushbutton gadgets be a lot quicker than 50 pushbuttons in the graph? Should I start putting gadgets back into my long pulldown menus? 
comp.windows.x	 No. This is only relevant for OpenWindows 3.x as shipped with SunOS. It is not relevant for MIT R5. MIT R5 should compile without problems. 
comp.windows.x	 I have been building X11 with gcc since 2.1 and the only time I had trouble was when the position independant code option broke (so I couldn't use gcc to build Sun shared libraries). The important thing to do is to follow the tips given in the gcc release. Gcc generates code that requires libgcc2 and you should take that into account when deciding which compiler to use for the libraries. 
comp.windows.x	 I need to have PCs and SPARCstations run the same application ( namely MicroSoft Project ). The original system ran on the PC. Now it needs to be expanded to allow UNIX users to work with the application. The current proposal is to use DESQview/X as a display server for the application. 
comp.windows.x	 It's my understanding that the next release of UIM/X, due out last February :-) has full support for C++. 
comp.windows.x	 You are right in supposing that the problem is with the XmNcolormap (XtNcolormap for truly literate beings) not being set. What you want to do is start your application with your new colormap. This can be a chicken and egg sort of problem, however. If you look at the Xt FAQ there is an example that should show how it can be done. If not, let me know and maybe I can improve the example. 
comp.windows.x	 They aren't functions, they are character arrays. The standard strings are either defined as string constants or character pointers into XtShellStrings and XtStrings determined by XTSTRINGDEFINES. Your libraries were compiled with this defined and your application with it undefined so simply recompile one or the other. It is probably worth adding -DXTSTRINGDEFINES to your CFLAGS. 
comp.windows.x	 I have a program produces a continuous tone by calling XBell repeatedly at an interval equal to the duration of the bell. If it is run more than once on a display, the tones are buffered in the X server and the tone contunues after all occurrences of the program have exited. Is there a convenient way of preventing this, e.g., by emptying the X server bell buffer when each program exits? - Disclaimer: Please note that the above is a personal view and should not be construed as an official comment from the JET project. 
comp.windows.x	 At Robert Gordon University, programming was the main (most time-consuming) start of the course. The first two years consisted of five subjects: Software Engineering (Pascal/C/UNIX), Computer Engineering (6502/6809/68000 assembler), Computer Theory (LISP/Prolog), Mathematics/Statistics and Communication Skills (How to pass interviews/intelligence tests and group discussions e.g. How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea). The third year (Industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company for a year. The company could be anywhere in Europe (there was a special Travel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors). The fourth year included Operating Systems(C/Modula-2), Software Engineering (C/8086 assembler), Real Time Laboratory (C/68000 assembler) and Computing Theory (LISP). There were also Group Projects in 2nd and 4th Years, where students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an outside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change suddenly).

comp.windows.x	 You wanna do masking. Build a bitmap (pixmap of depth one) where all pixels you name "opaque" are 1 (that get copied) and the others are 0. Use this bitmap as the clip_mask in the gc used for XCopyArea(), and remember to adjust the clip_origin coordinates to the XCopyArea() blit origin. 
comp.windows.x	 No. As soon as you blit two of this icons once on top of the other with a little dislocation, you see the rectangular blit crashes too much of the icon first blitted, because it draws a full rectangle. The way to do it is masking: Create a bitmap with all pixels to be merged are 1 and all not to be merged are 0. Then, set the clip_mask of the gc to this bitmap, set the clip_x_origin and clip_y_origin of the gc to the x/y coordinates where you blit the icon to the destination drawable, use GXCopy, and XCopyArea() the icon pixmap to the destination drawable using this gc.

Sun has made no such claim regarding Devguide, and as manager of the Devguide engineering group I can state with authority that work on Devguide is continuing apace. We had quite a strong show of interest from the Devguide user community at last week's Solaris Developer's Conference. Devguide is being advocated not only as a valuable future builder tool, but as an important bit of transition technology that will help sustain current customers and facilitate their migration to the COSE Desktop Environment.

comp.windows.x	 IMHO this whole discussion named "Motif looks like MS-Windogs" is totally stupid. The only thing remotely influenced here can be the Motif Window Manager, that features an arrangement of buttons and menus somewhat similiar to this of the MS-W windowmanaging agent, however its name is. But MWM is only a SMALL part of Motif, in fact, MWM and Motif can work without each other, and if one doesn't like MWMs outfit for some reason, he switches to another windowmanager. All this doesn't influence Motif, which is a toolkit of widgets to write applications, and this toolkit is IMHO uncomparable to MS-W, because it is much more wellorganized and features alot of goodies more than the MS-W interface.

comp.windows.x	 I am creating a graphics program using the Athena widgets. I use Xlib routines to install a custom Graphics Contex by obtaining the display, and window variables with the XtWindowOfObject() and XtDisplayOfObject(). The object was one of the sub widgets. The problem occurs that whenever a button is pressed or a menu is selected the graphic contex reverts to the orginal one. I tried moving the allocation of the graphic context before the allocation of the buttons but nothing changed. I am preforming all of this manipulation before calling XtAppMainLoop(). 
comp.windows.x	 I have the same problem. I have looked at Motif++, WWL, InterViews, GINA++, and a few variations on the above. I've also done a cursory examination of Rogue Wave's View.h++. I like View.h++'s abstractions best of all of the toolkits I mentioned, but the resulting code looks little like Motif, and I have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result in significant longevity for my code. GINA++ allows you to write code which looks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance, but the resulting code is almost too Motif-like, and is certainly not significantly less verbose than equivalent C code. InterViews looks promising, but I haven't found a free version with Motif support, and I'm not confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted, and what (if any) specific Motif support will be available over time. The other libraries produce code which is less Motif-like, but which does not make sufficient use of the features of C++ to simplify my coding task. 
comp.windows.x	 I've been hearing rumblings about Fresco, and it sounds like it may be what I'm looking for, but how far is it from release, or at least some kind of availability? How similar is it to InterViews? If I code to InterViews, will my code work with Fresco? How about Motif? I've heard some mention of versions of InterViews which support Motif. Will it be feasible to use Motif with Fresco?

I copied all the X stuff that I compiled on my 4/280 (which runs SunOS 4.1.1) using gcc 2.1, and most things run just fine. however, I did find a couple of bugs, and when I try to recompile those clients on the IPX (which runs 4.1.3), I get 
comp.windows.x	 Seeing as Motif has been adopted by Sun, IBM, HP +++ (can't remeber the other members in the recent announcement), I'm sure you'll see it on virtually every workstation (ie. Sun, IBM, HP and DEC must make up the **VAST** majority of all hardware). 
comp.windows.x	 No doubt this is an old question, but I didn't find the answer in the FAQs I could find, so - here goes: 
comp.windows.x	 Mouseless operation is documented in the man pages for olwm and olvwm... However, I can't get it to work in either. I have this line in my .Xdefaults: OpenWindows.KeyboardCommands: Full 
comp.windows.x	 I have a Sparc[12] with a german type 4 keyboard. Has anybody a Patch for X11R5? 
comp.windows.x	 I was wondering if it's possible to change the window icons OLWM uses for things like xterm. Most of the defaults are pretty lame. 
comp.windows.x	 Issue 5 of the X Resource (the published proceedings of the 7th Annual X Technical Conference) has an paper by Mark Linton and Chuck Price titled "Building Distributed interfaces with Fresco". 
comp.windows.x	 If you specify the rootwindow when you are creating your GC. You may use Xlib to draw over multiple windows. I have an application that does something similar for rubber banding. 
comp.windows.x	 I think you will find that the active Linux and 386BSD communities are populated by enthusiasts who would object to paying *any* money for software. Otherwise, they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix. An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community, however, I'm not really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches, C library or compiler patches come out, people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license. Hence, Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView. Individuals may write software requiring Motif, but I doubt it is widely adopted.

comp.windows.x	 I have a peculiar color problem with MacX, Apple's Macintosh X server. I'd like to know if others have seen the same problem. It's happened with the current version (1.2), and with version 1.1.7. When some types of client windows are displayed, parts of the windows are in the wrong color; if the window is moved slightly, forcing the server to repaint it, it is repainted in the correct colors. It doesn't happen for xterm windows, but has happened for graphic windows and with some Motif clients. 
comp.windows.x	 Before I try to teach myself how to write a widget and (perhaps) re-invent the wheel... 
comp.windows.x	 DEC does this only for their PX and PXG servers, known as 3D accelerators. This boards have local offscreen memory which is limited and slow to handle, thus they set this limit. 
comp.windows.x	 Will there be any support for round or circular widgets in Motif's next release?. I'd love to have a circular knob widget which could be used instead of a slider.

comp.windows.x	 Shameless plug -- the Xaw3d widgets make Athena a much nicer alternative than the stock MIT Athena code. 
comp.windows.x	 The simple answer is for you to obtain use XView to do this. XView is a one to one replacement for Sunview. It should already be provided with you Sun running OpenWindows. It is also free available as part of the contrib side of the MIT X11R5 release. 
comp.windows.x	 Let me add another of my concerns: Yes, I can buy a port of Motif for "cheap", but I cannot get the source for "cheap", hence I am limited to using whatever X libraries the Motif port was compiled against (at least with older versions of Motif. I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X, but I have not seen it myself). 
comp.windows.x	 I am looking for a package that implements standard image processing functions (reading/writing from standard formats), clipping, zoom, etc. implemented under X. Both public domain and private packages are of interest. The particular application area I have in mind is medical imaging, but a package meant for a more general context would be acceptable. 
comp.windows.x	 The code fragment looks reasonable, but is your logic valid? Just because something appears in an 8 bit deep pixmap doesn't mean every bit plane contains data. Did you try each plane? 
comp.windows.x	 Yes, and you don't want to change this value if you're running Image type applications. 
comp.windows.x	 I can think of two different methods that you could try. 1) use fork and execv 2) use the "system" called in your program. I'm assuming that you're running under the Unix OS of course. 
comp.windows.x	 We are currently evaluating GUI builders, initially for Motif but with a wish to be flexible & portable. We have been through the popular names (UIMX, TeleUSE, XVT etc) and have been very impressed with what we have seen of Galaxy from Visix. I have spoken to current users from a list supplied by Visix (happy users as you would expect), and seen favourable comments on the net. However, since it is fairly expensive to get an evaluation license from Visix, I would like to query the net for any negative experiences with Galaxy. Did anybody evaluate them and prefer another tool or use Galaxy and regret it or find any mis-features ?

comp.windows.x	 It is actually worse than you think. I have the same problem, and have given up. Emacs has an internal table (somewhere!) which defines what keys it will accept, and this table is system-dependent. I use a Sun from my HP, and cannot get 'shift PageUp' to work - xmodmap is not sufficient, or at least I haven't worked out how to make it work. However, I CAN get ordinary 'PageUp' and 'shift CursorRight' to work, and I do some customised things with them.

comp.windows.x	 I am working on a project to provide an emergency management information system. In keeping with more classic command and control type systems, we are considering developing a dual screen monitor system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor. I have a number of X level questions regarding this: 
comp.windows.x	 Yip, we had the same problem; the only fix we found was to link static some of the clients, ( btw, we used cc). :-(. 
comp.windows.x	 As to how many clients may be display on a server, I believe the limit would be how much memory is available to your server or allocated by the server. 
comp.windows.x	 One can't. The application may not have been started from a terminal emulator; if it was, the terminal emulator may not still exist, and if it does it may be in no condition to be "pop[ped] to the top" (eg, it may be iconified). And even if you can, it may not do what you want - consider a virtual-root window manager like tvtwm, with the relevant window in a portion of the virtual desktop that's outside the real desktop. 
comp.windows.x	 As applied to servers, the first three are fuzzy terms. "multi-headed" tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors, sometimes even multiple screens even if they're multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg, a Sun with a cg4 display). "multi-screen" and "multi-display" would, if taken strictly, mean different things, but since the strict meaning of "multi-display" would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and pointers, when it's used it probably refers to the same thing "multi-screen" would: a system that provides multiple Screens. 
comp.windows.x	 No. Even if you could, the answer could be out of date even before you get it (even if you grab the server, it could be taken up by buffering user actions). You should just try to do whatever you want; a BadAlloc error is your indication that insufficient server memory is available. 
comp.windows.x	 I recently found the file xgolf on a German ftp site (reseq.regent.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de) but unfortunately the shar file was incomplete and the author's email address given in the readme file (markh@saturn.ee.du.edu) does not work. 
comp.windows.x	 I have the exact same problem when running Hewlett Packard's Microwave Design System (MDS) from an HP 380 unix box and running MacX 1.2, Sys 7.0.1*. Normally, MDS draws a window with a deep blue backround, but occasionally it becomes a light blue and all the text, etc, inside the window become "washed out" (nearly invisible). I thought that it was just something brain dead that I was doing or a subtle conflict with another app or INIT. 
comp.windows.x	 I would suggest skipping olwm and getting olvwm instead. This version of the olwm window manager implements a virtual desktop that I find really handy even on large monitors. 
comp.windows.x	 I caught up a mailmessage from an NCD guy, who stated that Tek might be quitting it's X terminal activities and would be looking for an interested buyer. Since the source of this message is NCD, THIS MIGHT ONLY BE NASTY GOSSIP !!! Can anyone say more about this?? 
comp.windows.x	 The XDM on Solaris 2.1 *WAS* broke. Since two weeks, Sun distributes a patched release, which works fine (supports /etc/shadow and all). We have it up and running ever since and have not experienced any problems. Call your local Sun rep.

comp.windows.x	 We've been using it for a year on Unix (Sun and HP) and Windows platforms. In my opinion, it is the best toolkit on the market. It supports a rich API to a high level IPC mechanism, file system abstraction, memory management, command driven application development, drawing, geometry management, and, oh yeah, Open Look, Motif, MS-Windows and Mac (at the flip of a switch). 
comp.windows.x	 I've gotten very few posts on this group in the last couple days. (I recently added it to my feed list.) Is it just me, or is this group near death?

comp.windows.x	 I'd like to compile X11r5 on a Sony NWS-1750 running NEWS 4.1c. The X distribution has support for this config, and the release notes say it has been tested on the machine. BUT, also in the release notes, nothing from Sony is listed under the supported servers. What am I supposed to use for my r5 X server then? How can the OS be supported, but not the hardware? Is there something in the r4 binaries that can be used as the r5 server? These may seem like silly questions, but I'm *really* confused. 
comp.windows.x	 Here's what I (think) have figured out. All I need to do is install the R5 disitribution without the Xserver like the sony.cf file defines, and all the new libraries, utils, etc., will be installed and my old server from r4 will still work. This will allow me to run Xview 3.0, and have X11r5 up and running. Does the server interface remain the same with all changes made only to the libs? 
comp.windows.x	 What sort of traffic is generated with the X-calls? I am curious to find out the required bandwidth that a link must have if one machine running DV/X is supporting multiple users (clients) and we require adequate response time. Anyone have any ideas ??

comp.windows.x	 Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains Xlib graphics. A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item to be drawn in the Window. This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() (or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the Window is mapped. 
comp.windows.x	 Use a GC with the subwindow_mode attribute set to IncludeInferiors. The default is ClipByChildren. However, beware if any of the children are of a different depth to the parent; the semantics of this are undefined by the protocol.

Does anyone know IF there are compatible sequences for this and what they are ? I would think they are DCS (device control sequence) introduced, but may be a CSI sequence exists, too ? This MUST work on a dxterm (VT and ANSI compatible), it may not work on xterms. 
comp.windows.x	 The short answer seems to be: "I don't". The particular package (wscrawl) seems to reset *all* its defaults if *any* of them are missing from the .Xdefaults file. Once I added the missing ones to the .Xdefaults file, the problem goes away.

comp.windows.x	 Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains Xlib graphics. A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item to be drawn in the Window. This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() (or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles "regular" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care of rendering the new image. Using an expose event handler is a "proper" way to do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is guaranteed to be mapped.

comp.windows.x	 I've been using the xrpc package for about a year now. I believe I got it from export. 
comp.windows.x	 I expect what is going on here is that your colormap is full and, when the new application starts up, it cannot add the colors that it needs to the colormap. It therefore has to pick and choose from the existing colors. This makes it look ugly until it's window gets priority. Then Macx changes the colormap so that the selected app is getting the exact colors it wanted, but now other applications are having to make do with it's colormap. 
comp.windows.x	 Hi. I'm trying to figure out how to make a window manager place the window where the create window command tells it, regardless of what it may think is right. (my application has reason to know better)

comp.windows.x	 What does this have to do with my original question??? I previously stated that I did an XCopyArea of the depth-8 pixmap to the screen just to make sure that my image had data, and it did. This is NOT a problem with expose events, it has to do with XCopyPlane not working!!!

comp.windows.x	 We've developed a number of applications using DevGuide and found it to be a very useful tool. I've been impressed with the level of integration it affords using the connection editor. I love the general ease of use. 
comp.windows.x	 Okay, I looked through the FAQs and didn't see this, but I know its come up before... 
comp.windows.x	 Could someone please send me the postal and email address of Congruent Corporation (and any competitors they may have). 
comp.windows.x	 This design will work but I don't think it can take easily take advantage of expose event redraw optimization; that is, the whole window will be redrawn, not just the area with the new item. 
comp.windows.x	 I have been trying to compile some source code for a mpeg animation viewer for X Windows. I got the code from a ftp site. I have modified the Makefile as they instructed, no errors there. What happens is that I get the following message when everything is going to be linked: 
comp.windows.x	 As we don't get a newsfeed I was wondering whether there was such a thing as a Xt mailing list (other than xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu). I would appreciate any info on this, (or X related mailing lists.) 
comp.windows.x	 The shell is waiting for the window-manager to respond to its positioning request. The window-manager is not responding because it thinks the window is already in the right place. 
comp.windows.x	 Does XDM work with DECnet? I have an Ultrix machine running both TCP/IP and DECnet. I have a number of X-terminals hanging off the Ultrix host also running TCP/IP and DECnet. Presently I am using XDM for the login procedure on the X-terminals using TCP/IP. Since XDM is basically just an X-windows client, shouldn't I be able to run XDM on the DECnet protocol tower as well? 
comp.windows.x	 Well, the first 2 are easy. You need the math library. Try adding -lm after -lX11. Don't know if that's the whole problem but it's a start. 
comp.windows.x	 I am currently attempting to get a copy of the HP Widget set compiled under Linux (SLS Release with kernel 99.6) and am running into some problems. Actually, it seems that this is more of a GCC question, because I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS/6000. Basically, there are a number of functions with prototypes set up in, let's say, CompositeP.h, for instance, the composite widget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type : 
comp.windows.x	 I recently compiled the X11R5pl22 sources using gcc-2.3.3 on a Sun3/80. Everything seems to work fine. Usually. But at seemingly random times the server will just hang. I will click the mouse somewhere (never happens while my back is turned), and without warning, it will freeze there, requiring the server to be killed. Sometimes it will run fine for weeks, sometimes only for minutes. 
comp.windows.x	 I've heard about that Italian guy distributing Motif binaries for 386BSD, but I haven't heard of anybody doing the same thing for Linux. ... and I do follow the Linux news group pretty closely. So, have I missed something? I'd LOVE to get hold of Motif libs for Linux for $100! 
comp.windows.x	 I've just managed to get xdm running from an NCR 3000 (an SVR4 486 box running XFree86 1.2) to my NCD XDisplay. It's pretty much working, but I'm encountering a weird error. I'm attempting to start an xterm from my .xsession file, but nothing happens. Redirecting stderr to a file using 'exec 2$HOME/.xerrors' in .xsession reveals the error message: 
comp.windows.x	 I had this problem as well - It had to do with the CG6 graphics card that comes with the IPX. What fixed the problem for me was to apply the "sunGX.uu" that was part of Patch #7. Patch #1 also used this file so perhaps you didn't apply the one that came with Patch #7. 
comp.windows.x	 You can get the ApplicationContext associated with a widget by calling XtWidgetToApplicationContext. 
comp.windows.x	 Anyone know how an application can retrieve the name of the font from an application given an XFontStruct *? Would XGetFontProperty work if I passed XA_FONT_NAME? anyone know details of this? Thanks in advance. Brian 
comp.windows.x	 dale I found an oddity with our SGI Indigo (MIPS R3000 chip). dale When xlock +nolock is running, and I am working remotely dale or in batch (at) mode, the runtime of my programs (as timed dale by using clock() in the code itself) is ~25% slower than if dale xlock is NOT running. No other processes seem to affect my dale runtimes, yet this is very consistent! 
comp.windows.x	 Are we talking about an xterm which would accept the same escape sequences as that for VT340 (or colour decterm/dxterm)? I thought that was called colxterm (and my testing of it shows some oddities that might be bugs or might be my program going wrong). 
comp.windows.x	 I am having a problem with the high order bit of a character being clipped when entered in an xterm window under motif. I have reprogrammed the F1 key to transmit a <ff <be character sequence by using the following line in .Xdefaults: 
comp.windows.x	 Yes, it's possible... in fact, there's some gl widget code in /usr/lpp/GL somewhere... (it's named Glib.c; my IBM's down right now though, so I can't find the exact location :) 
comp.windows.x	 Could some kind soul point me in the right direction for the FAQ list for this group. 
comp.windows.x	 Where did you hear this? If it is printed in a book somewhere, throw away the book. According to the MIT specs, only the first 2 are true. 
comp.windows.x	 How can I get the font family, weight and slant from an instance of a widget? Using initFontContext(), getNextFont() and freeFontContext() I can get the size of the font (and a bunch of other stuff concerning the font) but nowhere have I found family, weight and slant. Assume that I do not have access to the source where family, weight and slant were orginaly used when creating a fontlist. Thanks a bunch and have a great day, Carl carl@softsolut.com 
comp.windows.x	 The oclock widget was written using the SHAPE extension. You can do the same in your widgets. Few current widgets support SHAPE, so you'll have to subclass them to add that functionality. 
comp.windows.x	 There is a widget already defined for GL. It is the GlxMDraw (motif) or GlxDraw (athena) widget. It is similar to a XmDrawingArea, except that it allows you to use GL calls to render into the window. Look at glxlink, glxunlink, glxgetconfig, and glxwinset in the man pages. 
comp.windows.x	 Environment: X11R4 Motif 1.1.4 Sun IPC 4.1.3 
comp.windows.x	 What it has to do with your original question is this: many times beginning X users (heck, experienced X users too!) write small test programs. Many times they forget to draw only in response to expose events, and thus see unpreditable results whereby sometimes the application's graphics show up, and sometimes they don't. We're just trying to eliminate all the "easy" explanations for why you're not seeing your graphics. 
comp.windows.x	 How can I obtain public information (documentation and sources) about Xservers implemented with graphics processors? 
comp.windows.x	 Okay, that's good. I'm typing this from exactly the same setup. (US-UNIX layout keyboard) I did install the sunkbd patch, though. 
comp.windows.x	 Dear SGI and netter GL-X Mixed-Model experts, I am writing a mixed model application that creates a couple different color maps for different windows, and I've been having trouble getting the window manager to reliably honor my requests. In some environments (entry level R3000 Indigo w/ 4.0.5) all windows are getting properly connected to their designated color maps, but on others (an IRIS 4D 240/GTX; also a different entry level Indigo) the color mapping is unreliable and changes behavior when I compile at different times. The most common problem is that all non-top-level windows fail to be displayed according to their colormap. My application starts out by creating three top-level windows; in some cases all but the first of these also fail to be displayed by their colormap. This is spectacularly aggravating. 
comp.windows.x	 According to the OSF/Motif Style Guide, one should use cursor shapes to give the user a visual clue of what is happening or what is expected of him. So a "hourglass" cursor should be shown when the application is busy, or a "caution" cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected in another. Defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level. So defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certain subpart of it, is a rather complicated matter. When cursors have been defined for some windows, e.g. a "crosswire" cursor for a DrawingArea, things get even more complicated. My intuition says that things should be easier, but is this so? If anyone has a solid and complete solution to my problem, please let me know. The topics on "busy cursors" in the several FAQ's are not helpful, since they only work for applications where all windows have the cursor window attribute set to 'None'. 
comp.windows.x	 I am trying to find out if my application is running on a local or a remote display. A local display being connected to the same system that the client is executing on. I have access to the display string but can I tell from the string? 
comp.windows.x	 Some time back I asked for software recommendations to allow me to run X from my PC at home to my Sparc at the office. 
comp.windows.x	 I have a Sun 3/60 that has a mono framebuffer (bwtwo0 ?) built on the motherboard. The same system also has a cgfour (cgfour0 and bwtwo1 ?) daughterboard. I have been using this system with a color monitor having a color "front" screen from the cgfour, and a mono "back" screen from the bwtwo1, both on the same tube. I recentley picked up a 1600 x 1280 Sun mono monitor, and I would like to make a two headed system with the cgfour0 and the bwtwo0. I do not care if I loose the "back" screen on the color tube from the bwtwo1. After looking through the Xsun man page I am not sure if this is possible. Has anybody sucessfuly done this before? 
comp.windows.x	 The COSE announcement specifies that Motif will become the common GUI. But what does this mean exactly? 
comp.windows.x	 The situation: running a Fortran executable that creats an Xterm. An option in the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creats a Tektronics-mode Xterm for displaying some graphics. Typing a <RET while the Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be "Tek-term") is active makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus to the Xterm (I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the Tek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top of Xterm. If what I'm describing isn't input focus, let me know.) 
comp.windows.x	 If you need speed, and your client can run on the same host as the X server, you should use the shared memory extension to the sample X server (MIT-SHM). xdpyinfo will tell you if your server has this extension. This is certainly available with the sample MIT X server running under SunOS. A word of warning: make sure your kernel is configured to support shared memory. And another word of warning: OpenWindows is slower than the MIT server. I have written an imaging tool (using XView for the GUI, by the way) which yields over 10 frames per second for 512*512*8 bit images, running on a Sparc IPC (half the cpu grunt of an IPX). This has proved quite sufficient for animations. 
comp.windows.x	 1. You need these resources : XTerm*EightBitInput: true XTerm*EightBitOutput: true 
comp.windows.x	 Some one asked me recently why they when they used XQueryBestCursor to see if they could create of a given size it seemed to imply they could, but the server did not create cursors of that size. Investigation showed that some X servers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window, while others return some fixed limit of more reasonable size. The interesting thing to me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware - a Sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursors up to root window size are OK, while a Sun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32. So far I've also seen this behavior on NCD and Phase-X X terminals and have been told it also occurs on HPs. Actually, the NCD is even more liberal - sizes much larger then the root winodw are gladly returned as OK. Is XQueryBestCursor semi-broken or is this behavior correct? I'd really like to see a 2000x2000 cursor! 
comp.windows.x	 XDM is not just an X Window client. XDM has its own protocol (XDMCP) that operates of UCP on port 177. It does provide a Login window which is an X Window Client. As to using DECnet protocol. Looking through the source for XDM from X11R5 that I have here, it seems that the bare bones code is there but not completely there. 
comp.windows.x	 If anyone has any information about the existence or location of a dedicated X server kernel for the Sun3, please send email. I am trying to put some neglected Sun3s to good use but they don't have enough memory for SunOS 4.1.1. Thanks in advance for any help. 
comp.windows.x	 I am trying to build and use imake (X11R4) on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX V3.2. I am having the following 2 problems. 
comp.windows.x	 Could someone please send me the postal and email address of Congruent Corporation (and any competitors they may have). 
comp.windows.x	 I have a question regarding the processing of program arguments such as the -geometry option. Since this is a standard X option, I'm wondering wether I have to parse it manually or whether there is some predefined function that will do this for me? 
comp.windows.x	 Try change the GXxor to GXequiv. I have to do this for programs that are to run on NCD terminals (on Sun terminals I have to change it back to GXxor)... 
comp.windows.x	 The multi-lingual archives at The Computing Research Labs, New Mexico State University will be moving to a new ftp address soon. The archives are being put under control of the Consortium for Lexical Research. 
comp.windows.x	 Does anyone know what is available in terms of automated testing of X/Motif applications. I am thinking of a system which I could program (or which could record events/output) with our verification test procedures and then run/rerun each time we do regression testing. I am interested in a product like this for our UNIX projects and for a separate project which will be using OpenVMS. 
comp.windows.x	 If it's any consolation, I have two 2-headed Sun-3/60 systems, though the color and mono monitors for each are "rated" 1152x900. Their configuration is the same as yours, so it "should" be a Plug'N'Play situation, EXCEPT: 
comp.windows.x	 It works on xterms. At least I have no problem with it. - Back to the original question: 
comp.windows.x	 Do anyone know about any shading program based on Xlib in the public domain? I need an example about how to allocate correct colormaps for the program. 
comp.windows.x	 Have you gotten an answer yet? Using your variables, this is what I would do: xterm -T "$HOST - $LOGNAME" -n "$HOST" 
comp.windows.x	 I want to press a function key and have a text string appear in an XmText widget. When I put 
comp.windows.x	 Animation is most frequently done by copying the the client resident XImages into server resident Pixmap(s) using XPutImage. Once this is done, the original XImages can be deleted and the animation loop can be performed using XCopyArea from the Pixmaps to the windows drawable. 
comp.windows.x	 A few days ago I posted a question about trying to call a function which set up an X app multiple times. It was pointed out that XtAppInitialize() should never be called more than once. This helped. However, I am still having some problems. Below is a new little test program that more closely models my real program. In the actual program, I am writing a library, callable from any other program. This means that the first time the lib function is called, it must initialize things, and after that, it should just use the old stuff (still around because of static variables). In the demo below, main() represents the main program calling my library and doit() represents the interface to the library function. 
comp.windows.x	 I posted this a while ago and didn't recieve one reply, and now we have another bug report on the same subject. Can anybody help me out? 
comp.windows.x	 I'm an new to this. Having found some files (public) to look into, I ftp'ed them to a system I have access to. I then used kermit to transmit them via modem to my host computer, a PC-based file system. I access internet through modem access to a university mainframe. From the PC file server, I pull the files to a disk, and then pull them from disk to a SGI Indigo (the SGI is not networked yet). When I try to uncompress and un-tar the files, they either come out as garbage or I get an error in the tar process about directories being invalid. What I'm wondering about is the transfer of UNIX files (compressed, binary,ascii) about multiple platforms. My guess is that it is the copy to a 'dos' disk that is screwing things up. Any help is appreciated. bob 
comp.windows.x	 I have two questions (well probably more...) about how Expose & Configure events are handled. 
comp.windows.x	 Hi. I've looked in the FAQ and the O-Reilly books and was unable to find (an easy) means of finding out the state of state keys such as CapsLock and NumLock. I can certainly track the events inside of my window and set a boolean there, but what if CapsLock is pressed in another window? I looked at XGrabKey() and decided it was definitely NOT what I wanted to do. I could find no convenience function to tell me that information. 
comp.windows.x	 Try change the GXxor to GXequiv. I have to do this for programs that are to run on NCD terminals (on Sun terminals I have to change it back to GXxor)... 
comp.windows.x	 I "think" you should try linking to /usr/lib/libXmu.a instead of -lXmu. At least that solved the problem for me! 
comp.windows.x	 If you are using the Intrinsics, it is parsed for you. If you are working at the Xlib level, you can parse it yourself or you can use the following bit of code. 
comp.windows.x	 Thanx, Jeff. You're a lifesaver. I imported the new sun GX emulator that came in with patch #7. The problem has since disappeared. 
comp.windows.x	 Using XPutImage, your source is maintained by the client and the destination is maintained by the server, thus you incur the overhead of transporting through whatever client-server communications mechanism you are using. 
comp.windows.x	 I've installed X11R5 with patches for Solaris 2.1 on our SPARCstation LX / SPARCclassic pool. On the LX, X11R5 runs fine, but on the classics, after giving the command startx, Xsun prints the following messages: WARNING: cg3_mmap: can't map dummy space! Mapping cg3c: No such device or address and exits. 
comp.windows.x	 Are there any vendors supporting pressure sensitive tablet/pen with X? I will appreciate any pointers. 
comp.windows.x	 A question like this is answered in the FAQ, about sharing X windows. One of the answers is XTrap, a record and playback extenstion to X. You can find it at export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/XTrapV33_X11R5.tar.Z. 
comp.windows.x	 I don't know if this might help, but I've just started playing with a program called POVRay (Persistance of Vision Raytracer) that also displays its output via X Windows. It does a fairly good job of allocating the colormap on my Psuedo-Color 8-plane display. I got the source from from a site in Canda. The person I retrieved them from was David Buck (dbuck@ccs.carleton.ca). 
comp.windows.x	 What "it may think is right" may be exactly what the user wants. Assuming that your application "has reason to know better" is, IMHO, anti-social. If I start your application with a -geometry option are you going to ignore that as well? 
comp.windows.x	 You are right but PLEASE DON'T DO THIS. It makes my brain hurt. USPosition and USSize should ONLY be set if the USER specified the position and size. 
comp.windows.x	 Doug NNTP-Posting-Host: se05.wg2.waii.com I am having a big problem trying to build MIT X11R5 with xlc 1.2.1 (the one bundled with AIX 3.2.3e). Its almost the linker is not working properly with shared libraries. 
comp.windows.x	 I just had an idea. I'm not sure if its been done and I'm just remembering it unconsiously, but I thought that in dialog boxes and whatever in windowing systems, there should be a way to intuitivly set some things checked or unchecked or filled in a certain way. My idea: tape. You know, like putting a piece of tape over a light switch? Just an idea, if you like it, use it. 
comp.windows.x	 Where can I get xman source? I would like to get the binaries for xman for an HP 9000/700, but I would settle for source. 
comp.windows.x	 Okay, I got such great response from my last question (thanks, everyone), lets try again: 
comp.windows.x	 I don't know anything about a "sunkbd" patch, but I use the following .Xmodmap file (run from .xinitrc via "xmodmap $HOME/.Xmodmap", of course) for my Type-5 UNIX keyboard: (It's a bit "brute force", however.) 
comp.windows.x	 Version 1.0 of NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System, a networked information systems and World Wide Web browser, is hereby released: 
comp.windows.x	 There is a free program called 'xkernel' which does just that. It is by Seth Robertson (seth@ctr.columbia.edu). It takes a sun 3 and boots a limited kernel which allows you to run X. We converted 4 machines over this semester and the speedup is enormously appreciable -- I find them faster than an NCD 15inch black&white XTerminal that we are playing with, and a bigger screen to boot! As a matter of fact, the department just bought some old sun3s at an auction to convert! 
comp.windows.x	 I think you tried to send me a message re: the animation query If you can remember what you typed, I'd appreciate another attempt! 
comp.windows.x	 I just implemented this and it seems I can just about achieve the display rates (20 400x400x8 frames / sec on IPX) that I get with Sunview, though it's a bit "choppy" at times. Also, loading the data, making an XImage, then XPut'ing it into a pixmap is a bit cumbersome, so the animation is slower to load than with Sunview. Is there a better way to load in the data? 
comp.windows.x	 I'm running X under openwindows 3. Normal X programs not having a font specified always show up in the same font - until I change the fontpath, and restart windows - then a new default font is used until the next change. I can't seem to figure out how it chooses. Is there some way to set this? Possibly something in .Xdefaults??? 
comp.windows.x	 Sorry, but olwm and tvtwm don't do it. They place the title at that position and the window at a position below it. 
comp.windows.x	 Usually when I start up an application, I first get the window outline on my display. I then have to click on the mouse button to actually place the window on the screen. Yet when I specify the -geometry option the window appears right away, the properties specified by the -geometry argument. The question now is: 
comp.windows.x	 The protocol has to move the whole image from process memory to server memory, this is the hog. The conversions in the XPutImage() are fast. 
comp.windows.x	 HI, I am looking for an X app that will display dxf files. These are ascii text files that are normally associated with autocad. I have a large 9 meg. file of the state of wisconsin that i would like to views and or cut into smaller chunks. 
comp.windows.x	 If a X-window package exists, that runs om PC, DOS (and maybe MS-windows) I would be very happy to hear about it. 
comp.windows.x	 A colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new MIPS workstation. When he first logs on (via xdm), he has a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager running. In this configuration, X windows applications (particularly xdvi) work fine. However, if he opens up a second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window, giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font. 
comp.windows.x	 I have a problem when I'm using PostScript. When I am working local on a SUN SPARCstaton IPC the PostScript works good, but when I connect to the SUN from a X-terminal I just get error messages that the PostScript cannot connect to the news-display. 
comp.windows.x	 keep tabs with the FAQ in sci.image.processing. There is quite a comprehensive compilation of image processing s/w (X included). I've ftp'ed ImageMagick and its great. Check out the FAQ its all there. 
comp.windows.x	 The problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators, and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply. Unfortunately, the specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined with other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case: "Ctrl Any<Keyq". 
comp.windows.x	 The MIT tapes come with documentation written by Keith Packard on the Shared Memory Extension to X. Look in: mit/doc/extensions/mit-shm.ms I found this invaluble. Unfortunately, there is a bit of work to set up the shared memory segments, making an XImage from it, etc. Also, there is an extension query to determine if the server supports it, but you still need to test if the server is running on the same host and if shared memory is enabled in the kernel. I have written layers of convience routines which make all this transparent. As for the XView code, well, I doubt that would be considered interesting. The interesting stuff is done in a C object library. People interested in this code can Email me. 
comp.windows.x	 I need help binding some value to the HOME and END keys on my keyboard. I have an rs/6000 w/ aix3.2.3ext running X11R5pl19 mit dist. I'm using a PC running eXceed for windows as my xterminal. The HOME and END keys do not send a value, and my application needs them to be defined. I used this in my Xdefaults to define the keys: 
comp.windows.x	 We are getting a memory fault and a core dump whenever we end a Motif session under Ultrix 4.3, running on a DEC 5000/240. An examintion of the core file leads us to believe it's from getcons. Does anyone know what this is all about? 
comp.windows.x	 Thanks for docs info. It turns out that if I leave out colormap updates between frames and use tvtwm, my tests with 100 400x400x8 frames on an IPX using the server-resident pixmap method give an astonishing *50* frames per second! And VERY smooth. I think I've found the best solution (thanks to the generous help on this group!) However, I may have colormap questions later..... 
comp.windows.x	 There's documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in the X11R5 distribution. 
comp.windows.x	 I want to be able to send a Pixmap from one client to the next. Along with this I want to send the Colormap and foreground and background pixel values. So far not a problem, I can do this with no problem. 
comp.windows.x	 I consider TWM-style Squeezed Titles indispensable in a window manager. I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same time, with no overlap; and since two windows aren't enough, I have other xterm windows underneath them, with exactly the same positioning. 
comp.windows.x	 There is no easy answer to this question: it depends on whether the display device can hold pixmaps in off-screen memory, and if so, how efficiently the server manages these resources (having to deal with limited off-screen memory is the bane of the server implementor's existence!). 
comp.windows.x	 Hi Xperts! I have a Sparc-1 with very limited disk space on /usr partition. previously, i was able to run all x-windows applications and then i upgraded my system to sun o.s. 4.1.3 and realized that , the hard disk did not have enough space to load openwindows. My immediate alternative was to load only the neccessary files to boot the system. This resulted in not loading openwindows. As a result of which none of the X-libraries got loaded. 
comp.windows.x	 The reason they place their outside corner at the location you requested is because that's what the ICCCM says they should do. 
comp.windows.x	 Because xterminals do not have a NeWS server. xterminals have speed by nature of their limited functionality: once you add NeWS and everything else, you have a workstation. There are workarounds, I've heard, one involving a perl script. What we are trying to do is replace programs that need NeWS (like pageview) with programs that don't (like ghostview). Maybe someone else can elaborate on the perl workaround; I have no personal experience with it. 
comp.windows.x	 I have an applicationShell which uses a colormap created with XCreateColormap() and uses all of the colors available for my 8-bit display. When I move the cursor over the window I get the "Technicolor Effect" - which is fine. Basically, my program works. 
comp.windows.x	 Subject says it all... Anyone know where I can find one. Binaries are nice, but source would do to. 
comp.windows.x	 Hi, I have a problem when compiled Wcl 2.02 in SCO ODT 2.0: 
comp.windows.x	 I'm looking for a version of xterm which handles color and vt220 style status lines. Can anyone out there help? 
comp.windows.x	 When I run our RS6000's "info" utility through a remote login shell (rlogin) from my Sun Sparc 1+, I can no longer type lower case in any of info's window prompt's. 
comp.windows.x	 I find this thread on motif accelerators absoultly amazing. If I were writing an interface to keyboard accelerators, I would have one resource called "accelerators" that took a translation table, period. I would also implement it so that programmer never has to do any work to get the accelerators installed. As soon as the end-user specified one, it would be active and automatically installed. 
comp.windows.x	 Correct. Most X servers use a version of malloc(3) which will not return memory to the OS (ie. the X server might free(3) a Pixmap, but the heap does not shrink). 
comp.windows.x	 Well, after massaging the Dec.cf, osf.def, (can't remember the exact names) from OSF into my normal X11R5 distribution, everything compiles and links fine, but xterm doesn't run. 
comp.windows.x	 I am writing a custom widget to support the display of graphics and imagery. The user of the widget will be able to specify, when creating it, whether it is to operate in X or GL mode. 
comp.windows.x	 I am using the GLX widget + athena widgets on a mixed-model application, under 4Dwm, but when the dialog gets popped up, its text entry field does not have focus. Aimilar code works perfectly if I use "pure X" (no mixed-model). HEre is the relevant portion of the code.

comp.windows.x	 Hear! Hear! I agree completely. One thing I can't stand about the Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use the mouse(what if your mouse breaks--your whole system is down!). I like the mouse--it is handy on some occassions such as cut and past and moving icons around, etc. But for most work, the keyboard and hot keys are 10-20 times faster than using the mouse. Sure it is a plus to be able to do something simple if you are an inexperienced user, but how long is it before your are experienced? A month? Two? (Speaking of PCs at the moment.)' "I don't think it is too much to ask that window programmers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but also look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and command line interfaces, which usually allows you to do more in less time IF you are experienced. All of the above equally applies to windowing systems on UNIX (especially since Unix is at least 500% more powerful than DOS).

comp.windows.x	 You'll have to check the keysym(s) on each of the keys for each modifier. The one with NumLock in its mapping is the modifier you want. A bit ugly perhaps but I think its currently the only way to do this (and it does have some precedent as keysyms are used to differentiate CapsLock from ShiftLock for the Lock modifier). 
comp.windows.x	 i am in need of a motif-based graphing package to integrate into a large software package under development for distribution to universities. it can be either public domain or commercial, although a commercial package can't have royalties required for binary only distribution. we need 2-d graphing capabilities at a minimum, but 3-d would be nice. any info would be appreciated and i will summarize if there is interest.

comp.windows.x	 Unfortunately, the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into emacs. I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to change the source code so that all of these special keys generated character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier state as escape sequences -- for example, the sequence "ESC [ 1 B 7" would indicate that the "HOME" key was pressed, with the shift key down. You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, such as "shift-Return".

comp.windows.x	 Hi folks Thanks to the ones that replied, however, my problem turned out to be very simple. 
comp.windows.x	 Can someone point me in the direction of any papers (not necessarily formally conducted studies) discussing how much traffic X apps generate for the network, particularly in comparison with curses-bases apps over telnet? Also, does an X server typically buffer up user keyboard input a line at a time? Can the X client control this, asking for keystrokes immediately? Thanks in advance for any feedback! 
comp.windows.x	 I think the original post was searching for existing implementations of f.i. Gouroud-shading of triangles. This is fairly complex to do with plain X. Simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archie where to get the latest version). For Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension only, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window with it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable 'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(), what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes or such stuff.

comp.windows.x	 Hello-- I'm currently designing the architecture of a chip which is intended to help speed up common operations on a windowing system such as X. A friend and I are designing the chip as the final course project for an advanced computer architecture course taught by Dr. Fred Brooks at UNC-Chapel Hill. While we feel that we've got a pretty solid design currently, we'd really like to get ahold of some frequency data from an X-Windows server so that we can make the most effective use of our bit budget. 
comp.windows.x	 I *think* this is correct behavior. Remember the default colormapFocusPolicy is keyboard (meaning the cmap focus follows the keyboard focus). Since the dialog is modal, mwm won't allow keyboard focus onto your main shell, and so it won't allow cmap focus either. 
comp.windows.x	 I am considering making a reasonably large application for free distribution (probably copylefted). I am going to use X. Now I'm bewildered by the huge number of "standards" that "open systems" has created.

comp.windows.x	 Tcpview is the result of several problems we had at UW. We have several Network General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on several hundred subnets. These are good tools, but they are 1) heavy, 2) hard to find when you need one, 3) limited in their software expandibility, 4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis, 5) cannot be remotely operated, and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS, requiring much manual manipulation of the name table. We also sometimes use tcpdump, but we found it 1) too difficult for most people, 2) did not have enough information for many protocols, 3) could not be used interactively, 4) could not handle TCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files. However, tcpdump did do a reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols, and could be easily modified. Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems by adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features. 
comp.windows.x	 We developed a toolkit running on the X Window System. The toolkit copes with any languages based on X11R5's i18n facility. As you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT's X11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkit uses Xsi.

comp.windows.x	 As I've said before, there's no reliable way to find out the size of the window manager decoration. If your window has been reparented, you can't assume that the window you're parented to is the window that holds all of the window manager decoration. There may be several layers of windows. Doing multiple XQueryTree's until you get to the root will work in most cases, but there's no guarantee that the outside decoration window is parented to the root window of the display (tvtwm).

comp.windows.x	 No, it isn't. It is the "X Window System", or "X11", or "X" or any of a number of other designations accepted by the X Consortium. In fact, doing "man X" on pretty much any X11 machine will tell you: 
comp.windows.x	 I'm just guessing here, but I'd guess that X11R5 expects the CG3 to have 1152x900 resolution, and the version of the CG3 in the SPARCclassic is 1024x768.

comp.windows.x	 The version I have is using the x256q code instead of the default X Windows code. I have it currently running on a DEC Alpha running OpenVMS AXP and so far have been pretty impressed.

comp.windows.x	 Does anybody have an X server for NT that they're willing to share files or experiences? 
comp.windows.x	 We have an old Sun3/60 here which gets occasional use. When X11R5 is started on it any console messages during startup are undeletable. After X is fully started we run an xterm as the "console" - the problem is that any messages that arrive before this starts go to the plain console. "Refresh window" fails to remove them. The messages are a real pain since they sit in the middle of the screen obscuring anything else below them. 
comp.windows.x	 Even 24Bit TrueColor machines are in most cases running an emulated 8 bit PseudoColor visual, only to get standard x clients, motif apps and thelike to run. I strongly suppose you to emulate at least:

I have been unable to locate the administrator of this list. 
comp.windows.x	 Depends on the nature of the "rounding." X allows the user to do bit arithmetic on pixel values, (i.e., XOR foreground and backgroun pixel values together to calculate a foreground color that when used with a function of GXxor fill change foreground to background and vice-versa). If your rounding does not preserve these types of calculations then clients that use them will break.

comp.windows.x	 This may be an FAQ, but I dont know where to get the FAQ list! My OpenLook application has a few buttons. The first button turns red(gets highlighted?) as soon as the sprite(mouse) is moved into the application window. How do I suppress this? 
comp.windows.x	 I used to think this way, and not just about X. For example, incorrect English constructs such as "its raining" or "it's window id" annoy me. However, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWS was really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technically superior as well!). 
comp.windows.x	 We have a program written with X11R5 and Motif 1.2.1. It runs fine on the Sun X11R5 server and MacX. When that program is run under the Sparc 2 and the OW server, the program crashed itself along with the server. It crashed before the first window had showed up.

comp.windows.x	 I have noticed in FrameMaker 3.1X on both the SGI and SUN platforms that certain dialogs, such as "Column Layout..." for example, respond to keyboard traversal even though the pointer is NOT in the dialog window and even though the window manager keyboard focus policy is POINTER. 
comp.windows.x	 I'm writing an application running under X (using Motif), and I need to do some stuff when the application quits. Now, when I shut down my X Windows session, it doesn't seem to send a SIGTERM (or whatever) signal to my application (I'm trapping various signals like that). Therefore, I thought I could use an X signal to check for my top level window being destroyed.

comp.windows.x	 Concurrent has a product called RealTimeX (tm) that is a set of real-time extensions to the X Window System. RealTimeX is currently supported on the Concurrent Series 7000 and Series 8000 with the GA5000 graphics accelerator. If you need/want more info, let me know. 
comp.windows.x	 For image display, about 10 frames per second seems to be the lower limit for interactive operations. For just bringing up an image for viewing less than 1 second seems to be a good number. Of course the measure of response time should be based on the applications you are planning to run. 
comp.windows.x	 X Window installation on a Sun4/470 with CG6 alone and with CG2 as screen:0.0 and CG6 as screen:0.1. 
comp.windows.x	 The 4-bit server should work fine. As far as I know, Xterminals running older versions can run the latest apps as long as the host machine has the R5 libraries installed. I could be wrong though. 
comp.windows.x	 I'm trying to create a button that has both a label and a bitmap using the MenuButton widget. Is this possible? Right now, all I get is the bitmap -- no sign of the label. 
comp.windows.x	 Well I can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the significant drop in price year after year. The link I want to use though (ISDN 64K) is costly and the bandwidth limited. That's why my interest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic goes through it. 
comp.windows.x	 No, not another false alarm, not a "It'll certainly be done by *next* week" message... No, this is the real thing. I repeat, this is *not* a drill! 
comp.windows.x	 w/o actually executing it? somehow one of my xterminal users has made it so that a click of MB3 (right) automatically kills all clients - oh my :-( 
comp.windows.x	 i read about the code you can put in to most applications so that the virtual desktop stuff in tvtwm doesn't confuse them (or is the application confusing the virtual-ness? [chicken & the egg?] 
comp.windows.x	 Does anyone know of an X server for character cell terminals? Doesn't have to be anything fancy, as long is it works. 
comp.windows.x	 I don't know any way except to see what modifiers are on in th Keypress event. Of course if there is some reason why you need to always know the state of modifiers even if your windows don't have the keyborads focus you can always ask for KeyPress events from the root window. Then you get all the KeyPresses and you always know what have been pressed.

misc.forsale	 Good point, but I was just thinking.. I wanted to sell my HP28sx calculator here in this newsgroup...

misc.forsale	 Hey! I am interested in buying a digital delay pedal, preferably capable of sampling and infinite repeat. (If you're familiar with Phil Keaggy, I want to mimic, or at least as close as possible, what he does in concert, i.e., click the pedal, play something, click it again, and what he played between clicks repeats infinitely while he playes leads over it) Anyway, let me know..... 
misc.forsale	 Just to inform the readers of newsrc Sony has just introduced a new DATman, the TCD-D7 which is smaller and less expensive than the D3. Also, the D7 has a coaxial jack which the D3 lacks. Oh, the D3 has always been available through mail-order houses for less than $700 dollars new... with the new model coming out, I suspect the now obsolete D3 will be selling for even less.

misc.forsale	 I'll third the opinion about this outfit/franchise.

I will never use a mailing service unless I don't have the right box and the buyer needs whatever IMMEDIATELY. I'll also tell the person, if they agreed to pick up shipping, what is going on. 
misc.forsale	 I am cleaning out the coffers. I have a virtually MINT collection of HEAVY METAL magazine. This is NOT a music mag but the really neato mag with Giger and Moebius artwork, et al.

misc.forsale	 IMHO, it seems to be worth the $40 to upgrade. DoubleSpace seems a bit saner than Stacker 2.0 (which I've replaced). MemMaker is nowhere near as aggressive as QEMM, but it doesn't hose my system like QEMM did (at least it hasn't yet). Microsoft AntiVirus is just the latest version (or a reasonably recent one) of CPAV - mine was very aged, so this was quite welcome.

Similarly, there are people who wanted the advertised catalog who aren't happy with the junk they got instead.

misc.forsale	 I participated a promotion by a company called Visual Images. They sent me a award certificate three months ago and asked me to buy their promotion package in order to receive the major award. They mislabled my address and I did not receive my package until one month ago. I was mad and angry about how it took them so long to get my package. So I wrote them a letter and requested for a refund. They never return my letter. I was lucky enough to find out their telephone number through operator and received the package. I immediately returned the package and wrote them another letter to ask for refund. The package was returned because they address they put on the package was incorrect. I attempted to call them and learnd that they have changed their telephone number. It took me at least 10 phone calls to find out their new number, but they refused to take any responsibility. I spoke to their manager and she said she would call me back, but she has not call yet. But I was able to get their address from their front desk. Should I just go ahead and send the package? Or should I waite until they call me back?

misc.forsale	 I'm sure that the Motorola is worth it, but this kind of thing has always mystified me. $400 is the price of very good, new dual-band, fully synthasized HT. Yes, yes, I know Motorola HTs are bullet-proof, unbreakable, plutonium-based indestructable -- you can drive a tank over them and they'll still work. But just how often does that come up? Why are hams willing (and they *are*) to spend the price of a synthaszied dual-bander for a 2-channel xtal rig??? Note: this is not a flame; as I said, I'm sure this is a good deal for this rig. I'm just amazed that it *is* a good deal. I would have guessed that a 2 channel xtal rig could never be worth as much as a dual- bander to a ham, no matter how durable. Just shows you how wrong *I* can be. 
misc.forsale	 Well, Dale, I'd say offhand "Keel-hauling" would work pretty well...we haven't had a good "keel-hauling" in a long time...

Or maybe just ask for folks to flood the guys mailbox with the FAQ for net-etiquitte...sort of poetic justice for all the junk mail he was trying to generate anyway...

Or if it the seller allows for a personal check to be used on a COD it's fine till a stop payment is made. There are few methods to protect both buyer and seller in any sort of transaction. Even with merchants and customers there are problems...stolen credit cards, chargebacks, no return policies and getting the wrong item, etc.

rec.autos	 Say, you bought your Saturn at $13k, with a dealer profit of $2k. If the dealer profit is $1000, then you would only be paying $12k for the same car. So isn't that saving money? 
rec.autos	 sure sounds like they got a ringer. the 325is i drove was definitely faster than that. if you want to quote numbers, my AW AutoFile shows 0-60 in 7.4, 1/4 mile in 15.9. it quotes Car and Driver's figures of 6.9 and 15.3. oh, BTW, these numbers are for the 325i. 
rec.autos	 The subject says it all. My 1984 Chev S10 Pickup's left turn signal does not stop after turning. What cause this to stop automaticaly?. Is this a mechanical problem by the steering wheel?. 
rec.autos	 That my be, but every Volvo I've ever owned has lasted far longer than most other cars..... 1981 Volvo 245....125,000 Miles, still on the road. 1983 Volvo 242....195,000 Miles, still on the road. 1984 Volvo 244....175,000 Miles, still on the road. And I'll admit, the dealer repair cost is high. But with some mechanical aptitude of your own, and finding a good indi mechanic, you can avoid most breakdowns, and make the rest cheap(The sum total of the repairs on the car with 195,000 miles has been 2 mufflers and a radiator. Whoa. Bad repair record). And all of these cars are driven fairly hard. None of them are at the head of a line of cars going 30 MPH....the first two spend a lot of their operating life with the speedometer pegged...and the only reason the 84 doesn't is it has a 120 MPH speedo... What I want to know is....have all you people who hate Volvos been traumatized by someone in a 745 Turbo wagon blowing you away on the road, or what? 
rec.autos	 I'm looking for a replacement radio/tape player for a 1984 Toyota Tercel. Standard off-the-shelf unit is fine, but every place I've gone to (Service Merchandise, etc.) doesn't have my car in its model application book. I want to just take out the old radio, and slide in the new, with minimal time spent hooking it up and adjusting the dashboard. 
rec.autos	 I am thinking about getting an Infiniti G20. In consumer reports it is ranked high in many catagories including highest in reliability index for compact cars. Mitsubushi Galant was second followed by Honda Accord). 
rec.autos	 out- accelerate an Integra. 
rec.autos	 Why don't you look again at Motor Trend's, slalom times, they are 67.9, right along with the Integra, and the car does that with small 14 inch tires that are all -weather XGTV4, not to mention that the Integra rides alot better than a Beretta. Your acceleartion times also vary, magazine to magazine Road & Track and Car& Driver have the GS-R at 6.8 to 8.0 for Road and Track. Also Quarter mile times vary from 15.4 to 16.1 You can't tell exactly by the numbers. Furthermore, the Integra will definately outrun the Beretta on the high end. Car & Driver and Road & track have the GS-R doing 136 to 141 mph, and it gets there fast. 
rec.autos	 Any advice on HOW to buy a Land Cruiser? My local Toyota dealer says they get two a year, and if I want one I can just get on the waiting list. Forget about a test drive or even kicking the tires. And if they are that rare, I doubt there is much of a parts inventory on hand. 
rec.autos	 This past winter I drove from NYC to Killington,VT 6 or 7 times in my 1990 325i Convertible (talk about poor reputation in the snow!!) with an EXCELLENT set of snow tires. I put 4 Noika NR10s on in Dec. and have been sure footed in some pretty severe weather conditions ever since. I've plowed through 4 - 5 inch snow covered roads effortlessly, while other cars have been paralyzed (front wheel drive included).

rec.autos	 Any reason you are limited to the two mentioned? They aren't really at the same point along the SUV spectrum - not to mention price range. How about the Explorer, Trooper, Blazer, Montero, and if the budget allows, the Land Cruiser? Bear in mind that 90% of all SUV's purchased never venture off-road. Carefully weigh the trade-off between comfort and off-road performance when choosing one, and realistically decide whether you'll actually make enough use of the off-road-ability to sacrifice (some of) the on-road comfort.

rec.autos	 My sister has an MGB. She has one from the last year they were produced (1978? 1979?). Its in very good shape. I've been bugging her for years about selling it. I've said over and over that she should sell it before the car is worthless while she maintains that the car may actually be increasing in value as a result of its limited availability. 
rec.autos	 This has me thinking. Is there a biological reason why women can't put their keys in their pants pockets like men do? I have two pockets on the back of each of my pants. I put my keys in one and wallent in another. Many of the pockets even have a botton on them so I can close them securely. Everything is that much simpler for me. Why can't women do the same? Is is biological (ie, not enough room for a bigger bottom plus keys and a wallet) or is it the way they are raised by the parents? 
rec.autos	 I was wondering if someone could point me to somewhere I could find a list (and hopefully comparison) of all the convertibles that are out these days. Seems like they are making a big comeback - but I'm not sure where to look 
rec.autos	 Has anybody noticed that Toyota has an uncanny knack for designing horrible ugly station wagons? Tercels, Corollas, Camrys. Have their designers no aesthetic sense at all? 
rec.autos	 Cup holders (driving is an importantant enough undertaking) Cellular phones and mobile fax machines (see above) Vanity mirrors on the driver's side. Ashtrays (smokers seem to think it's just fine to use the road) Fake convertible roofs and vinyl roofs. Any gold trim. 
rec.autos	 One of the local dealers has a used (7k miles) '93 Probe GT on the lot with a photocopy of a document taped to the window saying the dealership bought the car back from the previous owner because of "Engine noises", but that the Ford district rep had OK'ed the car saying those noises were "normal". I thought it was worth looking into (the car seems otherwise clean) and mentioned this to a co-worker, who proceeded to tell me a horror story about her son's '93 Probe GT, which had several problems, ending with engine noises which she said "was something with the heads", that Ford acknowledged the noise, said they were working on it, but didn't have a cure as of yet. Her son traded the car in (and I checked -- not the same car). So I have some evidence of a reoccuring problem with the V6 in the Probe GT's, and by extension with the Madza 626 and MX-6. 
rec.autos	 It's great that all these other cars can out-handle, out-corner, and out- accelerate an Integra.

rec.autos	 Left hand steering wheel placement was not standard until the 20's in the US. Driving on the right has been standard since standards came into being. Interestingly, Chrysler has just begun building right hand drive cars again for export to Japan. 
rec.autos	 DeSoto's first year of manufacture was 1928, so this may indeed have been an export special, as left hand controls were standard here by then.

rec.autos	 Comparing the GTZ and GSR is apples to oranges, somewhat like a Mustang 5.0 and a CRX, both have very different ways of doing things and ought to appeal to different buyers, i.e., I don't think an Acura owner would be seen dead in a Chevy dealership or vice versa. 
rec.autos	 Grass Roots Motorsport [3/93] has a long article about MG/B's this month. As far as collectivity/speculation is concerned they think it is a waste of time, especially the later rubber bumpered models are the least desirable, a 1962 original model the most. The reasons for its low value are easy availability and the fact that it just was not a very good car. 
rec.autos	 KYTo all those who have PASSATs, do you recommend using Super Unleaded or just KYregular Unleaded Gasoline. I have been using Regular Unleaded. A friend of mine has KYa Jetta and has always used Super Unleaded and thinks I should be using the same; KYhowever, I believe the advantages of Super Unleaded for CARs $30000 and under KYhas been overplayed by guess who: the companies who sell them, because that is KYwhere they make the most PROFIT. A Ralph Nader report and other consumer advocates KYhave in the past spoken against those oil companies. 
rec.autos	 toyota has cornered the market on ugly station wagons. after seeing the new camry sedan, i had thought toyota would finally turn out something nice-looking. the new camry station wagon bears a strong resemblance to a hearse, and a weird looking one at that. 
rec.autos	 Your best bet is the Dodge Intrepid with the SOHC 24 valve 3.4? six. it gets 214 hp, and has a hell of a lot of room, great styling, and ABS, with four wheel disk breaks. The LH cars won Automobile magazines "automobile of the year" award, and are quiet impressive. 
rec.autos	 I won't argue too much about anything. I am probably one of those that think that we can't have enough safety on the roads. I would gladly sacrifice distractions (as you call it), than someone having trouble seeing danger earlier. One saved life justifies more than my lifetime of "distractions" for me.

rec.autos	 Yes. But the point is that prices are competetive. Saturn may well be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a $2000 profit, but since a comperable Honda with $500 profit is more expensive, it may be well worth it to buy the Saturn.

rec.autos	 My T-Bird SC's manual says to replace the platinum plugs every 60,000mi. Wal-Mart has Autolite platinum plugs for $2.00 each. Are these "real" platinum plugs? (I had Bosch platinums in my '80 Fiesta and my dad had 'em in his '84 Bronco--note the keyword "had." They didn't last very long (much less than 50,000mi) before they had to be replaced. I agree that they weren't the greatest.) 
rec.autos	 Australians still do drive on the "wrong" side of the road. I believe Sweden changed in 1968. The way I heard it was that they swapped all the traffic signs around one Sunday....

rec.autos	 I agree that a fully-loaded SL2 would come close in price to a LOWER-END Ford Taurus. A FULLY-LOADED Taurus, on the other hand, would still be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy SL2. A fully loaded SL2 would run somewhere around $17,000, while a fully loaded Taurus LX would be somewhere around the $22,000-$23,000 range. A base Taurus (GL I believe) might start around $15,000. Of course there is the Taurus SHO which can push $30,000 if you really try, but this is a totally different car than your mainstream Taurus sedan. Your statement was not entirely faulty, just a little inaccurate.

rec.autos	 My GS came with XGT V4s and they are NOT all weather tires. I took out my right front bumper sliding on packed snow (not ice), before I learned this fact. I immediately bought XGT H4s which are definately all-weather. A Carrera 4 I walk by everyday has XGT V4s on it even. The Michelin dealer where I bought my new tires said the V4s were made out of a different rubber that gets really hard and slick when the weather gets near feezing. Said he'd only try to sell me those tires during the winter if we were in Texas and not Colorado. 
rec.autos	 Any truth to the rumor of an AWD 3-series for '94? I believe this info was published in either Popular Science or AutoWeek a couple of months ago. 
rec.autos	 While your 0-60 time is consistent with most car magazines and reports, I saw the PBS MotorWeek show clock a 5-speed SL2 at 7.9 seconds. I'm sure that most SL2 owners will be VERY lucky to get this speed, but 7.9 seconds is still astonishingly fast for a small 4-door. A new Civic EX runs about 8.2 seconds 0-60, if I'm not mistaken. Most cars in this class are lucky to be in the 9-second range. 
rec.autos	 in europe you can buy a 525iX, with computer controlled diffs rather than the horrid viscous coupled ones of the outgoing 325iX. 
rec.autos	 As I live in Sweden I remember the day perfectly well. We changed side 1967-09-03 (or 03-SEP-1967). I don't remeber the exactly time but it was in the night. (in the 'big' cities like Stockholm & Gothenburg all trafic was forbidden, exept busses and taxis, during the whole weekend.) The day was a Sunday and everything was prepared in before. 
rec.autos	 740 Turbo in UK was good for 124mph. Useful for blowing away VW Beetles, though I believe the Beetle corners better. 
rec.autos	 I would probobly feel a hell of a lot poorer... a gas tank is about 50$ in a junkyard. An engine... more! 
rec.autos	 I understand Caddy is working on one, double battery, super high perf engine, more gauges, a bit 'stretched', etc, lots of communication equipment, the works. Color selection is limited though. 
rec.autos	 As an additional data point, I have run Castrol 20W50 exclusively in the following cars: 75 Rabbit, 78 Scirocco, 76 Rabbit, 78 Bus, 70 Beetle, 76 Bus, 86 Jetta GLI. I've never had an oil-related problem. 
rec.autos	 I agree. Six hour long stretches behind the wheel really make me thirsty, especially for something with caffeine. I consider it a failing of my car that it has no cup holder nor anywhere to put a cup holder. 
rec.autos	 Oh, well... I have to admit that the most disgusting feature of Volvo's is their marketing. It looks like Volvo uses something like "Do you dare to risk your family in any car?" attitude, which is quite annoying in the long run. 
rec.autos	 We had those f*****g photo-radar things here in Sweden a while ago. There was a lot of fuzz about them, and a lot of sabotage too (a spray-can with touch-up paint can do a lot of good...). 
rec.autos	 Just found a great deal on a Clifford Delta car alarm, $450 installed. Comes with glass break sensor, motion detector, and shock detector. Does anyone have one of these alarms? Are they any good? From the looks of it, its about the best on the market for the price. It's also on sale, so that's another reason to get it. I think I'll be saving almost $200. Any opinions? 
rec.autos	 Yes, there is: consumer confusion. In the early 80's with the fuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage. Diesel fuel was the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage than comparable gasoline engines. So, GM decided to conver their 350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter). Big mistake. The engine was not redesigned, but converted. The engine could not handle the higher compression, etc. Lots of problems with these cars. This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer -- DON"T BUY A DIESEL. THEY ARE BAD. This was a gross generalization. 
rec.autos	 A "fuel injector cleaning" at the dealer is probably little more than them opening your gas tank, dumping in a bottle of fuel injector cleaner, and sending you on your merry way $59 poorer. Go to KMart and buy the cleaner yourself for $1.29. 
rec.autos	 I was out of date. VW is stealing execs directly from Opel, independent of Lopez. Shameful.

rec.autos	 This should not be the case if they are at all reputable. Fuel injector cleaning is done properly with a can of injector cleaner solvent which is hooked up to the fuel system under high pressure. The car is actually run on the solvent during the cleaning process. The equipment to properly do this is pricey, and generally not something the average home mechanic has. The solvent itself is not very expensive ($5-$8) and you could probably make up a hose to fit your system and do it yourself, but I didn't tell you that... :-) 
rec.autos	 Quoting Jeffrey J. Nucciarone's (nucci@microwave.gsfc.nasa.gov) article <C4G8Hv.Cs4@skates.gsfc.nasa.gov of 04-06-93, in pertinent part:

rec.autos	 Not exactly dumb, but who remebers the tachometer on the 69 or 70 Firebird bulging out of the _hood_ right in front of the driver. Neat place but I love to know what the elemnts did to its internals after a few years. Also, does the speedomete pointer on many US cars have to be 3 feet long?. 
rec.autos	 I just went through this mess in New Jersey (I'm still waiting for a refund as well), namely, that the original company made a mistake and left me in the lurch.

rec.autos	 a couple of things: blowing a hose doesn't speak of engine reliability, and while it is true that quad4's have a problem with head gasket leaks, that was a design flaw in the gasket and has been corrected. also i know pontiac is replacing head gaskets that leak for free for 6year/60k miles. other than that i have found my quad4 to be completely solid and the direct ignition system means no wires/rotor/rotor-cap to ever deal with. also hydrolic lifters mean no valve adjustments ever. i'm not badmouthing the integra engine, i just think you are going overboard on slamming the quad4. you are quite correct that the integra engine is quieter, although i would not say smoother, my quad4 loves to rev, especially at the high-end. do you have any evidence of blocks cracking on quad4s? i have not heard of this. 
rec.autos	 Personally, i wouldn't use the $1.29 product from KMart. I knew about this previously, but this past weekend on PBS's MotorWeek Pat Goss (their resident tech type) discussed these products, and recommends not using them (i.e, the non-isopropyl alcohlo based injector cleaners). 
rec.autos	 Labour prices for car service are very expensive in Toronto compared to other parts of Ontario. For example, there are places in Ottawa that still charge "only" $40/hour. I've seen a couple of places charging $60/hour. The cheapest I've heard in Toronto is $70/hour. 
rec.autos	 Several years ago GM was having trouble with the rings sticking on the 5.7 diesel. They traced a cause to the use of 10W-40 oil. They would not honor warranty work if 10W-40 was used (if my memory serves me). 5-30, 10-30 or 20 50 was OK'd though.

rec.autos	 i'm sorry, as i have never heard of any of this. Guess they don't think it's important enough for a classroom, and i was going on what i've seen in pics.(some movies--real nice scource there, huh?) I just always recall thinking that GOOD roads of asphalt didn't come around til the Interstate Hiway Act, or whatever they called it(60's?), and that wood and cobblestone roads were fairly rare up through the depression, except in overpopulated places like England and US cities. Obviously netwisdom says i am wrong.

rec.autos	 recently-manufactured locomotives have wheel-slip detection systems that use frequencies shared with police radar (i forget which band). these will set off your radar detector if you get close enough, though i believe the range is pretty short. 
rec.autos	 Well, if you want to stick the nose of your car up the ass of a 50 foot semi, I suppose it's your neck, however, I'm not going to let you kill me in the bargain. If you get frustrated by somebody delaying your inevitable death due to less that wise driving practices, then TOUGH!!! 
rec.autos	 You can avoid these problems entirely by installing an oil drain valve in place of the bolt. I have one on both of my cars. There have been no leaks in 210,000 miles (combined miles on both cars). 
rec.autos	 Sorry I can't help you with your question, but I do have a comment to make concerning aftermarket A/C units. I have a Frost-King or Frost-Temp (forget which) aftermarket unit on my Cavalier, and am quite unhappy with it. The fan is noisy, and doesn't put out much air. I will never have an aftermarket A/C installed in any of my vehicles again. I just can't trust the quality and performance after this experience. 
rec.autos	 I'd like to see you use this method on a couple of semi drivers. If they see you, they usually acknowledge by sticking their hand out the window with their middle finger extended. Because it is also obvious to them that there is no clear lane ahead. 
rec.autos	 A while back I asked for help in defending a traffic ticket I received. In short: The ticket was for not stopping at a stop sign. Given the conditions I could not stop in time and decided instead of sliding right through the intersection, I would complete my right-turn and avoid a possible accident. A police cruiser happened to be approaching the intersection from my left and gave me the ticket. The officer said "The only reason that you even slowed down in the first place was that you saw me approaching, otherwise you would have bombed right through" 
rec.autos	 I had exactly the same problem with a 1981 Horizon. Third gear would just disengage. Engine would rev up. Kind of disconcerting. 
rec.autos	 I have a 1982 Regal and I am interested in buying a fiberglass hood, trunk, and bumpers for it. Does anybody know of a company who makes fiberglass parts for Regals ?? 
rec.autos	 This makes sense(radar pointed down), because almost every train I pass head-on that triggers my radar detector does so more just after I have passed the front of the engine. I get a little of the reflections as I am approaching and the instant I get to the side of the first engine the detector receives a fairly strong signal for a short time. It happens with just about EVERY train I see. 
rec.autos	 I consulted with someone working on an electronic odometer. The design was to use a microprocessor based system to write a somewhat ofuscated pattern into an EEPROM. The idea was to make the circuit difficult to program arbitrary values into the EEPROM. The secondary purpose, acutally the primary purpose from the standpoint of practicality, was to distributed the writes so as to avoid exceeing the maximum number of writes fof the EEPROM being used. The microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from the Hall effect at a rate any higher than 110 MPH so as to make spoofing the reading by bench pulsing at least somewhat undesirable. This was for an automobile that was not expected to ever exceed 110 MPH in operation. The case, of course, might not be the same for your 1993 RX-7!

rec.autos	 I have a 86 chevy sprint with a/c and 4doors. It's odometer turned 90k and the sensor light started blinking. I went to the dealer and he said it was a maintenance light saying I need to change the Oxygen sensor. He said, It is to be changed every 30k, but since I bought the car when it had 77k, I don't know if the same thing happened at 30k and 60k. He quoted $198 for the part and $50 to install it. The part cost $30 outside, but the mechanic I went to could not fix it saying the sensor is placed too deep in the engine parts. He suggested I wait till it malfunctions before I do anything. If anyone out there owns a chevy sprint, I want to know how they got their Oxygen sensors changed. Also, did you face any problem with fixing it without the dealer's help. Also, what are the results of the oxygen sensor malfunction. Any help would be greatly apprecisted Thanks Nagesh 
rec.autos	 Well, before we start calling the Engineering folks in France a bunch of braindeads for this... My 1979 Mercury Capri had this lovely feature.

I figure that when I add three or four quarts when the oil light comes on every month or so that it's just as good or better than the old wives tale of changing the oil AND filter every 3000 miles. Works for me, I must say. 
rec.autos	 Most cars have drain petcocks in the radiators, and I've never seen nor heard of a vandal opening one. I imagine that there would be an even lower risk with an oil plug because you have to crawl furthur under the car to open it. 
rec.autos	 You can go to the DMV and ask for their listing. Although I don't know where you may actually buy a copy, you can use theirs for your perusal. In California, the listing of personalized license plates run 3 volumes, each about 1.5" thick. I hope this is what you're asking for. 
rec.autos	 I did the same thing to my drain plug for the same reasons. I was wondering how you filled your crankcase though as I welded my hood shut also out of fear that somebody might steal my air-filter. 
rec.autos	 Unfortunately, I've got another story to add to this. My girlfriend and I were driving through west L.A., and got pelted by a rock just as we were pulling away from a stoplight. The scary thing was that the rock was heavy enough to put a decent-sized dent in the door of my '72 Riviera which is pretty much solid "Detriot Iron." Couple of inches higher and it would have gone through the window. 
rec.autos	 I saw an interesting product in NY Auto Show, and would like to hear your comments. 
rec.autos	 W will NOT do work on internal engine components of the SHO engine. This W W Good thing, too. W W At about 25K miles my cam sensor went south. 2 different Ford W dealers tried 5 or 6 different "fixes", none of which worked. Finally W I took it down the street to the local mechanic. This guy reads the W code off the engine computer, says "Bad cam sensor", and fixes it in W an hour... 
rec.autos	 Just a quick comment. Backup lights mounted on the side would actually be *extremely* useful for people backing out of parking stalls... 
rec.autos	 This is a two-sided problem. Unfortunately our culture has been deteriorating over time. The "breeding" of these low-life's is getting worse; our justice system is at best extremely weak to handle these problems. That is why low-abiding citizens should have the power to protect themselves and their property using deadly force if necessary anywhere a threat is imminent. 
rec.autos	 You make it sound like this behavior is new. It isn't. A lot of pedestrian bridges have fencing that curls up over the sidewalk to make this kind of think a lot harder to do. 
rec.autos	 Their number is 1-800-541-4716 they are based in Chicago, IL in case you need to call dir assistance. 
rec.autos	 While I can't think of any Corvettes with side mounted backup lights, I know that Saab started using them about 15 years ago. My 1975 Saab 99 didn't have them, but a friend's 1978 Saab 99 certainly did. In addition to the confentional tail-light mounted backup lights, they had another set integrated into the front turn signal assembly. For those of you who don't remember, Saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic growth, about the size of a _National Geographic_ magazine, sticking out of the front fender, which incorporated amber "parking lights", amber side marker lights/reflectors, white "cornering lamps" (like American luxury cars) aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators on, and white "backup lights" aimed towards the back of the car when you have selected reverse gear. The glossy brochure showed how these front mounted backup lights were useful for illuminating hazards (pot holes, kid's toys, etc) that would be run over by the front of the car if you had the wheels turned while backing up. 
rec.autos	 Les Bartel's comments: Sorry I can't help you with your question, but I do have a comment to make concerning aftermarket A/C units. I have a Frost-King or Frost-Temp (forget which) aftermarket unit on my Cavalier, and am quite unhappy with it. The fan is noisy, and doesn't put out much air. I will never have an aftermarket A/C installed in any of my vehicles again. I just can't trust the quality and performance after this experience.

rec.autos	 I have been looking at buying a 1989 Jeep Laredo and was wondering if anyone had any bad or good experiences with this model. Is it all that much different than the other YJs? 
rec.autos	 Society, as we have known it, it coming apart at the seams! The basic reason is that human life has been devalued to the point were killing someone is "No Big Deal". Kid's see hundreds on murderous acts on TV, we can abort children on demand, and kill the sick and old at will. So why be surprised when some kids drop 20 lbs rocks and kill people. They don't care because the message they hear is "Life is Cheap"! 
rec.autos	 Well, I never wrote that I would act as you described. I stated that I would not block a would-be passer. I would not block a would-be passer "for their own good" or for any reason other than I was prevented from doing so due to the traffic circumstance. I fail to see how deterring a passer under these circumstance would IN ANY WAY decrease YOUR chances of being involved in an accident, fatal or otherwise. In fact, I could imagine how blocking a would-be passer would actually INCREASE your chances of being "offed" or involved in an accident, especially if this "passer" is riding your bumper. Intentionally blocking a person riding your bumper is certainly NOT a "wise driving practice", it only causes the jam to become more congested. 
rec.autos	 Is anyone reading this message involved with the new BMW plant? (does BMW corporate even have a net-connection?) 
rec.autos	 I know that this isn't the group for it, but since you brought it up, does anyone have any idea why they haven't "bombed" the Waco cult? 
rec.autos	 Wasn't the original intent of the reverse lights for the driver, so he could see where he was backing up??? Although reverse lights on the sides are useful for telling whether cars are backing up out perpendicular to the path of the car, I don't think warnings were their original intents, since they are colored white. 
rec.autos	 A little bit off of the subject but here goes yes he is one in the same (i.e. Chevrolet Motor Div) also his brother Gaston raced at Indy and was the winner in 1920. I have also seen the name Arthur Chevrolet in the early teens (1911 and on) I assume he is related 
rec.autos	 I bought an Intrepid about two months ago and am very happy with it. Lots of room inside and even with the smaller engine it has enough power for me. The only problem I found was a small selection on the dealer's lots. They are hot sellers around here. 
rec.autos	 Ah, yes, the big chunks down in the sump. The solution is simple. Sort of like the advice my Aunt always gave -- never scratch your ear with anything except your elbow. 
rec.autos	 I have just taken delivery on a new GM car (Firebird) with a clearcoat finish. I assume that it is probably urethane since the industry has moved in that direction in paints. 
rec.autos	 IS there a simple way tooput these sunroofs out of their misery - do leaks tend to be from old gaskets ? or from inadequate mechanical seals - or all of the above ?? 
rec.autos	 I don't know if some lemons are out there, but from personal experience My brother's has been trouble free. Not one single repair, only regular maintainance. The only work he had done on it was a result of his stupidity... he stopped suddenly in the middle of a left turn on a busy intersection, and was rear-ended. He has a 1989 Plymouth Sundance. I would recomend it, but I would also like to say that if you can wait about six months, ChryCo is coming out with a new car called the Neon, that is built in the same way as the LH's where. Good luck with your desiscion. 
rec.autos	 Is clear coat really worth it? Yes, on the showroom floor, the cars have this deep, lustrous shine that just can't be found on paint jobs that aren't clear coated. On the other hand, it seems that every clear coated car that I've seen on the road (in a parking lot, etc.) has fine scratches throughout the paint job. As does, alas, my 1992 Laser. 
rec.autos	 Do you have a "kill" file for your newsreader? I put the name "Spencer" in my kill file and that gives me about 10-15 less articles PER DAY that I have to sift through. 
rec.autos	 Yeah. I don't use the clutch all the time either. I've done it with Fords, BMW, Datsun, and Chevy and it works fine. I can't think of any reason that it would damage the tranny. Essentially you are just doing what the synchros do anyhow - match the engine speed with the tranny speed and slip it into gear. 
rec.autos	 I have a 1986 Acura Integra 5 speed with 95,000 miles on it. It is positively the worst car I have ever owned.

rec.autos	 I'm plannig to trade my Sentra SE-R in with a NX2000. My car has 11,500 miles on it and is a '92 model. The NX2000 the dealer is selling is a '91 model with 23,000miles on it. It has a T-Bar Roof, a/c, and an airbag, which my Sentra does not have. They are asking for $1500. Is that a fair deal? The only thing I noticed about the NX2000 is that the engine did not seem to have as much torque as my Sentra which has the same identical engine. I presume that the last lady owner did not really push the engine to it's limits occassionaly while I did that on mine, thuis the NX2000's engine is a little "tight." So, if I buy the NX2000 and "excercise" it well, should that slight power problem go away? Any advice on this will be much appreciated. Thanks. Please reply via e-mail if possible. 
rec.autos	 Yes. Nobody is watching them. If they get caught, there is no punishment at all. In the old days such behaviour would be rewarded with a whipping with a good-sized belt, and then taken into some hospital to see first hand what kind of damage such accidents cause. Of course this doesn't happen any more. That whipping would probably save the kid's life by teaching him some respect for others. A person with that little respect would inevitably wind up dead early anyway. 
rec.autos	 This last comment was obviously a bit cynical, but a true statement of the attitude of some drivers (there's your "autos" content), I would say. 
rec.autos	 Neil, what did they do to the 14-year-old who they caught? What did the man's insurance company do? This could be significant and in any case very interesting. 
rec.autos	 the transmission in my car contradicts both your assertions.. i get much stronger acceleration if i let the convertor lockup.. which i can induce by briefly lifting off, then quickly (but not too quickly to trigger a kickdown) applying throttle. above 3000 rpms, the convertor will never unlock; it would kickdown first.

rec.autos	 I recently posted an article asking what kind of rates single, male drivers under 25 yrs old were paying on performance cars. Here's a summary of the replies I received. 
rec.autos	 Hello, I am looking to slightly increase the performance of my 89 Honda Civic Si. I was wondering if anyone could suggest upgrades that were not too drastic. I thought that one of the easiest upgrades would be a new header. Does anyone know what kind of increase that the header would give me? I think I would check with Jackson Racing for the part. Are there any other comparines would make Honda parts. 
rec.autos	 Alright GM!!!! Finally my wishes have come true, Moby Dick with a Corvette engine. DOn't you think they should maybe spend the money doing something about the lousy build/quality/design of their bigger selling cars? This is another example of why GM is in so much trouble. If you're going to stick the LT-1 or ZR-1 engine in a car, at least make it a nice looking one. Sheesh

rec.autos	 Chances are that this has been discussed to death already, and if so could someone who has kept the discussion mail me or direct me to an archive site.

rec.autos	 Ford tried that also, back in 1983. My 1983 Ranger Pickup had the horn at the end of the turn-signal stalk, instead of in the center of the wheel where God intended it to be. :-) I drove two different cars then (the other an 1984 Camry), and never did get used to pushing the turn-signal stalk to blow the horn. The only time I got it right was when I was getting the annual state-required safety inspection! Not one of Ford's better ideas. 
rec.autos	 I grew up in New York City so I rode in many Checker cabs. The jump seats were fun as a kid. Although the cars were roomy -- a good trait for a taxi -- they had a design flaw that I don't understand they never fixed: the rear passengers tended to fall out of their seats when the driver braked. I wouldn't want to take a long ride in the back seat of one of these vehicles. Why did you like yours? I never drove one, so I have to ask. 
rec.autos	 Take a look at mini-vans. I sat in a Dodge Caravan, which had a high seat and plenty of headroom. 
rec.autos	 I rented an Oldsmobile Achieva (is that a yuppie name or what?) and a Nissan Stanza. They both had automatics. I'm a manual transmission bigot but I have to admit that the transmissions on these cars were better shifters than I am. And yes, they responded very quickly to kickdown requests. The Nissan had a tachometer so I was able to figure out which gear I was in. (The Olds may have also, but I don't remember.) I believe it shifted all the way down to second at about 50 mph when my foot told it, "No I really want to accelerate quickly." 
rec.autos	 I was lloking at the Geo Prizm Lsi today (very nice). Anyway, I had a questions that the salesperson couldn't answer. How does the theft deterrent on the Prizm's audio systems work? Can't find the answer in any of Geo's lterature. Thanks in advance.

rec.autos	 From article <1993Apr15.024246.8076@Virginia.EDU, by ejv2j@Virginia.EDU ("Erik Velapoldi"): This happened about a year ago on the Washington DC Beltway. Snot nosed drunken kids decided it would be really cool to throw huge rocks down on cars from an overpass. Four or five cars were hit. There were several serious injuries, and sadly a small girl sitting in the front seat of one of them was struck in the head by one of the larger rocks. I don't recall if she made it, but I think she was comatose for a month or so and doctors weren't holding out hope that she'd live. 
rec.autos	 About a year ago, some kids tossed a rock off an overpass on I-94 near Eau Claire, Wisconsin and it killed the driver below. (I believe he was a schoolteacher from Minnesota.) 
rec.autos	 A similar thing happend to me a year ago. I bought a used Ford Bronco (which has since been stolen... :( ) and few weeks after I paid and took delivery, they sent a letter telling me they goofed and miscalculated the license renewal by $300 and that I need to send in a check to "avoid further delay" in the processing of my registration. The thing is, I had already received the pink slip from the DMV, so I ignored it. I received another letter and then the phone calls started coming. First from the finance guy and then from the general manager, both hounding me for the extra money. They left me alone once I told them I already had the paperwork and pointed out the clause in the contract that stated that the final price was just that: FINAL. Afterall, they wouldn't budge if I had told them I wanted another $300 off after the deal had been signed, right? I told them not to call again and that I would not do business with them in the future. They didn't seem to have a problem with that. This, after all, was a used Ford at a Toyota dealership.

rec.autos	 My whole point was not to say that the cars *couldn't* go that fast, but that they *shouldn't* go that fast. A family sedan designed to be operable at 85mph doesn't suddenly become operable at 130mph because you added some plastic aero effects, slightly wider tires, and a much larger engine. That's what the SHO is -- a slightly modified family sedan with a powerful engine. They didn't even bother improving the *brakes.*

He called me back with exactly what I wanted from a dealer 125mi away, I took delivery the next day. 
rec.autos	 Lack of build quality was the thing I notced on the first 2 LH's I saw months back.

I drove one of the low end cars, and thought it was more than adequate. I'd prefer an LH to a Taurus from my brief experience. 
rec.autos	 The quality of autobahns is something of a myth. The road surface isn't much different to a typical TX freeway.

rec.autos	 Perhaps it is because witnesses who have left the compound have all testified that the BATF shot first, they they did not identify themselves before tossing in concussion grenades (not that anyone inside could have _heard_ such identification after being near a concussion grenade) and the announcement from the BATF that they have sealed the warrant under which they were operating - which was a _search_ warrant, by the way, _not_ an arrest warrant. In short, perhaps because the BATF is wildly out of control and perhaps calmer heads have realized that bombing a compound full of woman and children will not improve their position. There is a real chance that Koresh will be able to prove self-defense in court. That will leave - what? - four officers dead and no one to blame but the BATF.

Of course shooting someone because they throw a rock at your car is out of the question, but what if they disabled your car with their rock and then wanted to come kill/rape/rob/beat/ or otherwise harm you, your wife, kids? I think you would like the power to defend yourself in this situation, wouldn't you? Or is it that you value the lives of such rock throwers more than your own or those of your family? Don't think it couldn't happen to you. From the sounds of it here it has happened to a few people.

rec.autos	 Why crawl under the car at all? I have a machine I got for my boat that pulls the oil out under suction through the dip stick tube. It does an excellent job and by moving the suction tube around, you can get more old oil out than by using the drain plug. I think I paid $25 at E&B Marine. The oil goes into a steel 3 gal can - wait until it cools and decant into your favorite device. I use soft drink bottles. Easy to take them down to the local oil recycle center. 
rec.autos	 But, those chips are probably inside a custom chip, (to make it smaller and use less power) and the preset/data pins are not going to be available. It would probably not be TTL but might be CMOS (wider operating voltage range), not that the tecnology would make much difference. Plus the custom chip would probably be potted (encapsulated with epoxy). Good luck. 
rec.autos	 The Mustang is a much worse case of design irresponsibility than the SHO. plant stuck in a mid-size sedan, with almost no other modifications. I have real-life experience with the Mustang -- it handles like a brick (except when you're invoking oversteer, of course, something I 
rec.autos	 I dont know about the car comparison but as far as the price goes rest assured that the street prices for the MX-3 and Escort and (maybe) even the Honda will be lesser than that of the Saturn you're talking about. All price comparisons I've seen are based on MSRP and of course the saturn dealer will sell the car for sticker price whereas the others will do it way below sticker. 
rec.autos	 As long as we're on the subject... Several years ago myself and two others were riding in the front of a Toyota pickup heading south on Interstate 5 north of Seattle, WA. Someone threw a rock of an overpass and hit our windshield. Not by accident I'm sure, it was impossible to get up to the overpass quickly to see who did it. We figured it was kids, reported it and left. A couple of years ago it happend again and killed a guy at my company. He was in his mid-fourties and left behind a wife and children. Turned out there was a reformatory for juviniles a few blocks away. They caught the 14 year old that did it. They put a cover over the overpass, what else could they do? I don't think I'll over forget this story. Neil Williams, Boeing Computer Services, Bellevue WA. 
rec.autos	 this week's autoweek talks about how wagons are getting back in vogue. i wouldn't mind an audi s4 wagon (great stealth value) but you'll never catch me dead in a minivan! 
rec.autos	 Here in Houston a couple years ago a young pregnant woman was killed in a similar manner. 
rec.autos	 That's nothing. When a friend of mine went shopping for a small sedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male so the salespeople wouldn't give her the "bimbo" treatment. Her first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a Nissan Sentra. We went to a Mazda dealership and described what "we" wanted. We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroid kept playing the "let me run this price by the sales manager". After playing the "good salesman, bad salesman" game, we finally told him that if he didn't have the authority to negotiate a price, perhaps we should be speaking directly to someone who did. He brought in the sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick in the book. (Read Remar Sutton's "Don't Get Taken Every Time" for a list.) Finally, after playing a few more rounds of "you'll have to work with us on this price", also known as "each time you come up a thousand dollars we'll come down ten", the salesmanager gave a signal to his two sales cronies, stood up, and said "well, we can't come down any more so I guess we can't help you" and they trouped out of the room, leaving us sitting in the salesman's office all by ourselves. Hmm. I'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they can leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and I mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering why they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the door. For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on the desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman, and began discussing what kind of price they would consider. A few sentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line (!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call another dealership from "his" phone! I said that since he'd announced that our business was over, he shouldn't care, and every time I tried to talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our voices with his own. (How did he know that I was using the phone, anyway?) Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom. Sales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he begins to berate us again. We say that we won't bother him anymore, we're going next door to the Nissan dealership. 
rec.autos	 I was following an example of the LH the other day, and noticed the fit between the tunk lid and the rear bumper. The gap was quite small on the left side, but much larger on the right. Blech!!! 
rec.autos	 Sure, but the surface condition of most good autobahns is far better than most of the roads here. A dip in the asphalt that you test your shocks on at 60 will kill you at 130. Don't get me wrong, I love to drive quickly and they say my Probe will do 130, but that's 30 more than I've ever tried in it cause there isn't a decent enough piece of road hereabouts.

rec.autos	 Oh come on, Silly, all you have to do is cut a hole in your hood and put a tube there so you can get to the oil fill hole. What do you think all those big air intake things are for on those hot-rod cars? They're just for looks only...little does anyone know, they provide access to the oil-fill hole. 
rec.autos	 The Continental may have been the first "modern era" auto to mount the spare on the rear of the car but it was hardly the first car to sport one. Various mounting techniques for rear mounting the spare were quite common in early automobiles, both US and Foreign. 
rec.autos	 This seems to be a popular scam with dealers. Last month my brother bought a new Audi 90 series quatro from a local dealer. They came back with the final price, tax and all, and he added it up for himself. There happened to be an extra $300 tagged on under the tax part. He pointed out their error and asked them to re-think their addition. They came back with the right price the next time. 
rec.autos	 Hm... I find this hard to believe. V16T weights about the same as the Red Head, but it has hell lot more horse power. Perhaps it's due to pre-production glitches? Well, to me, it still got the most imposing styling among all the sports cars I have seen. 
rec.autos	 Hi, maybe someone can help me here... I am looking to buy this 1990 Nissan Maxima GXE for CDN$14000 right now. The car has 96000 km (or about 60000 miles) on it. A typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km (or about 43K mi). The seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced to meet the legal standards. (He said he will replace the components before selling the car to me.) 
rec.autos	 I'd hate to rehash an old thread, but... Would someone kindly quote a prices that a dealer quotes for a Civic EX, and Escort GT. Also, I'm a assuming that the MX-3 was the V-6, so go ahead and look that up, too. If someone has one of those yearly buyers' guides that give a low quote price, please quote them, too. Then find the the SC1 base price.

rec.autos	 Because Greyhound has apparently gotten around to installing their RADAR collision-prevention system. They use RADAR to monitor how close other vehicles are and how fast their relative speeds are, and signals a warning to the driver if they're coming up on something too fast or are getting too close. 
rec.autos	 I have been for a fairly hard run in an MX5, what they lack in power they surely make up for in handling. Great for back streets with heaps of corners. They are a fairly light car with a low center of gravity and a quite free revving DOHC engine, a fun car. Have you driven a TURBO converted MX5? Now they are starting to perform! I've often thought a Mazda rotary would go well in the XM5 too....anyone done it? 
rec.autos	 If I hear someone screwing with my car (ie, setting off the alarm) and taunting me to come out, you can be damn sure that my Colt Delta Elite will also be coming with me. It's not the screwing with the car that'd get them shot, it's the potential physical danger. If they're taunting like that, it's very possible that they also intend to rob me and/or do other physically harmful things. 
rec.autos	 I don't know where you live, but I couldn't get out of my driveway at night without reverse lights. As someone said, out in the country you notice neat little things like stars and the difference between day and night. At night around my house (which is amongst a forest of rather tall oaks) it is DARK, except for nights with full moons. Reverse lights illuminate my path very well when backing up; I greatly prefer cars with them to cars without operational reverse lights. 
rec.autos	 It was the issue with the Diablo VT AWD on the cover. Naturally, I don't remember the date of the issue offhand, but I can check it if anyone is interested. 
rec.autos	 From article <1qkkl5INNbvo@hp-col.col.hp.com, by theckel@col.hp.com (Tim Heckel): For those that are interested I got my fully optioned (Air, ABS, sunroof) '92 SE-R in September 1991 for $13,555 in Sacramento, CA. It was one of the 1st '92s sold, few of the dealers had any, no local dealer had an ABS equipped SE-R. I went straight to the fleet manager at the dealership I liked, told him what I wanted, made him aware that I knew what his price should be. He called me back with exactly what I wanted from a dealer 125mi away, I took delivery the next day. 
rec.autos	 Perhaps instead of this silly argument about what backup lights are for, couldn't we agree that they serve the dual purpose of letting people behind your car know that you have it in reverse and that they can also light up the area behind your car while you're backing up so you can see? 
rec.autos	 hmmmm.. not sure, since no such beast exists.. i can tell you another though.. you won't catch me dead in a GMC Syclone or Typhoon either, 1000 bhp or not.. not even the fact that Clint Eastwood has one. just my taste, no rational reasons for it. 
rec.autos	 no, but somebody's dropped a ford 302 V-8 into the miata, somewhat reminiscent of the shelby cobra. the car's obviously not as nimble as before, but it's supposed to have a near 50/50 weight distribution and handle very well. i'd sure love to drive one. 
rec.autos	 I'm no mustang head, but don't the early ones have a simple strut suspension (that is, with no upper A-arm)? Just a strut going down to a lower control arm (single bushing: not an A-arm), with a tension/compression rod locating it in the forward/backward direction?

rec.autos	 Some other owners on the ford-probe@world.std.com mailing list have commented about this problem, but I haven't seen it happen on my 3 month old '93 Probe GT. I think this may be something that Ford has corrected since the initial batch of cars. Also, someone said that Ford has issued a service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem, so you may be able to get your dealer to fix it. 
rec.autos	 My 1988 Toyota 4Runner has a rolldown rear window with a keylock switch. It sticky on me. Yesterday it was tough to get the key to work and it also happened to stick on in the up direction so the stalled motor was powered all night killing the battery. 
rec.autos	 GM, at least, is heading in that direction. One of the post-sale questions they asked me was if I'd like the choice of a cigarette liter or an accessory plug, and another whether I'd like the choice of an ashtray or a cup holder.

It has a 2 liter carburated engine in it, and no blipping of the throttle would cause the idle to drop back to normal (I don't think the linkage is stuck). What can I do to fix this problem? This has been a problem from time to time, but has straightened itself out - until now. I don't have a tach, but by gauging by the sound of the engine, it is idling about twice as fast as it should be. This is down from what it was idling at when I pulled up at a stop light.

rec.autos	 Water gradually builds up in the trunk of my friend's 89 Ford Probe. Every once in a while we would have to remove the spare and scoop out the water under the plywood/carpet cover on the trunk. I would guess this usually happens after a good thunder storm. A few Qs: 
rec.autos	 I would be concerned about how the car was driven and how well it was maintained. I own a turbocharged one, and I would never buy a turbocharged vehicle unless I knew the owner and his/her driving/maintenance habits. 
rec.autos	 I was recently thumbing through the 1993 Lemon-Aid New Car Guide. What I found was a car would be given a 'Recommended' under the picture while a few sentences later noting how a driver and passenger were virtually guaranteed to be killed in a front end collision. The most highly recommended small car (The Civic) has the worst crash rating of all of the small cars listed. There were many such cases of 'great' vehicles where you wouldn't survive an accident. Is it only me, or is safety not one of the most important factors when buying a car? 
rec.autos	 Back to the F1 stuff for a second, note that the `auto' tranny in F1 _STILL_ shifts at the driver's command, not some preselected schedule. The driver still controls the shifting, not the transmission. 
rec.autos	 My BBB Autoline arbitration experience is over. The outcome was decidedly mixed. I won the battle but lost the war. The arbitrator found that the car was defective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below market value :(. At the time of the hearing, average retail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but the decision was for $17,665. I wrote a letter to the Council of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the fact that if you have an automobile that does not depreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive to deal with you. There is no way that the manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded a repurchase. The attitude of Chevrolet's representative at the hearing tends to support this point of view; he was totally unprepared and did not seem to take the proceeding very seriously. 
rec.autos	 Yes, Fred, my heart and prayers go out to the mother and others who have been victims of these and other senseless crimes. 
rec.autos	 I own a del Sol and I must vouch for the interior. I really looks snazzy when the top is off. I looks a lot better in person than on the television. (I saw that Motorweek as well. Needless to say I was smiling a bit by the time it was over ...) :*) 
rec.autos	 I think VW got caught out on the airbag thing. It's only been in the last year or two that airbags have become a significant selling feature. VW assumed that automatic belts would satisfy govt. requirements for passive restraint, but didn't guess that the 'merican consumer would actually make buy decisions based on the presence of an airbag. 
rec.autos	 I sold my '86 Sprint last April with 95k on it. I'd driven it since the previous July, putting 20k miles on it. The sensor light used to light up regularly, starting about 5k miles after I bought it. My brother and I rebuilt the engine but used all of the original equipment, so I suppose the sensor could have used replacement. Performance (hah, if you could call it that) did not change. Perhaps emissions increased, but how much emissions could a CA-registered 3 cylinder engine produce? That was a neat car, I held the engine block easily in one hand! Has anyone ever driven the 'Turbo' variant? Just curious... 
rec.autos	 The only thing about the 300ZX turbo and new Supra is they're about $10K or more over his budget... 
rec.autos	 I just read articals on this in Road and Track and Car and Driver (Is that one mag or two? =B^), and I was wondering if people out there have any opinions that differed from what these mags have to say... 
rec.autos	 It depends on your priorities. A lot of people put higher priorities on gas mileage and cost than on safety, buying "unsafe" econoboxes instead of Volvos. I personally take a middle ground -- the only thing I really look for is a three-point seatbelt and 5+mph bumpers. I figure that 30mph collisions into brick walls aren't common enough for me to spend that much extra money for protection, but there are lots of low-speed collisions that do worry me. 
rec.autos	 That reminds me of one of Texas's ads...you hear a guy speaking in French (like it's a letter home), then the French moves to the background, and a French-accented voice come to the foreground, talking about how he went walking on the beach, and it felt so much like home that he decided to take his shoes off...and the rest of his clothes. It ended with "please send bail." :-) 
rec.autos	 Hmmm....I was listening to the local radio expert (who is, amazingly enough, an Honest-to-God Expert(tm); it's amazing what he knows...), and he said that, based on his conversations with the inventor of Slick50 (who is no longer with the comapny, due to some kind of conflict), he avoids it like the plague. He does recommend other teflon-based/type oil additives, though. 
rec.autos	 I really must object to that last statement. Having a lot of experience with a '92 Grand Am coupe, I can firmly state that they do have a lot of outstanding qualities. Very reliable throughout. Great layout of controls and components. Very roomy considering the exterior size of the car. They look sharp inside and out. The V6 that I drive has exceptional power and drivability compared to other similar cars that I have driven. 
rec.autos	 I was wondering if anyone out there could enlighten me on this car I saw the other day. It was a 2-door sports car, looked to be from the late 60s/ early 70s. It was called a Bricklin. The doors were really small. In addition, the front bumper was separate from the rest of the body. This is all I know. If anyone can tellme a model name, engine specs, years of production, where this car is made, history, or whatever info you have on this funky looking car, please e-mail. 
rec.autos	 Can we please stick to AUTOMOTIVE topics . Thank you. Lines: 1 
rec.autos	 Depending on how you plan to use your SUV, I might recommend also browsing Trailer Boats and one or more of those Pickup, Shotgun, and 4WD magazines. The car rags mostly seem to consider recently graded pea gravel to be offroading and ten sacks of redwood chips to be a bedload. Considering that most of these SUVs seem to be used mostly as robust station wagons, that's probably not a bad approach, but if your applications are more demanding, pick your information sources accordingly. 
rec.autos	 Sounds a lot more like an Opel GT to me. I'd guess that this is on the same chassis as the Kadett, rather than the bigger Manta - but I could easily be wrong. I think the later Kadett's were sold here as Buick Opels. 
rec.autos	 Graham E. Thomas, grahamt@phantom.gatech.edu writes: Alright, beat this automobile sighting. 
rec.autos	 I think the Manta is the European name for the "GT." I'm pretty sure that the only Kadett's sold here were/are the Pontiac LeMans. I think the GT is just an early '70s to mid '70s Manta. 
rec.autos	 Sounds more like an Opel GT. Neat cars, fun to drive. Sold through Buick from 196? through 1973 (if I remember correctly). I believe it was in '72 that there were some engine mods made such that parts were not interchangeable with the older models. Parts are thus much harder to come by for the later models. Parts in general are not too difficult to find. At one time JC Whitney carried some stuff including a brand new (not remfg) long block. Either a GT or a Kharman Ghia (hmm that spelling looks hosed) will be my next project.

rec.autos	 Of course it releases radiation! Thats why your car goes faster when you punch the holes in it. All that radiation gets on your engine and gives it "pep" (scientific term). You get more horsepower & torque too! If you don't know what HP & torque are, you can read mile long threads on the subject, but they are all wrong. Horsepower is how much power a horse can make pulling a Subaru, and torque is a name invented by Craftsman for a wrench. 
rec.autos	 I remember this happening on the I-75 through Michigan and Ohio several years back. A group of guys in an old beater would rear end a car, usually out of state or Canadians. You stop and they smack you with a BB bat. At least they didn't kill you for the sake of a car. I think the cops put out decoys and this calmed down for a while.

rec.autos	 Geez wharfie, do you have to be so difficult? Mine was built in December '88, which qualifies as pretty dang early, and it most certainly grinds away. 
rec.autos	 The answer to your question is...sort of. Volkswagen had a much less robust version of this army vehicle out in the early '70's (or thereabouts). It was called the Volskwagen Thing, and was, of course, a convertible. I havent seen many around then or now. Good luck... -Mik 
rec.autos	 I'd go for a '39 Lincoln Continental if I could find one. Sad part is that Edsel Ford designed it, and look at the abortion they named after him. Ain't no justice. 
rec.autos	 Right. In the thirties both Buick and Packard had two spares mounted in wells in the front fenders. Of course that was back when the front fenders were long enough to provide room. There were a couple of other marques that did this as well, but memory fades. 
rec.autos	 Shades of the Edsel! They had pushbuttons in the steering wheel hub that controlled the auto tranny. It was very disconcerting to shift into reverse when turning a corner and the wires shorted. 
rec.autos	 I think this is getting a little overheated. Highway robbers have been a part of life since the Middle Ages at least. It's human nature to look at history through rose colored glasses, but random acts of violence have been a ceaseless part of our heritage. Overall, life is better now than it ever was then. It's just that random individual acts of violence have never been historically significant, and record keeping in the past was never good enough to retain them all. 
rec.autos	 I have owned my Sprint from the beginning and that sensor light comes on every 30K to let you know it's time for a check up. When that light goes on, I just take it to the delaer tell them "It's that time" and they work on it for 4 hou and you pay $5 for parts and $100 for labor. (Ahh...what they get for labor) I currently have about 95K on my Sprint and of all the times I took it in for service, I never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the Oxygen sensor. What the heck is an Oxygen sensor? As far an I know of, I have never had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten. Now, I don't have a/c (Mother Nature does that for me :-) ) and that might have something to do with it, but I still never heard of an Oxygen sensor. The only MAJOR service job I have had on my car (besides getting the tires replaced if you want to call that a service job) was getting the Rotor, Distributor and Gasket replaced. And that was all done within the past 2 months. 
rec.autos	 MK48T02 from thomsom. It has a timekeeper (clock) and 512 bytes of NVRAM which has a lithium battery backup. The battery has a life of ~10 years of poweroff operation. Installed in a car it could be left powered on continuously and not draw much current. The battery would only be used when your auto battery was dead or had been removed. 
rec.autos	 i agree, *never* have the dealer add anything to your car. if you want a/c make sure it is factory installed(honda's maybe excluded, many can't be bought with a/c installed at the factory, but i think, maybe, they actually use all the needed parts for a true factory install when they put one in...as in bigger radiator etc...or are designed properly for this in the 1st place), anyway, my point is the dealer installed a/c won't be anywhere near as good as factory *and* the service bums will mess up your car when installing it... scratches, screwdriver holes in seats...parts not reinstalled correctly or with all the screws etc. i know a guy who has been service manager at a gm dealer for 18 years...he said never have a dealer add anything to your car... except, maybe, floormats... 
rec.autos	 Thanks to everyone who responded to my Honda Accord break question. It does seem that the master cylinder is bad. I will have my mechanic double check and be sure it isn't something simpler and cheaper first, but from your responses it sounds like it is very likely to be the master cylinder. 
rec.autos	 I was wondering if anyone out in net-land have any opinions on MGs in general. I know they are not the most reliable cars around but summer is approaching and they are convertibles `8^). I'm interested in a 75 MG but any opinions on MGs would be appreciated. Thanks. 
rec.autos	 Having spoken to technical staff from Ford many times, I can assure you that internally at Ford this car is always called the Taurus "Show" or just "the Show". As in long "o" sound. I still refer to it as the "S-H-O", however, because it sounds better to me. I assume many purist fans and owners prefer using the Ford lingo. 
rec.autos	 The VW "Thing" Kubelwagen lookalike is still manufactured in Mexico and possibly South America. Good luck importing one-- They probably don't meet US safety and pollution requirements. There are mechanics and junkyards which specialize in VW; they might be helpful for finding a "Thing" unless the WWII re-enacters have grabbed them all. 
rec.autos	 Society (MACS), that is, the people who stand to rake in that $300 to $1000 per retrofit per automobile, have mounted an organized campaign to squash those R12 substitutes out of existence if not ban them altogether (on very shaky technical grounds, at best, on outright lies at worst). 
rec.autos	 Are there any Honda groups out there? Especially ones that deal with Preludes? 
rec.autos	 Had an '83 Alliance for a long time. It was a comfortable but sluggish car. I got very used to the horn on the stalk, after a couple months worth of getting used to it. After I bought my next car, a Chevy, it took me for-EVER to get used to the horn on the steering wheel again! 
rec.autos	 not a flame, just a point: I'd be scared at 130 here, not because i feel _I_ or my car couldn't handle it, but because of exactly what you said: drivers who are STUPID. Like the ones who are doing 130 also, and so they pull in right behind you at maybe 1-2 car lengths....oh yeah, real smart... This scares me in cities at 50. When i can't see enough of the car to make it recognizable, they are following TOO CLOSE. And when i see them doing this AND reading a newspaper.....*sigh*...this is why America has 55-65 speed limits: our drivers are TOO DUMB to realise that reading the paper should be done at breakfast, or work, not in their car. 
rec.autos	 This kind of behavior is what I was shocked by in my 'experience'. For crying out loud, how do these turkeys think they can talk to customers this way and still stay in business? Again, I don't expect sales people to bow, scrape, and grovel in my presence but I sure don't expect to be abused either. I was very surprised by the way the sales people talked to me and in other 'negotiating' sessions I overheard in neighboring sales cubicles. Evidently, their success rate is high enough that they continue to do business this way. There must be a lot of people out there who are easy to intimidate. 
rec.autos	 Just an comment: I don't like it when people decide what's good for me... If you think you're going to decide anything for me, you'd better be carrying a badge and a gun. Who made you capable of determining if there is "no way in hell that anybody is going anywhere"? Why do you find it necessary to add to the problem instead of just minding your own business? If someone is minding their own business, I will give them all the room they want, and I'll try to make things easy for them, even letting them in in front of me if they ask politely (with a directional). On the other hand, if someone like you decides they want to block me and be a general asshole, you can bet your ass that I'll make life as miserable as possible for you, as long as it doesn't affect anyone else who's minding their own business. They have a phrase to describe someone like you: Self Appointed Traffic Police. Just mind your own business and stay in the right lane where you belong. 
rec.autos	 Yeah I suppose you could do that. But then you don't get the broken knuckles, the rust in your eyes, the oil bath, and the burns from the exhaust. 
rec.autos	 How about your two big toes? And while you're at it, why bother with removing the drain plug when you could remove the dipstick instead and suck it out from there with your mouth and then spit it out? 
rec.autos	 Bzzt. The manta was a two-door sedan in the US. It had a 1900 engine. Was sometimes referred to as an Opel 1900. Manta's are also ve hot and fun cars too. 
rec.autos	 I am in the process of looking for a half decent aftermarket sport exhaust for my 1981 BMW 320i. So far, I have found a Pacesetter exhaust for $219 and an Ansa exhaust for $190 (Canadian funds). I was wondering if anyone could tell me anyhting about either of these exhausts or any other possible exhausts that I may be interested in. My main priorities are a decent horse power increase (5-30%) and a nice low note to go along with that added power. I was also thinking of looking into both Remus and Leistritz exhausts.Has anyone got anything to say about these? I am mainly looking for the muffler only but if anyone can find a good deal on a whole kit I would be willing to go after that. I also would like to know how much these would cost me in the States.Please mail me back if you have any information. 
rec.autos	 I just had my 41 Chrysler painted. I was told to refrain from waxing it and to leave it out in the sun!! Supposedly this let's the volatiles escape from the paint over a month or so (I can smell it 15 feet away on a hot day) and lets any slight irregularites in the surface flow out, as the paint remains a little soft for a while. 
rec.autos	 My boss is interested in a new 300 series Mercedes Benz wagon. Does anyone have any testimonial evidence and/or strong opinions on this car (or line)? 
rec.autos	 There was an article in Business week not more the 4 weeks ago on this very subject. IN fact the Volvo 850 was one of the cars they laid out an example for. 
rec.autos	 Do you, by any chance own an SHO or have access to one, such that you would have any idea what it is designed for or how it handles? 
rec.autos	 assuming yours is a non turbo MR2, the gruffness is characteristic of a large inline 4 that doesn't have balance shafts. i guess toyota didn't care about "little" details like that when they can brag about the mid engine configuration and the flashy styling. 
rec.autos	 Execute the juvi on the grounds of the reformatory, required attendendence by the rest of the inmates, as soon as possible after the incident and a quick sure trial. I am quite serious. Cause and effect. Nothing else will ever make a dent. 
rec.autos	 That is absolutely correct. They have a streak of meanness that runs much deeper and stronger than anything I ever experienced even during the height of the 60's racial struggles. I am absolutely convinced that there are kids out there today that have no concept of right and wrong, but have the human intelligence which is turning them into the greatest predators that have ever walked the earth. They will prevail unless the rest of humanity decides that it is in their best interest to stand up against these feral humans, and for individuals to start taking some responsibility for their own protection. In a state in which the individuals turn to the authorities and police for protection, the police and government is soon composed of the very feral humans that they originally sought protection from. 
rec.autos	 Absolutely. A scratch on my car bothers me more than the death of any number of scum. All of you feel the same way---you just won't admit it. When are people going to realise that the mere fact that a piece of flesh moves and has the approximate shape of a human being does not in itself mean that it has "rights"? 
rec.autos	 I heard the diesels are considered cleaner-burning than gas engines because the emit less of: Carbon Monoxide, Hydrocarbons, and Oxides of Nitrogen. (CO, HC, NOX). 
rec.autos	 Yes, however, with the top off and the rear window down this car is more like a convertible than a coupe. Think of it as a convertible with an integrated roll-bar like addition. 
rec.autos	 addition, the front bumper was separate from the rest of the body. This is all I know. If anyone can tellme a model name, engine specs, years of production, where this car is made, history, or whatever info you have on this funky looking car, please e-mail. 
rec.autos	 Hi Netters I want to know if 13500 (w/o tax) is a good deal for 1993 Mazda 626 DX How is the performance review so far on Mazda 626. Is it a good buy? Please reply to me as I don't read this group often. 
rec.autos	 Well the European Manta and US GT have entirely different bodies. There is little or no chance that they are the same. The Manta went through several generations as the coupe version of the Ascona and was OK in its time. 
rec.autos	 I guess it either had the top down, or the hail ripped through the top, as you could not do $10k worth of hail damage to a Miata body. 
rec.autos	 Here is a story. I bought a car about two weeks ago. I finally can get hold of the previous owner of the car and got all maintanence history of the car. In between '91 and '92, the instrument pannel of the car has been replaced and the odometer also has been reset to zero. Therefore, the true meter reading is the reading before replacement plus current mileage. That shows 35000 mile difference comparing to the mileage on the odometer disclosure from. The dealer never told me anything about that important story. 
rec.autos	 I'm about to buy a new car and finance some of it. Since I paid cash for the last car I bought I did not have to worry about whether or not I had a good amount of insurance on it because of a bank loan. I just put the amount that I wanted (not what a bank would have wanted). Friends are telling me that banks require some kind of insurance on the car to protect it since it is collateral on loans. Is this true? Can that insurance be gotten as part of my other insurance? I assume I don't have to pay a dealer for extra insurance over my regular car insurance. Am I correct? I hear about accident/health type insurance at the dealers and I am pretty sure these are just money makers for them. I just want to verify that I don't _have_ to buy these at all. Or any other types of extras. 
rec.autos	 THis is from the same people who make the claim that our minivan is outsellin theirs.... implying that the Nissan Quest/ Murcury Villager are out-selling the Chrysler mini-vans.... not only is this not true at all, but it was a stupid claim to make... the commercial was part of the introduction campaign for the vans. Kind of a bold statement to make when you haven't even sold one yet, eh? 
rec.autos	 Then you shouldn't've done it. Try answering the damn question. I am well aware of the fact that there was no mention of the SC in there. 
rec.autos	 Another user recently requested info about the Shadow/Sundance cars, but I haven't seen any public responses. 
rec.autos	 This suggestion isn't as far-fetched as it sounds. Years ago in another time and place, I used to do oil changes in boats powered by automotive engines. In many cases, there was no way to get any sort of a tray under the oil pan because it was boxed in by the bottom of the hull and various floation chambers on each side. And if you *did* get something there, you'd spill all the oil out of it for sure trying to get it back out again. 
rec.autos	 This isn't anything new. Back in 1985 I was driving under a high overpass at night on I-805 in San Diego when I caught a glimpse of someone on the overpass. As I passed under a rock slammed against the metal between the winshield and right front window. My girlfriend was in the seat next to it. I called the police from the next exit, but I doubt if they were found. 
rec.autos	 Sorry, but *neither* 'dictates' the cost. It's a negotiation. Whether it's up front at a honda dealership in an all out dickering war, or more removed on a larger economic scale (ie, if saturn can't sell at it's price, the price drops, or the company stops building them), it remains a negotiated value controlled by market forces. To think that the consumer controls price is ludicrous. If the consumer controled price, then cars would be *free*...And no one would build cars. 
rec.autos	 Place your hands flat on a table, and arrange the firing order from left to right. 
rec.autos	 Makes sense, since the new Mercedes Benz engines go from 2.2L-4 to a 2.8L-6. Nothing in between. BTW, I beleive the numbers on those MB engines are 156 and 225 hp respectively. The one-upmanship in hp might induce BMW to create a larger six. Also, the 2.6 190E has lagged behind the 3-er 2.5 for some time wrt hp. I am sure the Bavarians wouldn't want to be "shown-up" by the Schwabians. 
rec.autos	 Here in Houston last year a woman heard the sound of someone in her garage, so she went to investigate with a gun in her hand. She found a guy in the process of stealing her bicycle. She quite reasonably asked him to stop. He refused, began taunting her, and as the woman was quoted in the police report, "He told me to go ahead and shoot him, so I did." The moron survived, and no charges were filed against the woman. 
rec.autos	 Dont get me wrong, I love to drive in the left lane fast but when I overtake cars who are on the right, I slow down a tad bit. If I were to rely on the judgement of the other car, to recognize the speed differential, I would be the stupid one. 
rec.autos	 Consumer Reports once wrote about the S-10 Blazer that it "shook and rattled like a tired taxi cab". There is one noise that is expecially irritating - the back window squeaks. I believe its because the whole tailgate assembly and window are not solid. Anyway, has anyone had the same problem, and have you found any fixes? 
rec.autos	 Two shots at it: (1) Check the tires again - if you can see the wear bars, you're down to problem area (and some tires pass a penny test between the bars - that's no guide at all). Your problem in the wet is call hydroplaning. You may not have enough tread left to channel water out from under the tire - so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off the road. 
rec.autos	 Keep up the good work guys. Afterall the cops need to be occupied with someone so that lesser mortals like us can be left alone. Bhaskar@orion.me.uiuc.edu 
rec.autos	 The 1941 Lincoln Continental was the first car to sport the "continental kit." The continental kit is not to be confused with ye olde outside mounting bracket; a continental kit is a very specific ornament/storage compartment. (The 1941 Continental has a neat trunk; it looks rather like a laundry hamper, IMHO. :-) 
rec.autos	 You'll have fun looking for the rear-end gears on an SHO--the Taurus is a front-wheel-drive vehicle... 
rec.autos	 they are pretty much junk, stay away from them. they will be replaced next year with all new models. 
rec.autos	 On the cars mentioned - 3 series from the late 80's the "electronic" odometer is really a mechanical drum type odometer, that is driven by pulses from a speed sensor on the rear axle. These pulses are converted into mechanical pulses that turn the odometer - and speedometer. No way changing or erasing an eprom is going to change the mileage reading. It also means the odometer is just as easy (or hard) to change as any other mechanical odometer. 
rec.autos	 on wednesday morning, another driver decided to illegally turn left in front of me, doing great damage to my car (Honda Civic). i have yet to pay off the car, and the body shop says the insurance company wants to total the car. i haven't been able to get in touch with the person handling my claim, so i checked on some things: 
rec.autos	 A list of options that would be useful. They can be existing options on a car, or things you'd like to have... 
rec.autos	 The idea here is to list pointless options. You know, stuff you get on a car that has no earthly use? 
rec.autos	 just to satiate my curiosity, why would this make you the stupid one? It seems to me, everybody SHOULD be aware enough of what is going on. You do not need to calculate the future position. You need to look at your mirrors a little more. If you glance around, you will be able to tell how much faster than you the car is going. Maybe not precisely, but well enough to know if you should let him around before you try to pass. I know what you are talking about, about the other driver being startled, because i myself have been startled by drivers cruising by at around 90-100mph when i'm doin 55-65. The problem, though, as i saw it, was not their fault for barreling around me, but my fault for not paying the attention to my task-at-hand that i should have been. Oddly enough, since the 2nd time(happened 2x in around 4 mo. when i'd had my liscence for around 6 mo), i haven't been startled..and i've been passed by cars doing roughly twice the speed of my car. Another odd occurance is the fact that this only seems to happen on LONG trips...and if i drive along with them, it doesn't happen at all :-) even on the long trips! :-) (adrenaline will do that to you...i've had bad cop experiences with speeding, so anything over the limit is adrenalizing for me...scared i'll get caught :-) Maybe they should raise the limit, so we can pay better attention..... 
rec.autos	 I can relate to this. I've tried everything on my 86, greasing every point, WD40, etc. Grease on the two cheap hinges on the tailgate seems to quiet it down for a time, until the grease works out of the hinges. (Hinge pins appear to be made out of 16 penny nails!) 
rec.autos	 I just ordered a Saturn SL1 after considering a few imports. Frankly, the Saturn way of doing business and service was a *very* big plus. I hadn't bought a new car since I bought my Honda 4WD back in '85, and I was unbelieveably offended by most salespeople I met. 
rec.autos	 I have to disagree with this. I have a 92 Z28 with a 350 and a 4-speed auto w/ overdrive, and it is really better that way. Chevy autos are reknowned for their long life and ability to handle copious amount of power. I live in the Dallas area, and a manual would be much harder to drive in the traffic here. Now if I still lived out in the sticks like I used to, a manual would be more fun. 
rec.autos	 That shows how much you know about anything. The brakes on the SHO are very different - 9 inch (or 9.5? I forget) discs all around, vented in front. The normal Taurus setup is (smaller) discs front, drums rear. 
rec.autos	 Checker Motors went out of business in 1982. It's hard to get old Checkers that are worth restoring, since almost every one was a fleet vehicle that was driven into the ground. If you can get a body in decent shape the mechanicals should all be available _somewhere_ - Checker used whatever parts were around. For instance, I had a Chevy straight six and a GMC Truck radiator and a Ford rear in mine. 
rec.autos	 I am considering buying an new car, so I called three insurance companies in California to get estimates. I asked for the same coverage and same deductibles. Most of the companies charge you according to your zip code. Others charge according to your city. Anyhow, I gave the same zip code and city to all three places. Here's what I found (for a '93 Integra GS): 
rec.autos	 Joni Ciarletta writes My Honda Accord just hit the magic 100,000 mile mark and now all sorts of things are beginning to go bad. The latest problem I am experiencing is with my brakes. They still stop the car fine, but once I am stopped completely, my brake pedal will sink another 2 or 3 inches all by itself. If feels really strange, and I am worried my brakes will quit working one of these days. 
rec.autos	 A list of options that would be useful. They can be existing options on a car, or things you'd like to have... 
rec.autos	 Now, my ego with regards to my shifting ability is as big as anyone else's, but I just ordered my first car with an auto trans. I wasn't planning on it; but after driving a few I was convinced: Things have changed since the days of "Slip 'n' Slide Withe Powerglide". They shift *better* than I do, there's no clutch to wear out (Honda wanted $800 for my 4WD wagon last year!- got it done for $500), it only costs about 5% in gas milage on the highway and it makes it easier to concentrate on all the radios in my car ;-) 
rec.autos	 I'm surprised. I know of a local case where a guy took his Saturn back five times to complain they hadn't properly eliminated a rattling noise...so Saturn gave him a new car. 
rec.autos	 one i saw had vented rears too...it was on a lot. of course, the sales man was a fool..."titanium wheels"..yeah, right.. then later told me they were "magnesium"..more believable, but still crap, since Al is so m uch cheaper, and just as good.... 
rec.autos	 all of my HO's disagree with your HO's. I LOVED Dallas rush hour in my stick.. detested it in the auto(like i did any other time in the auto...). Of course, Dalls rush hours are nothing, from what i hear..if i lived in LA, i might be of a different persuasion. And, just for the record, rarely do you shift gears when merging into traffic..that is what 5 speeds are good for..4th is good up through around 80-90, most of the time, so you can just wind it out.. it's not going to hurt anything, and keeps it in the powerband anyway.. only shift into top gear when you are exceeding redline in 4th(fairly rare, unless you drive a ferrari or some such, i'd bet) or when you hit cruising speed where you feel comfortable(or when my mother is sitting in the passanger seat complaining about how you wind her "poor little engine" way too hi :-)' "Just my HO's.. 
rec.autos	 All you have to do is turn it in to the police like you would an accident, get a report and send it in to your insurance company and they will contact the other guys insurance company and they will have to pay just as they would in an accident they caused. Thus no need to go to court. A friend of mine did this and he got the money so it does work. 
rec.autos	 Yes, I saw a 200 Turbo Quattro wagon on I-287 in NJ on Monday. I thought Audi stopped selling wagons in the US after the 5000. This is exactly the type of vehicle I would like to own. I bet its price is 4-5 times my car budget. 
rec.autos	 However, if you agree some terms, and then, when about to sign, the dealer slips you a contract with different terms, and leads you to believe that it embodies the terms you verbally agreed to, that is fraud. There is no 3 day limit on restitution for fraud.

rec.autos	 Actually, this started as a great idea. Before steering-column locks became popular, Saab installed a *gearshift* lock -- put the car in reverse, remove the key, and the car *stays* in reverse! Also, suppose you get into your car, and a thug comes up and demands your keys at gunpoint. You hand them over, he gets in, and HAS NO IDEA WHERE TO PUT THE KEY! At this, he will run away (or perhaps shoot you anyway %-}). I heard this actually happened somewhere... Btw, I hear that the Saab 900's new successor will have the ignition on the console, between the seats, where it belongs. 
rec.autos	 But waiiiiiit, isn't Nissan officially registering the car as far as government paperwork goes, Nissan Stanza Altima, to avoid costly and lengthy paperwork? I read this on the net a while ago, and someone actually may have said there's a little Stanza logo on the Altima somewhere. 
rec.autos	 The federal government has mandated that all passenger cars by model year '95 return to the floor mounted dimmer switch. 
rec.autos	 Based on my experience with a '79 FJ40 ( the hard-top jeep-style model ) I would definitely give a new model consideration if I were in the market. The older models are VERY well built. Unless Toyota lost its mind, I would assume, until proven otherwise, that the newer models have inherited some if not all of the qualities of their ancestors. 
rec.autos	 You raise a valid point, but again it's a tradeoff -- how much money do you want to spend for that kind of protection? You could buy a Volvo, Saab, or 'Benz and get really good crash protection (and other luxuries) but you'll pay significantly more for it. In my case it's out of the question because *all* of those cars are beyond my budget. 
rec.autos	 The big win with the V-1 is not its range but rather its directionality and multiple-transmitter tracking (which you later called a "gimmick" -- a conclusion I disagree with). Since the detector incorporates multiple receivers it's not surprising that it's significantly more expensive. While the added capabilities may not help you, there is added value for those of us who live in areas where there are a lot of false-alarms. 
rec.autos	 And better yet..There's a chevette in town with wire crome wheels, vinyl roof, tacky paint job and a continental spare (showing the wire crome wheel within, of course)...I'm scared to look on the inside and have only seen it rolling down the road...and I too was glad I hadn't just ate. 
rec.autos	 Something that happened in South AFrica about a year ago: A dealer sold a Mercedes with an odometer reading of 150K kilometers to a lady. Turned out that the actual reading should have been 160K. Court case followed because lady said she wouldn't have bought a car with that much km's. Dealer found quilty, fined and had to take back the car. 
rec.autos	 As a matter of interest does anyone know why autos are so popular in the US while here in Europe they are rare??? Just wondering..... 
rec.autos	 I had the same problem in my '90 MX-6. Luckily I had it fixed under warranty. I think they replaced a tail light gasket. Check with a dealer, it's a known problem. 
rec.autos	 If it looks like a miniature corvette it would be an opel GT,the headlights are flipped over by pulling a lever inside.

rec.autos	 Yes this is a common problem. The leaks occur through the seal of the taillights. Unfortunately, Ford has this with Most Probes and does not have a recall for it. Very dissatisfying to say the least. 
rec.autos	 Good point. I have no idea how either of my Hondas will handle at 100+ mph, nor do they reach 155. However, using `high' to be 70-90 mph:

rec.autos	 Junk? They've made the C&D lists for years due to their excellent handling and acceleration. They have been around since about, oh, 85 or 86, so they're not the newest on the lot, and mileage is about five to eight MPG under the class leader. You can get into a 3.0 L v-6 (141 hp) Shadow for $10~11K (the I-4 turbo a bit more), and a droptop for $14~15K. 
rec.autos	 My wife and I looked at, and drove one last fall. This was a 1992 model. It was WAYYYYYYYYY underpowered. I could not imagine driving it in the mountains here in Colorado at anything approaching highway speeds. I have read that the new 1993 models have a newer, improved hp engine. 
rec.autos	 I'm considering switching to Geico insurance, but have heard that they do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim. I was worried that this might be a real pain when you make a claim. I have also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident. 
rec.autos	 Well, I was just in your position and I drove all three and liked all three. It was a toss-up. I marginally went with the Pathfinder based on reliability and looks. 
rec.autos	 I find this method much better myself, too, although I do really hate it when the bolt finally comes loose and the wrench and my hand both come crashing into my face. After coming to, which is about 15 minutes later, I change my clothes (because by this time all the oil has drained *on* me), and ice my entire face and suck down about 20 Tylenol to ease the pain. Later in the day I then proceed with refilling the engine oil. 
rec.autos	 greetings: you may be in luck. i seem to recall seeing a blurb in one of the kit car magazines about a company in norway who pulled a mould (sp?) off a real kubel, and has adapted it to the beetle floorpan. as for the suspension, all i can remember about the vw thing i used to own is that it had about 3" more suspension travel than a stock beetle, but i'd heard that there were after- market parts for off-road use that were as good or better. note that the major difference (looks wise) between a kubel & a thing are the hood and the fenders. the kubel had an external spare mounted *on* the hood, and the hood sloped down (for visibility?) sharply, and had rounded fenders. the thing has a lightly sloped hood with the spare mounted inside (unless moved to make for more luggage space...) and has half-hexagon shaped fenders (imagine a nut large enough to put a tire *in*, and cut off the bottom half of it...). unfortunately, i don't have that info anymore. try stopping at a local bookstore and copying down the phone numbers for the two big mag's and calling them. they might be able to get the number for you (don't forget to calculate the time difference to norway before calling...). 
rec.autos	 think again!! thanks to 60 minutes (tick tick tick), used 200 quattros are bargains.. '89s go for about $15K, '90s go for perhaps 1 or 2K more, the 20 valve 91's are quite a bit more because of an enormous hp and torque gain.. i think they go for about $23 to $25K if you can find one. i have seen quite a lot of '89-'90 200 quattros (not that many wagons though) at the dealer lot.. they use very high quality paint and the entire car is zinc galvanized, so it will never rust. 
rec.autos	 x x Fake convertible roofs and vinyl roofs. x Any gold trim. x x These, I will agree, are abominations, right along with the fake xcontinental spare-tire kit -- it's sad watching those little old ladies xtry to load their groceries into the trunk with that huge tire-medallion xin the way. x Most pitiful fake convertible top: on a "Cadillac" Cimarron, with xall the chrome door trim still visible -- not fooling *anyone*. xOf course, there was that Hyundai Excel I once saw... x Least you think bad taste is something new: Back in the early 1970s I saw a couple of cars with *flocked* paint jobs. Thats not a typo. I think they sprayed on some kind of glue then blew on tiny pieces of nylon. It comes out looking like felt. Can you picture a huge Plymouth Fury III in dark blue felt? I think I can even remember one guy who did it in red to a early 1960s Corvette. That was after he had turned it into a station wagon. 
rec.autos	 Sometimes a bad choke pull-off diaphram will cause a car to fast idle. The pull-off, which is vacuum actuated, provides a necessary pull in non-cold weather conditions to get the idle off the the fast idle cam. Locate the fast idle cam on your vehicle and see if you can rotate it to produce a normal idle. If so, locate the diaphram and test it. If you can't apply suction (via a good piece of rubber vacuum hose) with your mouth that will cause the diaphram to retract, then it's bad and should be replaced. 
rec.autos	 I've got an 89 GT. It has the smoked taillight assembly. I think this is where the water is getting in. When I first got it (had it for a month), one of the rear taillights fogged up with moisture. I took it in to the dealer and they replaced the entire assembly. It happened to the other one about 3 months later. This time I happened to look in the spare tire well and noticed water standing in there. The dealer was more reluctant this time to replace it. But I convinced them to fix it. (They must have had to deal with a number of other probes with the same problem.) I haven't noticed water in the taillamps (or the trunk) for the last 2.5 years, but just last month, the taillamp just fogged up again. I'm going to try to take it back to get them to fix it again. I'm real tempted to drill some vent and drain holes in the tops and bottoms of the assembly and forget about it. This is getting very annoying. (Almost every other `89 GT I've seen has had this problem.) 
rec.autos	 These substitutes exist, and at this time are available. Its the future availability that is in doubt. 
rec.autos	 HELP!!! my wife has informed me that she wants a convertible for her next car. We live in South Fla., so we are definitely in the right are for one. My wife has mentioned the Miata, but I think it is too small. I would like to wait for the new Mustangs ( Dec. '93 I think). Anyone have any opinions on any/all convertibles in a reasonable price range. 
rec.autos	 Since this posting, I've received no replies or followups, so I'm posting here hoping for the feedback I didn't get in rec.audio.car: 
rec.autos	 I think you mean late '60s. The biggest change that Porsche undertook to alter the tailhappieness of their baby was way back in August 1968 (for the '69 model year) when they stretched the wheelbase. Besides, some people actually _KNOW_ how to take advantage of oversteer, and enjoy it. 
rec.autos	 I don't know if it's as much an issue of their ablility to handle the power as it is the power they lose (in the torque converter, etc). 
rec.autos	 Don't worry about leaks. Don't worry about which way to turn the damn thing. Take a good claw hammer and pry it straight out. Now, you'll notice, after all the oil pours out, that there are no theads where there used to be. 
rec.autos	 would be safe at 55-65. Roads like the Autobahn are smoother, straiter, wider and slightly banked. 
rec.autos	 I'm wondering if anybody else out there is a clutchless shifter? I've been doing it my self over 200,000 miles, on my current toyota truck I've got over 150k. I've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a transmission. My experiences suggest otherwise. What techniques do you use? 
rec.autos	 Ah, we are looking for good people just like you. We are a very concerned group of citizens who are absolutely disgusted at the way that the majority of drivers simply disobey traffic rules like going above the speed limit, passing on our right, and riding our tails, while all the while we respectfully abide by the rules of this great country and maintain the mandated speed limits with our calibrated, certified cruise controls, while keeping the respectful 1.5 car length distance/10 mph speed. How many times have you been ticked off by some moron who jumps ahead in the (5.5 * 1.5)8.25 car lengths that you have left between you and the vehicle ahead of you while driving 55 mph? Finally you have an option.

rec.autos	 I was whatching The History Of The Indy 500 the other day, and early in the film, around the '10-'20's, a name, Lois Chevrolet, came out of the blue. I wanted to know if he is THE Chevrolet founder or mearly a driver who's name was called the same as the other guy's?:^) 
rec.autos	 I offered to relay this information for a ham friend of mine without Internet access: 
rec.autos	 o Subaru Service Manuals ................................... $10.00 This is not a complete set, but includes sections 4, 5 & 6 which cover MECHANICAL COMPONENTS (suspension, wheels & axles, steering, brakes, pedals & control cables, heater & ventilator, air conditioning), BODY (body & exterior, doors & windows, seats, seat belts, interior, instrument panel), and ELECTRICAL (engine electrical system, body electrical system, wiring diagram, and trouble-shooting). These are the genuine Subaru issue manuals. They are for model year 1986, but have plenty of good information that applies to other years as well. 
rec.autos	 I am interested in finding out how the 4Runner and Pathfinder have been updated in the past few years. Like new engine, suspension and the like. I noticed that the 1993 and 1992 4Runners are identical, for example, and was looking into buying a used one. 
rec.autos	 As an ex-Fleet Mgr. of 3000 cars, they were amoung the most trouble free of all models. I bought one for my wife. 
rec.autos	 You can also just put the detector off to the side on the dash so the cop doesn't see it right away...Valentine is the best detector by far (as stated by Car and Driver) and even tells you what direction the radar is coming from. It also gives the amount of "threats" it is picking up, so if you go through the same place everyday, and it always goes off there, you can glance at the number of "threats" the Valentine is detecting to see if it is a genuine cop. It's about $300 and you can only get it factory direct..one problem. Rob Fusi rwf2@lehigh.edu 
rec.autos	 I used to have a '67 Galaxie convertible, was sitting at a light waiting for it to turn green. It turned green, but I hesitated a little (sleeping I guess) and a bird bombed me, it landed directly in front of me at eye level, I guess the bird miscalculated and thought I was going to take off right away. 
rec.autos	 I want to start of list for Syclone and Typhoon owners. If you are interested in participating, please contact me via e-mail. 
rec.autos	 The Olds Supreme Convertible got high marks in C/D's recent test, if you can get by the stupid body moldings and stuff. The Saab 900 ragtop may be out of your range, but its a good choice. Is there a new F-car convertible? The Nissan 240SX convertible is a nice car also... Those immediately come to mind... 
rec.autos	 The best auto-shifters on the street (AND NOT THE TRACK) are those from Porsche... they wont change if you floor the gas during a turn.... a few years back a was in a 200SX auto (you guys call it a 240SX [without turbo]) and was going round a corner.... I floored it and next thing I know I was pointing backwards! The other drivers seemed quite amused ;-) 
rec.autos	 Dumbest options? Well here in the UK, BMW offer a 'no-smokers' option... It just means they take the fag lighter out.... big deal.... 
rec.autos	 Not to mention my friend's '54 Citroen Traction Avant with the light switch and dimmer integrated in a single stalk off the steering column! Those dumb French were apparently copying the Japanese before the Germans! :^) 
rec.autos	 While previous Volvos have been essentially very fast tractors, the 3,4 and 8 series are far from 'agricultural' in design or execution (how many FWD tractors have you seen?).

rec.autos	 What do you mean by "all models", all models of cars, all Chrysler models, all models that the fleet manager had bought? Because there is no way in hell that the Shadow is the most reliable car of all models sold, not even Chrysler's dept. of lies, damned lies and statistics would claim that. 
rec.autos	 you can say that again. how does $23 for a new thermostat sound?

rec.autos	 I have a '71 Buick Skylark with 148K on it. I bought it in California, and if it'll let me, I'd like to keep it for another year. The only problem is these Indiana winters--my heater controls don't work. 
rec.autos	 True 914 enthusiasts will be able to give you a better answer then this but I'll dump my impressions. I've wanted to own a 914 for about 10 years now; came close once but I ended up buying a Fiero instead (biggest mistake of my life!) 
rec.autos	 Well, I heard that Militech stuff works pretty good too.. One of my friends who races in SCCA sanctioned events and all that stuff got the Militech stuff early as a trial thing, and he put it in his CRX.. He says it worked great, but I didn't ask him for any details.

rec.autos	 There was a Volvo owner that had $3000 dollars worth of improvements to the looks of the car by hail :). 
rec.autos	 Carrying a pistol, loaded or unloaded, in the glove compartment, is considered carrying a concealed weapon in Colorado and is illegal without a concealed weapons permit. Unless the law has been changed recently, carrying a weapon openly is legal in Colorado but concealing it is illegal. I read a newspaper account last year where police stopped a car on a traffic infraction and observed a .357 magnum revolver sitting on the seat. The driver could not be cited for possessing or carrying the weapon because it was not concealed. The article stated that if the gun had been discovered in the glove box, it would have been considered a crime. 
rec.autos	 I prefer a manual to an automatic as it should be. I believe that automatics should only be manufactured for people with physical disabilities who otherwise would not be able to drive. Automatic transmissions allow drivers to be lazy. More time is available to fiddle with the radio or to look at the scenery instead of concentrating on the road. The manual transmission keeps the drive always doing something, granted it isn't a large movement. Plus, driving should be FUN! Driving a manual is fun, driving an automatic is a chore. In the case of shift speed, automatics can be made to shift far faster that any human could move a stick. If I was racing, I'd want and automatic. For normal driving go with the manual. 
rec.autos	 The part about spending $5000-7000 on repairs reminds me of an article I read in a magazine comparing the 5 year ownership costs of a Toyota Camry and a Ford Taurus or something like that. The result, which they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at the end of the period. That was their argument to prove that you don't go wrong buying the Ford Taurus over the Camry. 
rec.autos	 As you can see, I have two 1987 cars, both worth about $3000 each. The problem is that maintenance costs on these two cars is running about $4000 per year and insurance $3000 per year. 
rec.autos	 Gads, I have heard so many horror stories with Taurus and Sable cars! I thought these were premium American automobiles. The way they sell, you'd think so. Is Ford really no better than in the late '70s when it was turning out tin cans like the Granada and the Fairmount? Which would you get, a Taurus or a Camry or Accord? 
rec.autos	 It has some of the most impressive performance figures around, and automotive magazines eat it up. One car to seriously consider in that price range. 
rec.autos	 For an all out sports car, I'd go for the RX-7 without the sports suspension (which is too stiff.) For a little more practicality and more comfort, the Nissan 300ZX Turbo is a good buy. And for a good dose of luxury, the Lexus SC300 is perfect (with a manual transmission of course.) However, the Toyota Supra is coming out soon and if you like it's looks, the performance is supposed to be great, almost race car like. I don't particulary like the Mitsubishi 3000GT's or the Dodge Stealths as they are too heavy and aren't very nimble handlers for a sports car. 
rec.autos	 Actually I wasn't too surprised, since I bought it with the rust. Any of you got some ideas of getting rid of this CHEAPLY (key word)?? It has eaten all the way through on the door panels. Can I use Bondo? 
rec.autos	 Well, yes, the exhaust is where the majority of the noise comes out, but the basics (tone, firing cadence, etc.) are determined by the engine configuration. In the case of the Viper, yes, we are discussing a HUGE multicylinder 90-deg. engine, which will sound somewhat like a truck. And my understanding, btw, is that that V-10 engine was designed originally with the intention of being ad- aptible for either the trucks or the Viper. And from what I've heard (no first hand knowledge :-( ) it's doing a pretty good job at both. 
rec.autos	 Hi, I was looking for some helpful advice. I'm a university student with about $7000 to spend, and I'm looking for a used car. Does anyone have any useful advice they could offer to a first- time buyer? I'm not looking for anything sporty, just something functional and reliable (less maintenance costs). Anybody have any ideas on what models might suit me? 
rec.autos	 did you account for depreciation? i seriously doubt that a taurus would rack up an extra $4000 in repair costs over 5 years. 
rec.autos	 james, i really hate to do this, but try reading the damn posts! never was a t'bird mentioned. The discussion was about SHO's and 'stangs not being up to spec. I do not know about t'birds. I only know that the specs quoted for the SHO by previous poster sounded a little anemic for me to say that it was up to snuff. This does not in any way disencourage* me from wishing to own one, nor does it make it a bad car. It merely means that i think Ford could have added that extra bit of safety and tossed in larger brakes, as the wheels are plenty large enough for them to fit (if memory serves right, which it may very well not) and the motor plenty powerful enough to need it. 
rec.autos	 I can't tell if Matt is being sarcastic here or not, but to be honest, many automobiles are worth far more to their owners (in $$ value and $$ investment) than the people that would take them. I don't have figures on average property tax in the U.S. or how much of it is allocated for housing projects, inferior public schools, jails, or the like, but I have a feeling that the amount the government steals from an honest, productive citizen to breed this trash is significantly less than the value of many automobiles. And for those who will argue that the animals out there stealing cars and everything else (not to mention committing COMPLETELY senseless acts of violence, such as rape) cannot be valued in terms of money because they are human beings, I submit that they are not human beings. Jim Callison, I think, is on the right track. And Chintan Amin remarked earlier that we cannot blame environment for the actions of a single criminal. I couldn't agree more. One could trace any crime back to the environment/upbringing of the criminal; should we let all of them out, from pickpockets to rapists to inside traders, because what they did wasn't their fault? Where does one draw the line?

rec.autos	 W/r/t performance, converter lockup is purely irrelevant. The lockup only occurs at light throttle settings and serves only to improve MPG. Mind you, a converter clutch does a lovely job of improving MPG, but the additional mechanical advantage of the converter gives you more acceleration (vs. locked converter clutch) than its inherent losses take away. 
rec.autos	 According to _The Complete Guide To Specialty Cars_, 7th Edition, from Crown Publishing, it's the VW Kubelwagen (w/ 2 dots over the 'u'). The company is: 
rec.autos	 Thanks to a reply from someone I looked a little further and found what I was looking for. The April CR magazine has most of the above things. Despite recent articles here the ratings looked pretty good for relative comparison purposes. Unfortunately the crash test comparisons didn't include half of the cars I'm comparing. Anybody know how '93 Honda Civic hatchbacks and Toyota Tercels fare in an accident?

rec.motorcycles	 You got off cheap. My sister's ex-boyfriend was such an incessant pain in the ass about wanting to ride my bikes (no way, Jose) that I finally took him to Lindner's BMW in New Canaan, CT last fall where I had seen a nice, used K100RS in perfect condition. After telling everyone in the shop his Norton war stories from fifteen years ago, signing the liability waiver, and getting his pre-flight, off he went... 
rec.motorcycles	 I am happy to say that some Harley riders in our area are better than most that are flamed about here: I (riding a lowly sport bike, no less) and my girlfriend were the recipient of no less than twenty waves from a group of at least twenty-five Harley riders. I was leading a group of about four sport bikes at the time (FJ1200/CBR900RR/VFR750). I initiated *some* of the waves, but not all. It was a perfect day, and friendly riders despite some brand differences made it all the better... 
rec.motorcycles	 How about a Geeky temporary tatoo? I mean, why should the RUBs be exempt from a little razzing. 
rec.motorcycles	 I must say, that the courtesy of a nod or a wave as I meet other bikers while riding does a lot of good things to my mood... While riding is a lot of fun by itself, there's something really special about having someone say to you "Hey, it's a great day for a ride... Isn't it wonderful that we can spend some time on the road on days like this..." with a gesture.

rec.motorcycles	 I don't think the 550 sold very well - most North Americans who ride a standard rather than a sport bike usually want something bigger. People walk into the dealership, look at the 550 and the 750 and say, "I might as well spring the extra bucks for the bigger engine."

rec.motorcycles	 I dunno, on my old GS1000E the tank-seat junction was nice and smooth. But if you were to travel all the way forward, you'd collect the top triple-clamp in a sensitive area. I'd hate to have to make the choice, but I think I'd prefer the FJ's gas tank. :-) 
rec.motorcycles	 the cop won't show up. Secondly, if he does show up, you should point out that he lied (purgered) on the ticket. Why 70+? I beleive that if yo're charged with going more than 15mph that the posted speed it's a more severe ticket. You couldn't have p[ossibly been going 70+, right?! 
rec.motorcycles	 What's the feeling about eating and riding? I went out riding this weekend, and got a little carried away with some pecan pie. The whole ride back I felt sluggish. I was certainly much more alert on the ride in. I'm sure others have the same feeling, but the strangest thing is that eating is usually the turnaround point of weekend rides.

rec.motorcycles	 It depends on how badly you want to live. The FAA says "eight hours, bottle to throttle" for pilots but recommends twenty-four hours. The FARs specify a blood/alcohol level of 0.4 as legally drunk, I think, which is more than twice as strict as DWI minimums.

rec.motorcycles	 Check with the local fire department. My buddy is a firefighter and they have these small map books which are Amazing! They are compact, easy to use (no folding). They even have a cross reference section in which you match your current cross streets with the cross streets you want to go to and it details the quickest route. They gave me an extra they had laying around. But then again I know all those people I'm not really sure if they are supposed to give/sell them. (The police may also have something similar).

rec.motorcycles	 I ride my bike regularly to classes with my book bag. I take the shoulder straps on the bag, and hook them around the rear turn signals. I works fine. You probably will want to attach it with a bungee cord to keep it from shifting to one side or another.

rec.motorcycles	 That's absurd! That statement must therefore say that any argument in favor of seatbelts or airbags is an argument against automobiles. Any argument for lifeguards is an argument against swimming. It says that any agrgument in favor of safety precautions is an argument for banning the activity to which the precautions apply. Extrapolating to that degree is ridiculous, there wouldn't be any normal human activity left to do; therefore it is a non-seqitur. 
rec.motorcycles	 Next time make the numbers more believable -- this is poor flamebait. 120 DB is getting close to the sound of a jumbo jet engine at takeoff revs from some small number of yards away. It is certainly right around the pain threshold for humans. No way in hell the state permits 110 DB if they have any standard at all. 
rec.motorcycles	 the fancy piggyback shocks on the 550 (and the 750, i think. i don't know about the zr1100) are very nice, 3-way adjustability. the forks are crappy, they dive like MAD. i had progressive springs installed and it made a huge difference. cheap fix, MUCH improvement. 
rec.motorcycles	 It is certainly possible, and quite easy in most cases, especially on two-strokes. It's very common to do this on bikes where the cylinder-mounting through-studs don't prevent the cylinder from being removed with the engine in the frame. I did this when I assembled the top end on my Indian, which was easier yet because it does not have through-studs. Base flange studs, and separate head bolts, dontchaknow. You have to use a little foresight, rags, duct tape, etc. to keep clips from falling in, clothespins, hoseclamps, etc. to support the cylinder while you're inserting the pins. (Are these called Gudgeon Pins in the UK? If so, what's a Gudgeon?)

rec.motorcycles	 What a great day! Got back home last night from some fantastic skiing in Colorado, and put the battery back in the FXSTC. Cleaned the plugs, opened up the petcock, waited a minute, hit the starter, and bingo it started up like a charm! Spent a restless night anticipating the first ride du saison, and off I went this morning to get my state inspection done. Now my bike is stock (so far) except for HD slash-cut pipes, and all went well with my New Hampshire State Inspection (meaning all my lights worked OK) until the dude produces a decibel meter and tells me about the new NH law about MC noise.....huh? sez I....and he has me start her up and rev to about 3000 rpm....I FAIL cuz I register 120 DB, and the max allowed is 110! If I fail with these pipes, there are gonna be a whole lotta seriously pissed off bikers round here when they go for inspection. 
rec.motorcycles	 According to BBC Radio this morning, UK, Denmark, Portugal & a few others have vetoed a proposal to limit EC-sold bikes to 100 BHP. The reason is that such a limit is not supported by accident statistics - a rare example of governmental wisdom. The limit has a five year moratorium on it, and "specialist" manufacturers will be exempt anyway. Any suspicion that this is a crafty trick to restrict that end of the market in Europe to Triumph, Norton (who? :-)), BMW, Cagiva & Ducati is the sort of dangerous rubbish which stalls GATT talks. 
rec.motorcycles	 Right on, it is every citizen's right and duty to FORCE government accountability.

rec.motorcycles	 I was wondering if anybody knows anything about a Yamaha Seca Turbo. I'm considering buying a used 1982 Seca Turbo for $1300 Canadian (~$1000 US) with 30,000 km on the odo. This will be my first bike. Any comments? 
rec.motorcycles	 Be VERY careful about this. If youre really cold the muffler will feel fine till you leave all the charred skin on it when you peel your hands off - I speak from experience. You can also do all kindsa (Americanism of the day) damage to your circulation warming hands up on something too hot. By far the best (fastest and safest) way to do it is to shove the hands up the opposit sleeves and stand there like a Ming emporer for a while. Five minutes should do it. 
rec.motorcycles	 One thing is certain, though, its still too cold. After about 40 minutes, I had to stop and hold my muffler for a while. When I got home after a few hours, I kept all my gear on for about a half hour in the house. 40F, 100% humidity, no wind protection, and 75mph do not mix well. 
rec.motorcycles	 Yeah, hypothermia is MUCH more detrimemtal to your judgement and reactions than people realise. I wish I had the patience to stop when I should. One day I'll pay for it.... 
rec.motorcycles	 This is a piece of psychology its essential for any long term biker to understand. People do NOT think 'if I do this will someone else suffer?'. They assess things purely on' if I do this will I suffer?. 
rec.motorcycles	 To maintain my senses at their sharpest, I never eat a full meal within 24 hrs of a ride. I've tried Slim Fast Lite before a ride but found that my lap times around the Parliament Buildings suffered 0.1 secs. The resultant 70 pound weight loss over the summer just sharpens my bike's handling and I can always look forward to a winter of carbo-loading. 
rec.motorcycles	 Because of this I cannot in good faith recommend a Seca Turbo. Power delivery is too uneven for a novice. The Official (tm) Dod newbie bike of choice would be more appropriate because the powerband is so wide and delivery is very smooth. Perfect for the beginner. 
rec.motorcycles	 I told a newbie friend of mine, who was having trouble from the complicated explanations of his rider course, to think of using the handlebars to lean, not to turn. Push the right handlebar "down" (or pull left up or whatever) to lean right. It worked for him, he stopped steering with his tuchus. 
rec.motorcycles	 My old jacket is about to bite the dust so I'm in the market for a new riding jacket. I'm looking for recommendations for a suitable replacement. I would like to buy a full Aerostich suit but I can't afford $700 for it right now. 
rec.motorcycles	 Hi, I just have a small question about my bike. Being a fairly experienced BMW and MZ-Mechanic, I just don't know what to think about my Honda. She was using too much oil for the last 5000 km (on my trip to Daytona bike week this spring), and all of a sudden, she trailed smoke like hell and was running only on one cylinder. I towed the bike home and took it apart, but everything looks in perfect working order. No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look very clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All still within factory specs. The only thing I could find, however, was a slightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem), but it is still way below the wear-limit given in the Clymer-manual for this bike. Any syggestions??? What else could cause my problem??? Do I have to hone the cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in order to get better breaking in of my new rings??? Won't that increase the wear of my pistons?? Please send comments to sruhl@mechanical.watstar.uwaterloo.ca Thanks in advance. Stef.

In my case, I had a faded cover stolen off a bmw R100RS that was stashed in an apartment carport and not visible from the street. They evidently decided the beemer wasn't worth stealing, but did try the next night to steal a Honda Hurricane 600 parked in the next apartment building.

rec.motorcycles	 Not with a hub cap but one of those "Lumber yard delivery trucks" made life interesting when he hit a 'dip' in the road and several sheets of sheetrock and a dozen 5 gallon cans of spackle came off at 70 mph. It got real interesting for about 20 seconds or so. Had to use a wood mallet to get all the dried spackle off Me, the Helmet and the bike when I got home. Thanks to the bob tail Kenworth between me and the lumber truck I had a "Path" to drive through he made with his tires (and threw up the corresponding monsoon from those tires as he ran over what ever cans of spackle didn't burst in impact). A car in front of me in the right lane hit her brakes, did a 360 and nailed a bridge abutment half way through the second 360.

rec.motorcycles	 Would anyone out there in DoDland be able to help me out in giving me a contact to purchase a pair of military air-borne combat boots (9 1/2 D in size).

I admit I have not gone into the deepest bowels of NYC yet for the search but I have made some calls to several of the bigger army/navy type stores with no luck. 
rec.motorcycles	 I've ridden one twice. It was designed to be a monster in a straight line, which it is. It has nothing on an FZR400 in the corners. In fact, it just didn't handle that well at all in curves. But hey, that's not what it was designed to do. My two cents, Alan

rec.motorcycles	 I can't think of another subject that generates as much contradictory advice as traffic laws and their enforcement. Everybody's got an opinion and is dead certain they are right. Yet acurate information is extremely difficult to come by. The DMV doesn't know. Cops don't know. Your traffic school instructor doesn't know. The vehicle code only tells part of the story. Judges choose to interpret the laws in a wide variety of ways. And the public at large? I seldom hear any advice that doesn't disagree with something I've experienced.

As for the gargoyles, if you want mine you can have 'em. I think the bridge of my nose holds them too far from my face. Same deal for the two of my friends who tried them. For people who use them with a full face helmet, all bets are off. Sorry if they fit you well and took my complaint personally. Yes the Oakleys are much more desirable squid attire. Also the gargoyles aren't that ugly, even in my opinion, or I wouldn't have tried them.

I guess I should have been a bit more specific. If you have something that weighs that same as the 750, go for the extra cubes.

rec.motorcycles	 My rule of thumb is "Don't give rides to people that wear a bigger helmet than you", unless your taste runs that way, or they are family.friends. Gee, reminds me of a *dancer* in Hull, just over the river from Ottowa, that I saw a few years ago, for her I would a bought a bigger helmet (or even her own bike) or anything else she wanted ;- 
rec.motorcycles	 Currently there are no "Velcro" jump boots as issue in the military, there are two other kinds. One is made my Cochran and sell for $85.00 in either the Clothing sales store or US Cavalry (Price match at the Cav store) the second co is also sold but somewhat cheaper in design. Actually they don't care what you wear as long is they are 10 eyelets high. There is another boot called a "Tankers boot" this has similar construction to a wellington boot except for the boot shape and has straps that wrap around for tightness. Nice boots 
rec.motorcycles	 If I have one thing to say about "No Fault" it would be "It isn't" 
rec.motorcycles	 Animal Rights people have been know to do that to other "Bike riding dogs.cats and Racoons.

rec.motorcycles	 This is pretty damned complicated. I just make a "back off" motion with my hand/arm, and the second or third time even the most braindead cager backs off. If they don't back off then, I find a way to get the hell out of there -- the cager is either psychotic, drunk, or just a complete asshole. In any case, I don't want to be anywhere near, and especially not in front. 
rec.motorcycles	 It sound like to me that your carbs are not jetted properly. If you did it yourself, take it to a shop and get it done right. If a shop did it, get your money back, and go to another shop. 
rec.motorcycles	 For those of you who are thinking about fiamms, you might also want to think about airhorns. I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from Dennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated at 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to the relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay pins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used a crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA. I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube frame used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to do this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two vertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing follows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing. The compressor is about 2" in diameter and about 5" long. The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small so there should be plenty of good places for it. I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to mount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side just in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into. The short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out about an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look closely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight ahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you). If you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try to explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them first. How do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound more like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock. I have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has not blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short). I've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though they know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping the pedestrians on the sidewalk. The bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to those stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives) and are relatively easy to install on the FJ. YMMV. 
rec.motorcycles	 I am looking for advice on buying a susuki GS1100E. does anyone out there know about any inherent flaws the bike may have or problems i should look for? what about insurance rates (is this bike blacklisted)? also, as a person who has never ridden a motorcycle yet is buying a 1100 to start off with.... am I crazy? I have been told by some people to start out small.... and by others that i am lage enough to handle an 1100 right off from the start (6'4" 210 pounds) because some others might be a tad bit small. 
rec.motorcycles	 As you point out, the experiments would be difficult. But we know enough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations. There are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over to begin a turn. 
rec.motorcycles	 I'm looking for a sport-cruiser - factory installed fairings ( full/half ), hard saddle bags, 750cc and above, and all that and still has that sporty look. 
rec.motorcycles	 I hate to admit this but there does seem to be some sort of twisted logic to this approach. It's the bikers against the world and the dogs are just another worthless adversary. So remember to wear at least calf height leather boots, ( in case the dog gets lucky and sinks his teeth into your attacking foot) and go for the gusto, If that dog doesn't retreat from the street with his tail between his legs next time you see it then you really haven't done your bit for all your fellow bikers. 
rec.motorcycles	 OK -- so we've got a hotly contested BMWOA election and some inept leadership. 
rec.motorcycles	 Well, if you want to pick on Morgan, why not attack its ash (wood) frame or its hand-bent metal skin (just try and get a replacement :-)). I thought the kingpost suspension was one of the Mog's better features. 
rec.motorcycles	 Hi. I have been thinking about buying a Motorcycle or a while now and I have some questions: 
rec.motorcycles	 I have a problem with the battery on my '83 Honda CB650 NightHawk. Every week or so it is dead and I have to recharge it. I ride the bike every day, the battery is new and the charging system was checked thoroughly and it seems fine. My suspicion is that it is draining somewhere. 
rec.motorcycles	 The problem is that Squids and BadAssBikers can't recognize each other's waves. When you're riding a cruiser, you "wave" by lifting two or three fingers of the left hand, without first removing that hand from the handlebar. When you're riding a crotch rocket, you lower the left hand to about ankle level, palm forward, and call that a wave. 
rec.motorcycles	 Santa Clara, and Sunnyvale I never came into any conflict with the local police over my lane splitting habits (all three of these cities were listed earlier as being anti-splitting in one way or another). I can't say whether this was due to luck, police kindness, or there not actually being any ordinances against it in these cities, so I continue..... 
rec.motorcycles	 My driveway and about half my neighbor's driveways are long enough to do a good 80 clicks (50mph for the velocity impaired) if we wanted to. Granted, I live in the country, however I've seen neighbors whip out of their driveways at the above mentioned 30 mph quite a bit- they claim they can tell that "There's noone on the road for quite a ways." This despite having nearly been hit myself by one of them while driving a Chev 4x4, and twice taking my 10-speed bicycle over the hood of a car that had pulled out, saw me, *then* stopped. Same driver. Same car. About two months apart. 
rec.motorcycles	 Sell the bike and the car and start taking the bus. That way you can keep drinking which seems to be where your priorities lay. 
rec.motorcycles	 Not too hard to remember, I bought a GS1000 new in '78. :-) It was 3rd place in the '78 speed wars (behind the CBX & XS Eleven) with a 11.8 @ 113 1/4 mile, and 75 horses. That wouldn't even make a good 600 these days. Then again, I paid $2800 for it, so technology isn't the only thing that's changed. Of course I'd still rather ride the old GS across three states than any of the 600's. 
rec.motorcycles	 On a completely different tack, what was the eventual outcome of Babe vs. the Bad-Mouthed Biker? 
rec.motorcycles	 Hey! I wasn't picking on Morgan. They use old technology. That's all I said. There's nothing wrong with using old technology. People still use shovels to dig holes even though there are lots of new powered implements to dig holes with. 
rec.motorcycles	 if I remember right, I heard that in the last election, only 18% of the members actually cast votes. I wonder if the current board and their friends and relatives make up 18% of the membership :-) :-) I certainly plan on staying with the club long enough to vote and to see the results. 
rec.motorcycles	 I admit it was a surprise to find something interesting to read in the most boring and worthless mag of all the ones I get. 
rec.motorcycles	 I spoke to a sales dweeb in 3X, a Ducati dealer here in Blighty, and he had nothing good to say about them... it appears they are waaaay underpowered, (basically, it's the 750/900 with a 400cc engine), and there have been some quality problems (rusty _frame_ !!). Save your pennies... buy the 900 :) 
rec.motorcycles	 I first heard it about academic politics but the same thought seems to apply to the BMWMOA 
rec.motorcycles	 mjsSecondly, it is the adhesion of the mjstyre on the road, the suspension geometry and the ground clearance of the mjs motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles, and mjsnot the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears. Are you seriously 
rec.motorcycles	 I may not wave: I just wink at you with one eye. 'Course, it's hard to see that through a shield and sunglasses, but hey, if you're a "true rider with the real riding attitude," you'll sense it. 
rec.motorcycles	 This tactic depends for its effectiveness on the dog's conformance to a "psychological norm" that may not actually apply to a particular dog. I've tried it with some success before, but it won't work on a Charlie Manson dog or one that's really, *really* stupid. A large Irish Setter taught me this in *my* yard (apparently HIS territory) one day. I'm sure he was playing a game with me. The game was probably "Kill the VERY ANGRY Neighbor" Before He Can Dispense the TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.

rec.motorcycles	 Hi. I have been thinking about buying a Motorcycle or a while now and I have some questions: 
rec.motorcycles	 I remember a commercial for some cheap, top- heavy import cage a while back, where the driver says while wearing a stuck-up fake TV anouncers smile: 
rec.motorcycles	 One word "HEAVY". It steers heavy, turns require alot of effort. Hard to get access to the large V-4 motor. Weak/small front forks with anti-dive gizmos! 
rec.motorcycles	 I've recently become father of twins! I don't think I can afford to keep 2 bikes and 2 babies. Both babies are staying, so 1 of the Harleys is going. 
rec.motorcycles	 For those of you with motorcycles of the liquid-cooled persuasion, what brand of coolant do you use and why? I am looking for aluminum-safe coolant, preferably phosphate-free, and preferably cheaper than $13/gallon. (Can you believe it: the Kaw dealer wants $4.95 a QUART for the Official Blessed Holy Kawasaki Coolant!!! No way I'm paying that usury...)

rec.motorcycles	 Hell, just save your candle stubs and bring them. Light them up, and dribble the wax all over the kindling wood and light _that_. Although I like the belly-button lint / eggshell case idea the best, if you're feeling particularly industrious some eventful evening. Or you can do what I did one soggy summer: open the fuel line, drain some onto a piece of rough or rotten wood, stick that into the middle of the soon-to- be inferno and CAREFULLY strike a match... As Kurt Vonnegut titled one of the latter chapters in Cat's Cradle, "Ah-Whoom!" 
rec.motorcycles	 YESSS! You make me proud to' "be an 'Merkun. Good thing you didn't get shot though. Don't" "try that with a good'ole boy in Texas. I once had a jeep driver south of Conroe cut me off (I was in my car) after I had flipped him off for doing something really idiotic and senseless. All 280 lbs of him stretches out of his jeep; he walks back (he is blocking all traffic between Dallas and Houston since the freeway has been squeezed into a single lane) and says to me, "Stick that finger out again and I'll rip it off your hand and shove it down your sorry-ass throat." I stared straight ahead, unblinking. A hundred cars were honking. Eventually he got back into his jeep, face beet-red with anger, and all the rest of the way back to Houston I tailed him, waving, honking, flipping him off, yelling... I'm glad he decided not to shoot me. /-----b-o-d-y---i-s---t-h-e---b-i-k-e---------------------------- 
rec.motorcycles	 Not only that, but this morning I saw a TV ad for a waterski bike (a Sea Doo, for those who care). I watched the lengthy ad very carefully, and in every case and at every speed the riders turned the handlebars left to go left, and right to go right. In other words, they were *NOT* countersteering. 
rec.motorcycles	 Anyone in Europe got any advice for a US citizen whose going to be living and working in Italy for a year and wants to buy a motorcycle there? An Italian friend just arrived here in Washington State to work for two years, and she's finding it very very difficult to obtain car insurance. So I thought I'd ask... 
rec.motorcycles	 McGuire's makes a plastic scratch/removing compound and a plastic polishing compound which really work great as well. 
rec.motorcycles	 Can someone recommend how to ship a motorcycle from San Francisco to Seattle? And how much might it cost? 
rec.motorcycles	 I'll throw in a vote for a Metzler "economy" tire, the ME77. Good for mid-size older bikes. Rated to 130mph. Wearing well and handles my 12 mile ride(twisties) to work well on the SR500. Costs a bit more than the Chengs/IRC's etc, but still less than the Sport Metzlers for the newer bikes. Cost from Chaparral is about $60 for the front, and $70 for the rear. 
rec.motorcycles	 I have had this happen to me often enough that I always look for it. On my ride to work in the morning I come to a stop light where there are 3 lanes in my direction. One for left turns, one for straight through, and one for right turns. All clearly marked. Plus there is a clearly marked bicycle lane. I ride into the right turn lane with my signal on and stop at the stop line. Looking left to see if I can make a "right turn on red" and when I start to move discovered that some idiot has pulled into the bike lane and is trying to pass me on the right. GRRR. I always do a head check on bike lanes. Not always for bicycles. . . 
rec.motorcycles	 As a new BMW owner I was thinking about signing up for the MOA, but right now it is beginning to look suspiciously like throwing money down a rathole. When you guys sort this out let me know. 
rec.motorcycles	 Prestone. I buy it at ShopKo for less than that a _gallon_. BMW has even more expensive stuff than Kawasaki (must be from grapes only grown in certain parts of the fatherland), but BMW Dave* said "Don't worry about it -- just change it yearly and keep it topped off". It's been keeping Gretchen happy since '87, so I guess it's OK. 
rec.motorcycles	 If a large Malmute counts then yes someone has heard(and seen) such an irresponsible childish stunt. The dog needed assistance straightening out once on board. The owner would lift the front legs of dog and throw them over the driver/pilots shoulders. Said dog would get shit eating grin on its face and away they'd go. The dogs ass was firmly planted on the seat. 
rec.motorcycles	 The Yammie Deltabox and the Hawk frame are conceptually similar but Yammie has a TM on the name. The Hawk is a purer 'twin spar' frame design: investment castings at steering head and swing arm tied together with aluminum extruded beams. The Yammie solution is a bit more complex. 
rec.motorcycles	 Since most legislators are lawyers it is very difficult to get any law passed that would cut down on lawyers' business. That is why "No-fault" insurance laws always backfire. 
rec.motorcycles	 Zero to very fast very quickly... lastest rumor is 115 hp at the rear wheel, handles like a dream in a straight line to 80-100, and then gets a tad upset according to a review in Cycle World... cornering, er well, you can't have everything... Seriously, handling is probably as good as the big standards of the early 80's but not compareable to whats state of the art these days. 
rec.motorcycles	 Absolutely, unless you are in the U.S. Then the cager will pull a gun and blow you away. 
rec.motorcycles	 Yup. Unfortunately, as has been pointed out, the cost of insurance does NOT go down with No Fault. The crappiest drivers make out like bandits because they no longer have to bear the responsibility of paying for insurance that they have boosted in price for themselves by being crappy drivers. The good drivers now pay through the nose to spread the cost of the crappy drivers' actions, and that's not fair. 
rec.motorcycles	 Maybe...then again did you get rid of that H/D of yorn and buy a rice rocket of your own? That would certainly explain the friendliness...unless you maybe had a piece of toilet paper stuck on the bottom of your boot...8-). 
rec.motorcycles	 Continuously, on this forum, and on the street, you find quite a difference between the opinions of what motorcycling is to different individuals. Cruiser-bike riders have a different view of motorcycling than those of sport bike riders (what they like and dislike about motorcycling). This is not closed-minded. To NOT RECOGNIZE this, is in effect, close-minded. 
rec.motorcycles	 Yes, yes, yes. Motorcycling is slightly different to each and every one of us. This is the nature of people, and one of the beauties of the sport. 
rec.motorcycles	 I don't think this is the case, at least not on all jetskis. On my friend's jetski, bars turn left to go left. Anyway, all you're doing there is changing the yaw of the jets, so the relationship between the handlbars and the rear-mounted jets is completely arbitrary (simple linkage could make it work either way). 
rec.motorcycles	 I can see the liability of putting stickers on the car while it was moving, or something, but it's the BDI that chooses to start and then drive the car in a known unsafe condition that would (seem to be) liable. Furthermore, they would have had the last chance to avoid an unsafe situation, which is an additional factor in attributing "blame". 
rec.motorcycles	 Well, I would guess the probability of a BMW driver having a gun would be lower than some other vehicles. At least, I would be more likely to say something to someone in a luxosedan, than a hopped-up pickup truck, for example. 
rec.motorcycles	 So does clear lipstick/chapstick/etc. fit under the "natural look" or the "waxy shit" category? I wear something on my lips to keep them from drying out. Kissing dry, cracked, parched lips isn't too fun either. 
rec.motorcycles	 I was very lucky I found a jacket I liked that actually _fits_. HG makes the v-pilot jackets, mine is a very similar style made by Just Leather in San Jose. I bought one of the last two they ever made. 
rec.motorcycles	 It works for me. I avoid obscenities, and try to remain calm cool and collected, and try something like, "You almost just killed me, and I'm not moving until you apologize." or something more or less benign like that. I haven't been shot a single time, but I don't do it in Texas, and I do only do it when there are plenty of witnesses around. 
rec.motorcycles	 Depends on in what context you want it commented on. It handles great compared to some bikes, not so good compared to others. What would you like it compared to? (Yes, I've put a few miles on one, although I've never owned one). 
rec.motorcycles	 Well, you can accomplish both goals, actually, if you have a definite physical type in mind when you go to these (cough) church meetings.. If your tastes tend to smaller, more petite (cough) churchgoers, it is more likely that they will have a smaller head, and you can safely get a medium or small helmet. 
rec.motorcycles	 Bzzzt. The 750SS is 40 pounds lighter than the 900SS. I personally, and recently, witnessed my 750SS do a stoppie with a larger-than- average rider aboard. He said it took two fingers on that measely single front disk to accomplish the task. How much more brake do you need? 
rec.motorcycles	 Ahh, and just how were the carbs rejeted to "match" the changes you made to the bike? A stage three kit from K/N or Dynojet? 
rec.motorcycles	 That plastic bodywork is useless. That torque, and an upright riding position is better than a slightly or radically forward riding position combined with a high-rpm low torque motor. 
rec.motorcycles	 hints on what will keep the organization in business that long. (And preferably longer, of course, and worth being part of.)

rec.motorcycles	 I'd recommend that you hop on the back of it and cruise - that's a really nice ride, if you choose your route with any care at all. Shouldn't cost more than about $30 in gas, and maybe a night's motel bill... 
rec.motorcycles	 I think you have to go a little further back. This opinion comes from riding CB750's GS1000's KZ1300's and a V-Max. I find no enjoyment in riding a V-Max fast on a twisty road. 
rec.motorcycles	 No... you can do this? Really? The other morning I went to do a lane change on the freeway and looked in my mirror, theer was a car there, but far enough behind. I looked again about 3-5 seconds later, car still in same position, i.e. not accelerating. I triple check with a head turn and decide I have plenty of room, so I do it, accelerating. I travel about 1/4 mile staying ~200 feet off teh bumper of the car ahead, and I do a casual mirror check. This guy is RIGHT on my tail, I mean you couldn't stick a hair between my tire & his fender. I keep looking in the mirror at him a,d slowly let off teh throttle. He stays there until I had lost about 15mph and then comes around me and cuts me off big time. I follow him for about 10 miles and finally get bored and turn back into work. 
rec.motorcycles	 Yes! Up the coast, over to Portland, then up I-5. Really nice most of the way, and I'm sure there's even better ways. 
rec.motorcycles	 dam9543 tI get back drom work today, look at me bike before dam9543 proceding in-side. I nearly shit, my new DRY RIDER cover is dam9543 gone! Barely two weeks old, and already gone, GOD-AM 
rec.motorcycles	 Do any Honda gurus know if I can replace the the front sprocket on my 1979 Honda CB750K with a slightly larger one? (I see this as being preferable to reducing the size of the rear one) 
rec.motorcycles	 Oh boy, a little K-bike versus /2 scuffling? Grow up! And that goes for the both of you! 
rec.motorcycles	 A Sea Doo is a boat. It turns by changing the angle of the duct behind the propeller. A waterski bike looks like a motorcycle but has a ski where each wheel should be. Its handlebars are connected through a familiar looking steering head to the front ski. It handles like a motorcycle. 
rec.motorcycles	 Agreed, but, yes, chapstick fits under the "waxy shit" category, although I've noticed that stealing Annette's chapstick (after she's applied it :-) kept my lips from cracking this past winter like they have in all previous winters. Sigh...the price I must pay... 
rec.motorcycles	 I shipped my K75S from Portland Oregon to Daytona for this years bike week (I rode it back!). The company I used is The Federal Co's. You can reach them at 1-800-747-4100 ex 214. You either have to be a AMA member, or maybe it is just a discount for AMA, not sure. (Call 1-800-AMA-JOIN to become an AMA member) 
rec.motorcycles	 Greg's obviously confused. There aren't many (any) gentlemen on this newsgroup. Well, maybe. One or two. 
rec.motorcycles	 Stick an ME33 on the front. I've got a Laser on the front of my GPz, and it has been a fantastic tire. Best front tire I've ever had. 
rec.motorcycles	 Er, without a bike (Ed, maybe you ought to respond to this...), how you gonna get there? 
rec.motorcycles	 Denmark, eh? Should have taken a short sword and cleaved his car in half. Since I assume you didn't have a short sword on you, I certainly have no problems with your choice of substitute action. 
rec.motorcycles	 I must have missed the article on the Spagthorpe Viking. Was that the one with the little illuminated Dragon's Head on the front fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers? 
rec.motorcycles	 I'll second that. In addition, I find my hazards to be more often used than my horn. At speeds below 40mph on the interstates, quite common in mountains with trucks, some states require flashers. In rural areas, flashers let the guy behind you know there is a tractor with a rather large implement behind it in the way. Use them whenever you need to communicate that things will deviate from the norm. 
rec.motorcycles	 The V-max goes in a strait line like shit shrough a goose. In the corners, I'd rather ride a Honda 305 Dream. 
rec.motorcycles	 So it looks like I'm going to have to put a couple of bikes in storage for a few months, starting several months from now, and I'm already contemplating how to do it so they're as easy to get going again as possible. I have everything under control, I think, besides the batteries. I know that if I buy a $50.00 Battery Tender for each one and leave them plugged in the whole time the bikes are in storage, they'll be fine. But I'm not sure that's necessary. I've never heard anyone discussing this idea, so maybe there's some reason why it isn't so great. But maybe someone can tell me. 
rec.motorcycles	 Yes. Unfortunately, there is also the concept that the owner of a car is not responsible for the actions of any (authorized) user of the car. That's one of the biggest arguments against photo-radar ticketing systems. 
rec.motorcycles	 I've seen solar battery boosters, and they seem to come without any guarantee. On the other hand, I've heard that some people use them with success, although I have yet to communicate directly with such a person. Have you tried one? What was your experience? How did you use it (occasional charging, long-term leave-it-for-weeks, etc.)? 
rec.motorcycles	 Tod, I think you've misspoke. If they're banking on owning a motorcycle to get them laid, then I doubt they have sexual fortunes. Quite the reverse... 
rec.motorcycles	 Only if you have a weeny insurance company. Unless it's some stupid PA law. I know that if some jerk hits me while I'm in a parking lot, if my insruance company doesn't sue his (or his doesn't immediately say, 'Yes, it's his fault') I'll sure him myself and tell my insurance company to go to hell if they raise my rates. 
rec.motorcycles	 Yeah, make darn sure you cover all the glass, so the driver can't reasonably expect to be able to drive with the things on the car. 
rec.motorcycles	 I moved to Sweden and I have to take all the tests again (written and road) even though I had a valid US license for 12 some years... Of course I became a resident, and could drive on my US license until I became resident. Don't know about Italy, it's different in the EEC. 
rec.motorcycles	 On my LC (RZ to any ex-colonists) I replaced the bolt at the bottom of the barrel with a tap. When I wanted a coffee I could just rev the engine until boiling and pour out a cup of hot water. I used ethylene glycol as antifreeze rather than methanol as it tastes sweeter. 
rec.motorcycles	 I would be scared of trying to fit the one piece. When I got my two piece, I got the jacket in 42 and the pants in 40 (just due to my manly-man of an athletic build, kind of thing) No laughing, please. Seriously, I'm not trim and the 42 pants would have been way too big. Also, I don't think the 1 piece does provide better protection. If I'm wrong, I'll be swiftly if ever so gently correct by the net.pansies.of.knowledge (as they like to call themselves). 
rec.motorcycles	 I generally find that after two or three decent hits of nitrous, my riding improves enormously. Drinking is silly, your breath smells, it costs lots of money and the pigs can detect it with their machines. NO2 works for me, try it. 
rec.motorcycles	 It's normal for the BMW K bikes to use a little oil in the first few thousand miles. I don't know why. I've had three new K bikes, and all three used a bit of oil when new - max maybe .4 quart in first 1000 miles; this soon quits and by the time I had 10,000 miles on them the oil consumption was about zero. I've been told that the harder you run the bike (within reason) the sooner it stops using any oil. 
rec.motorcycles	 I too, usually wear sunglasses inside my full face helmet to keep dirt & wind out of my contacts. Mumble, mumble, mumble ... 
rec.motorcycles	 What's the problem here? Back in 1958 I rode a Puch 175 from Paris to Barcelona and back. That was a two stroke, and back then it was representative of the size of bikes on the road. A 350 was considered a big bike, and the superbikes of the day were 500cc or 600cc. Anything bigger was real rare.

rec.motorcycles	 It depends on the bike. Once you've found a bike you're interested in, call some insurance companies for rates. Some bikes are much cheaper to insure than you might think (my EX-500 only costs me $127/year in St. Louis; I'm 27)

rec.motorcycles	 Honda: a "V" designates a V engine street bike. "VF" for V-4, "VT" for V-twin. "CB" is a street bike with an parallel twin or inline 4-cylinder engine.

"CL" was for the old steet scramblers-street bikes with high pipes "CM" was a "custom" street bike "CR" is dirt only two strokes "XL" is dual purpose bike "XR" was dirt only four stroke, but now can be a dual purpose bike if it has an "L" as a suffix. "GL" is a touring bike 
rec.motorcycles	 This is not good advice. A couple of years I was involved in a low-speed getoff in which I landed on my back on the pavement. My head (helmeted) hit the pavement with a "clunk", leaving a couple of dings and chips in the paint at the point of impact, but no other visible damage. I called the helmet manufacturer and inquired about damage. They said that the way a fiberglass shell works is to first give, then delaminate, then crack. This is the way fiberglass serves to spread the force of the impact over a wider area. After the fiberglass has done its thing, the crushable foam liner takes care of absorbing (hopefully) the remaining impact force. They told me that the second stage of fiberglass functionality (delamination of the glass/resin layers) can occur with NO visible signs, either inside or outside of the helmet. They suggested that I send them the helmet and they would inspect it (including X-raying). I did so. They sent back the helmet with a letter stating that that they could find no damage that would compromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection. (I suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claim prior damage to the helmet in the event I were to sue them.) 
rec.motorcycles	 it seems the 200 miles of trailering in the rain has rusted my bike's headers. the metal underneath is solid, but i need to sand off the rust coating and repaint the pipes black. any recommendations for paint and application of said paint? 
rec.motorcycles	 Can somebody tell me what all the letter spesifications on motorcycle models really mean. Example: What means the C, the B and the R in Honda CBR. - Or the V, S, G, L and P in Suzuki VS750GLP 
rec.motorcycles	 Several years ago, while driving a cage, a dog darted out at a quiet intersection right in front of me but there was enough distance between us so I didn't have to slow down. However, a 2nd dog suddenly appeared and collided with my right front bumper and the force of the impact was enough to kill that Scottish Terrier. 
rec.motorcycles	 Help! I've got a friend shopping for her first motorcycle. This is great! Unfortunately, she needs at most a 28" seat. This is not great. So far, the only thing we've found was an old and unhappy-looking KZ440. 
rec.motorcycles	 From article <C5quw0.Btq@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu, by mikeh@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu (Mike Hollyman): Hi, I have an 82 CB750 Custom that I just replaced the cylinder head gasket on. Now when I put it back together again, it wouldn't idle at all. It was only running on 2-3 cylinders and it would backfire and spit flames out the exhaust on the right side. The exhaust is 4-2 MAC. I bought new plugs today and it runs very rough and still won't idle. I am quite sure the fine tune knobs on the carbs are messed up. I checked the timing, it was fine, so I advanced it a little and that didn't help.

rec.motorcycles	 Well, you really can't dig a hole with a stock Shovel; you at least need some performance mods like stroking and cams. Besides, it's REAL bad on the rear tire. 
rec.motorcycles	 I think there is a legal clause in the RR name, regardless of who owns it it must be a British company/owner - i.e. BA can sell the company but not the name.

rec.motorcycles	 Seems to me that the driver was driving the vehicle visually impaired. Isn't that like not scraping ice and snow off your windshield and such? 
rec.motorcycles	 bound people! The rig consists of a flat-bed sidecar rig that the wheelchair can be clamped to. The car has a set of hand controls mounted on conventional handlebars! Looks wierd as hell to see this legless guy driving the rig from the car while his girlfriend sits on the bike as a passenger! 
rec.motorcycles	 While I agree with you on that formal training is essential for safe riding, I disagree strongly with your original point. The point of formal training must be to prepare riders for the road. Preparedness is in my opinion to know as much as possible. So, to exclude some aspects of riding a bike in a course is wrong IMHO. Now to countersteering in particular. Countersteering is something that must be trained. A common reaction among new bikers (or bicycle riders) in an emergency situation, is to steer the motorcycle like a bicycle. As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the direction opposite to what was intended. Needless to say, this is dangerous. I have a specific example: A rider in a left turn. The rider thinks he/she is to close to the right shoulder of the road, and tries to steer the motorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right handle. The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road. A worse scenario: The same rider, same turn. In the middle of the turn the rider sees a truck coming towards him/her. The panicking rider tries to steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it. 
rec.motorcycles	 I had a kz440 and thought it was the best $100 bike I've ever ridden. And mind you, I've ridden many bikes.

rec.motorcycles	 So how do I steer when my hands aren't on the bars? (Open Budweiser in left hand, Camel cigarette in the right, no feet allowed.) If I lean, and the bike turns, am I countersteering? Is countersteering like benchracing only with a taller seat, so your feet aren't on the floor? 
rec.motorcycles	 Been a while since you hit the PIP? The pavement (at least until around exit 9) is for sh*t these days. I think it must have taken a beating this winter, because I don't remember it being this bad. It's all breaking apart, and there are some serious potholes now. Of course there are also the storm drains that are *in* your lane as opposed to on the side of the road (talk about annoying cost saving measures). 
rec.motorcycles	 I'd bet the price of the helmet that it's okay...From 6 feet or higher, maybe not. 
rec.motorcycles	 Some will, and others will steer with their tuchuses. I don't know how much the teaching of countersteering in the beginner course really helps the tuchus steerers. I was one, I guess that I always steered a bicycle that way, and I only got the hang of countersteering in normal riding *after* the course. I could do the countersteering swerves in the course no problem, but I only started using it in my normal riding when I decided that my turning at speed (off-ramps and the like) was a lot more difficult that it should have been. I knew how it works (although that's currently up for debate) definitely knew *that* it works, as I could do it in swerves, but only figured it out later in my normal riding. Just a data point. I think that it's not a bad idea to bring the idea up, but it's best to let everyone tuchus-steer for the first lesson or two, so they can learn to shift gears before they have to worry about proper handlebar technique. 
rec.motorcycles	 When your helmetted nogin hits an immoveabe object, there are only four things to dissipate the energy: the immoveable object, the helmet shell, the helmet liner, the rider's head, the rider's ego (ok, five). Assuming that the helmet/ head assembly takes the same impact, if the shell cracks in one case, then in the other the liner must be dented, or the head gets jiggled. If it's the the liner that's dented, the helmet is just as toast as if the shell were cracked, it won't absorb energy form an impact in that area. If it's the head that's getting jiggled, maybe the new gear isn't of as high quality after all? 
rec.motorcycles	 It's exactly as dangerous as it looks. You're hard to see and have little protection. Keeping out of trouble means knowing your limits, keeping your machine in good shape and being able to predict and make up for every stupid move that drivers make out there. We deal with it because it's fun, but staying alive takes a conscious effort. 
rec.motorcycles	 Look, guy, I doubt anyone here approves of Drunk Driving, but if he's been caught and convicted and punished maybe you ought to lighten up? I mean, it isn't like most of us haven't had a few and then ridden or driven home. *We* just didn't get caught. And I can speak for myself and say it will *never* happen again, but that is beside the point. 
rec.motorcycles	 Sure you can do wheelies with a shaft drive bike. I had a BMW R100RS that was a wheelie monster! Of course it didn't have the initial power burst to just twist it into the air - I had to pop the clutch. I also had to replace front fork seals a few times as well. The fairing is a bit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all the time. But let me give you fair warning: I trashed the ring/pinion gear in the final drive of my K75 (I assume) doing wheelies. And this was NO cheap fix either!! There is some kind of "slip" device in the shaft to prevent IT from breaking. Unfortunately, it didn't save the gears! 
rec.motorcycles	 Well, simply put, drinking is irrelavent. Driving drunk is indefensable and unforgivable. There is a large differnece.

We'll be riding some twisty, fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans). 
rec.motorcycles	 I am in hte market for a new bike (been without for a few years). The two main bikes I'm looking at seriously are The Yamaha Virago 535 and the Honda Shadow VLX 583. I am leaning towards the Yamaha for its shaft drive, the Honda is Chain. Insurance in Fla. is more costly than I thought, so I am staying in this power range. Thanks in advance for any opinions and or experiences 
rec.motorcycles	 Hey, man, you brought it up. I agree completely, driving drunk is really stupid, and I understand and appreciate that you feel bad about it. But DWI is endemic in our society. It is a REAL problem. And we, as motorcyclists, can be in the worst of vulnerable positions around a drunk driver. (Alert readers might remember that last year I witnessed a DWI accident (right bloody in front of me), and was unable to save the life of one of the participants, as I reported here.) Also, drunk driving by motorcyclists is a prime cause of their injury and death, which raises the insurance rates, forces stupidly restrictive laws, and turns the public against those of us who ride responsibly. 
rec.motorcycles	 On my 59 sporty I had some pinhole leaks open up on the back seam. I kreme it about a year ago and have had no problems at all. Be real careful as the cleaning part of the solution is hell on paint. -Jim

rec.motorcycles	 Well, it's been fun. This is my last day at Bellcore and It will be a while before I have net access again (taking time off and scheduling Military Schools for the summer on joint operations, and anything else that looks good). I have had a blast reading, responding and commenting on things posted here. My final say is 9mm's are inferior to .45's errr oh wrong news group. Hopefully I'll be back. I guess "internet withdrawl" starts around 1pm or so and considering I never knew inet existed 2 years ago I am really going to miss it. 
rec.motorcycles	 An effort was made to remove the sticker. It came to pieces, leaving most of it firmly attached to the window. It was dark, and around 10:00 pm. The sticker (before being mangled in an ineffective attempt to be torn off) warned the car would be towed if not removed. A "reasonable person" would arguably have driven the car. Had an accident occured, I don't think my friend's attorney would have much trouble fixing blame on the apartment mangement. 
rec.motorcycles	 A traffic citation is an accusation of having committed a crime. That's why they have to go through the motions of having a trial if you want one, you are still innocent until proven guilty. Cops are not the only ones who can accuse people of committing crimes, anyone who witnesses a crime can do so. 
rec.motorcycles	 Is anyone going to the P.B frenzy at Cadwell park in May. I am going, but only to watch. 
rec.motorcycles	 If we do, I think you'd loose. Sure, you're hand's already on the throttle. And your thumb is already near the horn button. Pushing the horn button is one simple move. Revving the throttle requires either engaging the clutch, or accelerating. The first is a more complex manuver than a simple horn button push, and the second ain't too bright when there is a potential hazard ahead. Besides, the unique sound of a horn is more effective in attracting the attention of BDI cagers than is the sound of an engine, which is what they expect to hear (you are on the road!). 
rec.motorcycles	 One day out riding, my friend and i were passing a field of goats and noticed 2 out on the road. As we slowed to pass the ram made a dash at my friend just missing him and then tangling it self up in the barb wire fence. Being good samaritains and generally nice guys we turned around to untrangle the goat from the barbed wire. As I pulled up next to him (seeing him still tangled up), stopped the bike and got off the Goat had vanished (into the field I guess).

rec.motorcycles	 If he's not, I will. Put two riders on identical machines. It's the one who knows what he's doing, and why, that will be faster. It *may* be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is, through trial and error, but it is not very effective methodology. Only by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one improve on that technique (I hold that this applies to any human endeavor). 
rec.motorcycles	 THe original battery in an 8-10 year old BMW may be fine. Mine lasted many years. The replacement 30AH battery from BMW was a disaster. The mechanic from Comp. Acc. told me that CA would warantee replace the bad one with a new one of the same evil bad batteries and tell the customer if they have problems to bring it back and they'd do it again. It seems that many of those 30AH batteries were DOA, near-DOA, and always unlikely to be going strong by the end of the warantee period on them. THere was a big batch of bad ones, and they replaced them with -you guessed it - more bad ones. BMW switched to a 25AH battery that has more cold cranking amps, even if it has less total juice. 
rec.motorcycles	 Now the bike is off warranty, I finally replaced the stock items on my Softail Custom with the title ones. Installation was pretty easy in both cases, even for a fairly non-mechanical chemist type dude like me! I discovered the limitations of my tool collection, but had fun buying and making the requisite tools!

rec.motorcycles	 Tough question -- more dangerous than driving a car, and far more dangerous if you don't apply a modicum of intelligence to the activity. Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot faster on a motorcycle than in a car. But with care, it is not unreasonably dangerous. Also, buying good protective clothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong, you are likely to be less severely injured.

rec.motorcycles	 Sixteen days I had put off test driving the Honda ST1100. Finally, the 17th was a Saturday without much rain. In fact it cleared up, became warm and sunny, and the wind died. About three weeks ago, I took a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride. They had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours before I arrived. And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom -- surrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.

rec.motorcycles	 There's an article in Motorcycling a couple of months back specifically on women's attire for serious and not-so-serious riding.

rec.motorcycles	 You and the Beav should lighten up (esp the Beav). I agree that DUI/DWI is serious. We should have reasonable laws, strict enforcement, and tough sentences. But, Andrew did not post "looking for sympathy over the consequences." He posted asking for advice because he had an extremely high quote. His post was obviously valid because he later found insurance for LESS. He noted why he was in his predicament but did not defend in any way drunk driving (and has renounced drunk driving). There are too many repeat offenders to worry about and other BDC. Why try to make this person who is no longer part of the problem an outcast? He has paid his debt to society. Step off the high horse. We have all been irresponsible in the past.

rec.motorcycles	 I've got a Belstaff tankbag on my FJ1100, and it ain't too good. It's difficult to fix it securely cos of the the tank/fairing/sidepanel layout, and also with the bars on full lock the bag touches the handlebar switches, so you get the horn on full left lock and the starter motor on full right!!

rec.motorcycles	 I'm thinking about becoming a bike owner this year w/o any bike experience thus far. I figure that getting a decent used bike for under $1K the thing would pay for itself while I'm at grad school (car permits are $$$ where I'm going and who want's to ride a bus). I'm looking for advice on a first bike - best models/years. I'm NOT looking for an old loud roaring thing that sounds like a monster. The quit whirring of newer engines is more to my liking. 
rec.motorcycles	 mjsWell, there are just as many courses here and elsewhere that do *not* mjsteach the technique, yet seem to be rather successful... 
rec.motorcycles	 being a mere female, I have often found I can't really take the big offensive line with asshole car drivers, so I found a more subtle and nastly ooops I mean nasty way to get back at them. If somebody cuts you up, just wait till they have pulled out past you, and then gently lean over and bend their aerial, every time I have done that it has eventually snapped off near the base - which tends to go undetected for a while and is a bummer to replace. 
rec.motorcycles	 mjsNo No No No!! All I am saying is that you don't even need to tell people mjsthe technique of countersteering, cos they will do it intuitively the first mjstime they try to go round a corner.

rec.motorcycles	 I agree with this 100%. After all, when you grab under his chin and are careful to keep your hands away from his twisting head, what is he going to do -- tailwag you to death? I even had one occasion where I was unexpectedly jumped by a 130 lb. German Shepherd and grabbed his upper jaw in one hand and his lower jaw in the other. Now I'm holding his mouth open (no way is he strong enough to clamp down) and he can do nothing. 
rec.motorcycles	 On the other side of the fence, I owned a Bieffe off-road helmet. Took what I would consider a minor fall, and had visible damage to the shell. Yes, the helmet did its job. But the damage/impact ratio was scary. I own Bell Moto-5 now, have taken impacts on order of twice the Bieffe impact (we do this frequently in MX), and don't even have a scratch on it after two seasons. My recommendation is to buy _high_ quality gear. YMMV.

rec.motorcycles	 Sure you can have everything, if by "everything" you mean fast straight line performance AND handling - present day liter sport bikes have more horsepower and have faster 0-60 and 1/4 mile times than the V-max... Plus, they corner just a bit better... 
rec.motorcycles	 I have a cheap solar charger that I keep in my car. I purchased it via some mail order catalog when the 4 year old battery in my Oldsmobile would run down during Summer when I was riding my bike more than driving my car. Knowing I'd be selling the car in a year or so, I purchased the charger. Believe it or not, the thing worked. The battery held a charge and energetically started the car, many times after 4 or 5 weeks of just sitting. 
rec.motorcycles	 Hmmm.. The LDDC security guards over here in Docklands only place parking stickers on the drivers SIDE windows.. But on reflection that could still cause an accident.. Suppose it's because people aren't as litigious over here as in the states :-) 
rec.motorcycles	 I learned when riding bareback as a kid to "palm-reign", by just pushing on the right side of the horse's neck with your right palm to turn left - a lot like countersteering. So that came pretty easy to me in the transition to motorcycles. It took a while however to break my habit of kicking the rear fender with my heels to go faster. 
rec.motorcycles	 That's a twin-cam, right? There's a steel guard right next to the sprocket to keep a broken chain from punching a hole in the engine cases, and it's needed. There's probably not enough room to fit a bigger sprocket.

rec.motorcycles	 Well, I'd say you're mostly right, but for different reasons. (BTW, as of a couple years ago, the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750 GSX's and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is that most people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail- order types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily by law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep them honest about acquiring parts. 
rec.motorcycles	 While shopping for a passenger helmet, I noticed that in many cases the external dimensions of the helmets were the same from S through XL. The difference was the amount of inside padding.

rec.motorcycles	 There's also Billy Jack, The Wild One, Smokey and the Bandit (Where Jerry Reed runs his truck over Motorcycle Gangs Bikes), and a video tape documentary on the Hell's Angels I found in a rental store once 
rec.motorcycles	 I would agree entirely with these three paragraphs. But did the Hurt study make any distinction between an *ability* to swerve and a *failure* to swerve? In most of the accidents and near accidents that I've seen, riders will almost always stand on the brakes as hard as they dare, simply because the instinct to brake in the face of danger is so strong that it over-rides everything else. Hard braking and swerving tend to be mutually exclusive manouvres - did Hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally preferable? 
rec.motorcycles	 I'll second that!! I saw a list somewhere of all the stuff that it was unwise to buy secondhand - stuff like parachutes, toilet paper, condoms and motorcycle helmets... 
rec.motorcycles	 I thought that all coolants were aluminum safe any more. But I would like to know more since I must tear down my Kawasaki (again I must add). 
rec.motorcycles	 Me The understanding and ability to swerve was essentially absent among Me the accident-involved riders in the Hurt study.

rec.motorcycles	 My previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or something. I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target, then take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it didn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my house, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to the Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to the Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to harm.

Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi instead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run at is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.

rec.motorcycles	 Splitfires work mainly by providing a more-or-less unshrouded spark to the combustion chamber. If an engine's cylinder head design can benefit from this, then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase, most noticeably in lower rpm range torque. Splitfires didn't do diddly-squat for my 1992 GMC pickup (4.3l V6) but do give a noticeable performance boost in my 1991 Harley Sportster 1200 and my best friend's 1986 Sportster 883. Folks I know who've tried them in 1340 Evo motors can't tell any performance boost over plain plugs (which is interesting since the XLH and big twin EVO combustion chambers are pretty much the same shape, just different sizes). Two of my friends who have shovelhead Harleys swear by the splitfires but if I had a shovelhead, I'd dual-plug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plugs to make the machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense (plus they look really cool with a spark plug on each side of each head) 
rec.motorcycles	 Or perhaps it's referring to the wife and child sitting in the sidecar next to the one-up on the moto? 
rec.motorcycles	 Like most everyone else, I ended up getting two different sizes for the top and bottom. My top is a 46L and the bottom is a 48L. For the bottom, the waist is far too large, but the thighs fit just right (the 46 had a better waist, but cut off the circulation in my legs, I have large, muscular thighs, and no, I didn't use the thighmaster to get them :-). The jacket fits me ok in the chest, slightly snug at the waist, and too small in the arms. I can't imagine finding a one-piece size that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it's problems (strange, since my V-Pilot jacket fits great all over, and when I tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well). 
rec.motorcycles	 Yep...I think it's the only CB750 with a 630 chain. After 14 years, it's finally stretching into the "replace" zone. 
rec.motorcycles	 Ummm...did you have any bikes other than that KX80? If not, I'd suggest you look for an '89 ZX-7, since they only have about 90 horsepower, whereas the '90 has over 100 and might be a bit much for you... 
rec.motorcycles	 Dogs will chase anything that moves. I have two dogs and they love chasing me when I ride off. They will also chase any car that passes , running along the footpath/sidewalk at up to 60kph. They don't seem to go after trucks though, the size difference must be a factor.

You'd see a single red light come on and think, "Now, is he stopping but one brake-lamp is not working, or does he have those dumb bloody _red_ rear indicators?" This being Survival 101, you have to assume he's braking and take the appropriate actions, until such time as the light goes out and on again, after which you can be reasonably certain it's a bloody _red_ rear indicator. 
rec.sport.baseball	 The Orioles' pitching staff again is having a fine exhibition season. Four shutouts, low team ERA, (Well, I haven't gotten any baseball news since March 14 but anyways) Could they contend, yes. Could they win it all? Maybe. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I agree and disagree. John is saying that the batters efforts will result in 4 more wins then losses. While you are probably correct that 400% does not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something. I would rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in each of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning by .5% in each of 400 PAs. Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious positive association between John's statistic and winning games. Thus, before you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there is. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Hell, the Orioles' Opening Day game could easily be the largest in history if we had a stadium with 80,000 seats. But unfortunely the Yards (a definitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45,000 with 275 SRO spots. Ticket sales for the entire year is moving fast. Bleacher seats are almost gone for every game this year. It's a extremely likelyhood that the O's could sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for most of the year like '89). On another front, the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to be forced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently. Maybe we can get an owner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter. Fernando has made the O's as the fifth starter. The O's pitching staff looks pretty good. Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, and Fernando. Baltimore is my pick for the victors in a very competitive AL East. __________________________________________________________________________ |Admiral Steve C.

rec.sport.baseball	 There's a lot of whining about how much players are overpaid. I thought I'd put together an underpaid team that could win a pennant. I splurged and let four of the players earn as much as half a million dollars; the highest-paid player is Frank Thomas, at $900K. I cut some players, like Kenny Lofton, Chris Hoiles, Keith Mitchell, Tim Wakefield, and a bunch of pitchers, all of whom could have arguably made the team better at a cost of $1 million for the lot of them. The total team salary is $7,781,500, averaging slightly over $300K a player. If that's too steep, you can dump Thomas and Bagwell, replacing them with Paul Sorrento and a minimum wager to save a bit over a million dollars, and still have one of the best teams in the majors. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I doubt Henderson would clear waivers. And if he did, he would instantly be signed for the major league minimum, with Oakland picking up the remaining $3 million tab.

rec.sport.baseball	 Philadelphia at Chicago: Teams tied for 1st after Sunday Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four game series. One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader. "What could be better," declared Ernie Banks. Perhaps the fact that the Cubs are challenging? "It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked," announced Ryne Sandberg. "If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to win. "Lord, I hope we pull it off." The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete Rose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second. Kiki Cuyler cut the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third. Rose went to second on the play. Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to third. Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them. Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this year. Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a gap in right-center. "Cool Papa" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent Schmidt from scoring. Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone grounded out to second, ending the threat. "Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or Torrienti, and that is lowering their run total. It puts a lot of pressure on Klein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells Rose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to sustain their pace. The picthers have slumped at times." So came the analysis from Frank Chance. The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder moved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled home a run. In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it 3-1. Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein singled him to third. Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped out of the dugout to hit. Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs, Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense. He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third. Lance Parrish, hitting for Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered. Larry Bowa grounded into a 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter. Desiring a strikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick Trillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning. The Cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies. Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday. To get another righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock played third. Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen was worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against Lefty. Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving home four runs. Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added another, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings. The Phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more runs to ice an 11-7 triumph. Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off Robin Roberts. Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but the Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win. Bruce Sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the eighth. The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would conclude their series with the Expos on Monday.

He threw out a few baserunners, too. Ivan Rodriguez, *20* year old rookies: 88 games, .264/.276/.354. Didn't exactly suck behind the plate. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I wondered the same thing. When he first mentioned it, I thought he was just making a mistake but then he said it over and over. And then in the examples from other years, he gave stats for players from both leagues even when only one league expanded. 
rec.sport.baseball	 The O's just lost to the Rangers a few minutes ago I was not too happy about the pitching of Rick Sutcliffe (6 runs in 6 innings, 5 in the 3?) This puts me in remembering the 1990 O's season. After '89 we didn't do much over winter and we wound up in 5th. Now I know that Mussina, McDonald, and Rhodes are better pitching prospects than Ballard and Milacki but are any other Oriole fans scared out there? 
rec.sport.baseball	 wondering how he intends to use Howell. (Whatever happened to Senior Smoke?) 
rec.sport.baseball	 Well, maybe it will be. Banks is a 24 year-old prospect who "hasn't matured as quickly as they would have liked. Mahomes is a 22 year-old who is very highly touted. Tapani and Erickson are also young, and have looked very good this spring. The last spot was between Jim Deshaies, formerly of Houston and S.D. and Mike Trombley. Deshaies hasn't looked very good this spring, so I believe that the spot has gone to Trombley, although they hadn't wanted 3 starters this unproven. I personally believe very highly in Mahomes and Trombley.

rec.sport.baseball	 Well, it really isn't this cut and dry, but as a Jay fan the thing I feared worst has happened. The Yanks sent down Williams G and are going to start Williams B in CF. I also believe they kept Wickman and Millitello in their rotation, which is much nicer than that Kaminiecki and Mike Witt combo I thought they'd throw out their to the slaughterhouse because of their "experience". Granted, Witt "might" be good, but I think that they used rationale to keep the youngsters up and not given the job to Witt because he was a good pitcher and has experience. The Yanks are showing that they are taking positive strides forwards; the Jays with the loss of Dave Stewart are looking at gigantic holes in their pitching staff. The Orioles should also be there in the end.....

rec.sport.baseball	 The same Bill James? Why do you say that? It sounds like you're suggesting Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire; he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't all-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when everyone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy Campanella. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Could be. There is a Jayson Stark that writes weekly for some press syndicate and also for Baseball America. 
rec.sport.baseball	 That brings up an interesting point. Anyone else catch ESPN's piece about prospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of Fame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they were 24, and noticed some interesting things. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Bob, I think that Stark does this sort of thing as a joke, not as a serious prediction. I don't really see why we should shoot him for that. The guys who ought to be shot are the ones who keep claiming how great the Royals' chances are in the AL West, since all evidence indicates that they aren't joking and actually believe it. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Wow. ESPN can repeat eleven-year-old Bill James research. (Literally. Check the 1982 Abstract.) 
rec.sport.baseball	 Actually, I was simply relaying the reasoning of this so-called genius BW writer. I agree. The reasoning was foolish. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Usually one or two teams changes their logo or a minor uniform change per season, but the past few seasons have been incredible. Any thoughts on the new (old) Reds uniforms. I remember seeing a Pete Rose rookie card, and unless I miss my guess he was wearing the exact same duds. The Mets (HOW ABOUT DOC'S PERFORMANCE TODAY?!!!!!) have reinserted the Mets patch on the shoulder, and changed the Mets insgnia on the front of the jersey. To my knowledge it is the first time that has been changed since 1962, and it reminds me a little of the Dodger logo. Many teams have opted for a return to a previous style of uniform, or at least uniforms that look more traditional. (Phillies, Reds, Expos, White Sox, Padres, etc.) and the once bright colors have been altered to gray. The trend has also seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the early years, as opposed to the cookie-cutter saucer stadiums construcrted throughout the sixties. With salaries now reaching unbelievable highs, no one in the comissioner's office, and inter-league play on the horizon, it's nice to see that baseball at least looks like it was meant to be. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Does anyone have a list of Vegas odds for teams making the World Series? 
rec.sport.baseball	 I just wanted to let everyone know that I have lost what little respect I have for Jim LeFebvre after seeing today's Cubs game. First of all how could he start Maldonado over May. After the way May played at the end of last year and the way he tore up the Cactus League how could you let him sit the bench? Not to mention that a right hander (Maddux) started. I really blew my top when Lefebvre pinch hit for Rick Wilkins with TOMMY SHIELDS! How can you do that just because of the lefty-righty thing, too much is made of that. Wilkins is twice the hitter that Shields is. Then the next batter was Jose Vizcaino, one of the weakest hitters I have ever seen, and who had looked terrible at bat all day, and Lefebre let him hit, while May still sat the bench. I think even Arnie Harris was stunned by this because he showed May sitting in the dugout while Vizcaino was batting. Face it Lefebvre has got to be the worst manager in baseball. A dishard Cub fan 
rec.sport.baseball	 Sandberg is not particulary known for his stolen bases. What competition did Alomar have? Sandberg came in a year after Ripken, and the same year as Boggs, Gwynn, and the other magicians. So less attention was given to Sandberg. Alomar is the only one in his class to be worth a mediocre. Besides the numbers don't count. National league pitchers are much better pitchers. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Hey, he's the only manager so far to lead the Seattle Mariners to a winning season, out of, what, fifteen? Give him some credit for that. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Geez. Everyone comes up with Clark, Williams, Thompson. These guys were all up in 1987. That's ancient history. So in the last 6 years, noone, right? Beck doesn't count. I said 2 solid years. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Y'all lighten up on Harry, Skip'll be like that in a couple of years!! It comes out like "gahlah rrrraggggah". And don't forget his frequent references to the great SF Giant star Bobby Bonds! 
rec.sport.baseball	 Is there any doubt that this is true? After a few down years, the A.L. East is back to where it was in the early eighties. With the emergence of the O's and the Yanks, it is far and away the best. While the N.L. West has the best team in baseball, and the Reds aren't bad either, they have nothing else. The Giants, Astros, and Padres all have talent, they do not have the all arounf teams that are found in the A.L. East. And the Dodgers just plain suck. As for the Rockies, who knows? The A.L. East has the defending champs, and although they lost a lot to free agency, Toronto is still one of the best in baseball. The Orioles have the preseason favorite to win the Cy Young in Mike Mussina, and you can never forget about Ripken. The signings of Harold Baines and Harold Reynolds don't hurt to much either, although I always liked Bill Ripken. While they let a lot go this summer (Randy Milligan, Joe Orsulak, Bill Ripken, Bob Milacki, Sam Horn, Storm Davis, and Craig Lefferts), they kept the heart of their team intact. 
rec.sport.baseball	 ok - sorry about that...i didn't realise he was being sarcastic about those sort of things. 
rec.sport.baseball	 The Phillies were picked to be in first. Someone replied that the people who picked them were the same people who picked the Mets last year. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Y'know, if current trends continue, the Florida Marlins will be the first expansion team to go 162-0 and outscore their opponents by 486 runs. 
rec.sport.baseball	 You're right: Thomas, Gonzalez, Sheffield, and Griffey don't even begin to compare with Ripken, Boggs, and Gwynn, so no wonder Alomar gets so much attention. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Only if you persist in believing that Peter Gammons is more knowledgable about baseball than the average mailbox. Okay, I'm overstating. Still, the man actually had the gall to say that one out of every six pitchers in the NL this year did not pitch in the majors last year. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I'm not quite sure how these numbers are generated. It appears that in a neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two home runs). Or do they? What is "equivalent average?" 
rec.sport.baseball	 Yes, Ivan Rodriguez, last year. Batted .260 and threw out 51% of the baserunners. Not too shabby for a rookie from AA. 20 years old last year. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I totally agree with each point you made. Jose Viscaino looked like a single A hitter up there. Who swings on 3-1 count with Maddux pitching and your teams down by a run, and you haven't touched the ball all day. I also think too much is made of that lefty-righty thing. Watching the Cubs games I get the feeling Steve Stone knows a lot more about what the Cubs should be doing than Lefebre does. Harry said it best when he stated after another terrible Vizcaino at bat-- we can't wait til Sandberg returns! 
rec.sport.baseball	 As far as I know, Toronto, Pittsburgh, and New York (NL) change their uniforms every year. Every other year (e.g., New York), it will say Mets in cursive, New York in cursive, or New York in all caps. Minor changes, but they do change them often. Last year, I think they had New York in all caps. Did Toronto have Blue Jays or Toronto last year? What about Pittsburgh? 
rec.sport.baseball	 Oh, this is an easy trivia question. The answer is "any Cub not named Sandberg or Grace." 
rec.sport.baseball	 Wasn't Hulett injured yesterday after being hit in the face with a ball while running bases? I heard something about him recieving stiches and a possible broken nose. Is he at the park? 
rec.sport.baseball	 The Dodgers after one inning of play have committed one error. At this rate they'll have 1,455 errors this season! 
rec.sport.baseball	 Actually, there can be any number of players on a side. You can have a 25-man roster, a 40-man roster, etc.... 
rec.sport.baseball	 Don't knock Vaughn for being a spring training .400 hitter but a .250 regular season hitter. Around 30 games played isn't an indication of how good any hitter is, and the quality of pitching is way down. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Has David Wells landed with a team yet? I'd think the Tigers with their anemic pitching would grab this guy pronto! 
rec.sport.baseball	 Not due to the accident -- he just got a (really) bad haircut. Now, if you meant due to his floating fastball, well... 
rec.sport.baseball	 dwarner@journalism.indiana.edu said: I only caught the tail end of this one on ESPN. Does anyone have a report? (Look at all that Teal!!!! BLEAH!!!!!!!!!) 
rec.sport.baseball	 It depends on which uniforms you are talking about. For the last couple of years I believe Toronto and Pittsburgh has used the same uniforms, or at least very similar. The home jerseys had the team nick name (Blue Jays or Pirates), but the road jerseys had the name of the city (Toronto or Pittsburgh). I believe this is the way most teams design their uniforms.

rec.sport.baseball	 Well, Maddux looked excellent as the Braves shutout the Cubs 1 - 0. Justice drove in the only run with an RBI single in the first. Get ready for him to have a monster year. He is now hitting the ball to the opposite field with a lot of power to go with his natural power to right field and his good batting eye. If he stays healthy which he should (his back is full strength this year) he should get over 100 RBI and close to 30 HR.

rec.sport.baseball	 It is my understanding that the Dead will sing the NA at the Giants home opener on Mon. 4/12. The Giants are opening today in St. Louis. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I believe we are down to two: the 15-day and the 60-day. (I don't remember a 30-day, but rather a 21-day. Anyways, it's gone now.) The period length is a minimum, not a maximum. You can keep a guy on the 15-day for as long as you want, IF he's still certified as injured. The player must be periodically re-evaluated to determine if he's still injured (thus you cannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not wish to expose to waivers). If you get someone qualified for the 60-day that reduces the frequency of re-evaluations. There is no longer, I believe, any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL. When there was, you often had to choose and juggle your injured players between the lists. --King "Sparky" Banaiantttt|"No taxes: No new taxes, kbanaian@pitzer.claremont.eduttt|no old taxes, we are taxed Dept. of Economics, Pitzer Collegett|enough." -- Rep.

rec.sport.baseball	 What about Thaaammy Thotha? I for one was really sorry to hear that the Cubs had sent Heathcliff Slocumb to the minors! :-) 
rec.sport.baseball	 Walt Weiss tripled just barely inside the right field line and into the corner, driving in Santiago and Conine. These were the first two RBIs. The third came later when Weiss was knocked in. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Um, surely you didn't intend to compare the '93 Reds with the 29 Philidelphia A's. The Yankees were finishing 2nd to a team that was as good as the 26-28 Yankees, while the Yankees had aged some from their peak years. Ruth and Gehrig couldn't play every position simultaneously.

I was a sometime member of the Rene Lachemann fan club at the Oakland Coliseum, and have a deep respect for the guy. He's a gem. And, of course, Walt Weiss gives that franchise class. But yeah... whoever designed those uniforms was guilty of a paucity of style and imagination. Ugghhh! 
rec.sport.baseball	 Your speculation that the two proven veterans will produce better than Lopez is also no more than speculation. It *does* make a difference whether the speculation is well-founded or not. 
rec.sport.baseball	 The regular season of the 1992-93 Davis Tabletop Baseball League has just come to an end. To help us with next year's league, I would appreciate it if you would take a couple of minutes and vote for our league MVP and CY winners. These awards, and players' standings in them, will inflate their salaries for next year's league. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Since I was the one responsible for these divergent threads of approx. 40+ posts (going back to: The Braves could be better off if an injury happens), I may as well inject a little more fuel to the flame! 
rec.sport.baseball	 Oh, come on. Everybody on the net has heard about "plausible deniability". You're not fooling anybody. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I've noticed that is has become fashionable lately in rsb to predict the Marlines to finish ahead of the Cubs....how? 
rec.sport.baseball	 I guarantee that if Bonds wins the MVP the Giants will finish higher than 6th. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Am I the only person who thinks the Reds sleeveless uniforms are ugly? Yet another reason why they won't win the NL West! ;) 
rec.sport.baseball	 I would assume that the words (I saw the picture) indicated that those SEATS will not be available for baseball games. If you look at the picture of the diamond in the stadium, in relation to the areas marked "NOT FOR BASEBALL", those seats just look terrible for watching baseball. Now, if they should happen to reach the post-season, I would imagine that they would consider opening some of those seats up, but that is surely a worry of the future. 
rec.sport.baseball	 record in baseball history (soon to be the best record again)? 
rec.sport.baseball	 They clobbered Cleveland, 9-1, on a fine pitching performance by Key, and two homeruns by Tartabull(first M.L.baseball to go out this season), and a three run homer by Nokes. For all of you who didn't pick Boggs in your pools, tough break, he had a couple hits, and drove in a couple runs(with many more to follow). The Yanks beat an up and coming team of youngsters in the Indians. The Yankees only need to win 95 more games to get the division. GO YANKS., Mattingly for g.glove, and MVP, and Abbot for Cy Young. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Do you realize that the yankees are paying Matt Nokes 2,500,000 dollars this year!!!! GEESH. And Maas only gets 125,000. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Yes, and the answer is simple. To create a better feeling in the park, the seats will be folded back for baseball games where you saw those words. 
rec.sport.baseball	 How many runs will be scored in Denver?' "I don't know. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Perhaps so. I was only responding to the "Yankees of the 20's and 30's" part of the comment. If those teams were a 'sure thing' and lost, then it's probably not so unreasonable for someone to pick another team (not that I did). 
rec.sport.baseball	 Maybe I'm just a child of the 80's, but I really liked the Marlins' uniforms. The helmets shine nicely in the sun. It's enough to make me a fan. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I was on vacation all last week and didn't see any news at all. Could somebody fill me in on how St. Louis ended up with Mark Whiten in a trade? Who did we give up Arocha, Allen Watson, Dmitri Young, or did Dal make a decent deal? 
rec.sport.baseball	 The tribe will be in town from April 16 to the 19th. There are ALWAYS tickets available! (Though they are playing Toronto, and many Toronto fans make the trip to Cleveland as it is easier to get tickets in Cleveland than in Toronto. Either way, I seriously doubt they will sell out until the end of the season.) 
rec.sport.baseball	 One of my favorites came back in the seventies when two streakers interupted a game Yogi was at, dashing across the field unclad. Later someone who wasn't present asked Yogi if they were men or women. He replied, "I couldn't tell, they had bags over their heads."

rec.sport.baseball	 Any more news on Steve's status since he lost the starting job would be appreciated 
rec.sport.baseball	 Most of this discussion has been between Mark Singer and David Tate, with Valentine weighing in on the same side as Dave at various times. My opinion, FWIW, to all: 
rec.sport.baseball	 I think the next time I post something like this, I obviously need to make the sarcasm a bit more obvious... 
rec.sport.baseball	 My vote goes for the ('75?) Indians with their all-red uniforms. Boog Powell once said he felt like a big red blood clot. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Here's one I remember: (sort of) Yogi's asleep in a hotel room late at night and gets a call from someone. After he answers the phone the person at the other end asks if he woke Yogi up. Yogi answered, "No, the phone did." 
rec.sport.baseball	 Since everyone else seems to be running wild with predictions, I've decided to add my own fuel to the fire: They might seem a bit normal, but there are a few (albeit, small) surprises. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Did anyone notice the words "NOT FOR BASEBALL" printed on the picture of Joe Robbie Stadium in the Opening Day season preview section in USA Today? Any reason given for this? 
rec.sport.baseball	 Can anybody name a player who was 'rushed' to the majors (let's, for argument's sake, define "rushed" as brought up to the majors for more than a cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger, and performing below expectations), whose career was damaged by this rushing? I'm serious; I tend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but I'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are any. I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can look up their minor league stats. (It's important to distinguish between players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers would have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers). 
rec.sport.baseball	 I tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues. The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they had little talent on their roster for some time. Steve Avery, for example, was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign. His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie year. Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Learn what? I know that 3 million dollars is A LOT of money. I know Rickey Henderson doesn't have a career out of baseball. I know if he didn't have baseball, he wouldn't be making near the money he is now. 
rec.sport.baseball	 The Angels won their home opener against the Brewers today before 33,000+ at Anaheim Stadium, 3-1 on a 3-hitter by Mark Langston. J.T. Snow and Gary Discarcina hit home runs for the Angels. 
rec.sport.baseball	 This is the crux of the argument (to me at least). Both the SDCN and the non-SDCN camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher's defense is basically nonmeasurable at present. You can talk about how important calling a game is, or framing the pitches, or blocking balls in the dirt. But there is little or no way to tell exactly how various catcher's rank in "defense". 
rec.sport.baseball	 Another word (offense) makes them my pick for last too. (Well, there's also my policy of never picking a Buck Rodgers' team for last) 
rec.sport.baseball	 If you think that's bad, just wait until he tries Dunston in the leadoff spot again. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I tell you, Steve Stone is like a prophet. He must be making a ton in the boradcoast booth because I can't understand why he's not actually back in the game itself. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Methinks you recall wrong. Mitchell hit close to .300 in Atlanta and continued to walk alot after his promotion. He was then (I think) left off the playoff roster, and started the next year in the minors where even the Braves will tell you he underperformed because he was so mad at going back down. 
rec.sport.baseball	 After the marvelous "time-out" call by Chris Webber (which resulted in a technical foul, since his team had no time-outs left) perhaps Webber will take the place of Bill Buckner as the master of choke. At least this Red Sox fan hopes so. 
rec.sport.baseball	 ekdfc@ttacs1.ttu.edu (David Coons): The rules say baseball is a game between two teams of nine players each. Let's keep it that way. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I am fortunate enough to have tickets for an Orioles-Red Sox game in Baltimore on Saturday, July 31st. I haven't been to the new park, and I was wondering if anyone out there can give me pointers or good tips or anything helpful about the place so that I can enjoy every moment spent there. For instance, what time do the gates open? Do we see the Orioles take BP? When will the Red Sox take BP? Anything you can tell me would be appreciated. Thank you in advance. Please respond to my e-mail address. I know it's still three-and-a-half months away, but I'm psyched! 
rec.sport.baseball	 Actually, I could care less what his salary is. It has something to do with the fact that we live in America, and everyone is entitled to whatever he can legally obtain. If Sandy Alderson and the Haas family willingly negotiate a salary of $35 million per year with Rickey, I couldn't care less. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Having run completely out of time, I've got to get my prophesies and predictions for the A.L. out. Qualifications -- one of the worse finishes in last year's prediction contest. 
rec.sport.baseball	 It depends. If you can get your old veterans cheap, and if they can perform at a higher level than your young talent can *now*, why not the talent develop in the minors while giving the fans some familiar names to cheer. If the veterans are gone in a year or two -- that should be just about right. 
rec.sport.baseball	 morgan and guzman will have era's 1 run higher than last year, and the cubs will be idiots and not pitch harkey as much as hibbard. castillo won't be good (i think he's a stud pitcher) 
rec.sport.baseball	 Avery was the #2 overall pick by the Braves, behind Mark Lewis (I think) in 1988. John Smoltz came over to the Braves from the Tigers, but was developed by the Braves. Jeff Blauser isn't a bad player. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Of all teams, I believe the Cubs have the best record ever in baseball. Sometime way far back. 110+ and something. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I don't know if you could call him rushed, but "Big" Ben McDonald didn't much time at all in the minors. Of course that was because the balls used in AAA had seams too large and gave McDonald blisters forcing him to go on the DL several times. He's done most of his learning here in the majors. Of course Gregg "Wild Thing" Olson and Mike "Deserved a Cy Young" Mussina didn't spend much time in the minors either. I read somewhere that pitchers are less likely to need that much time in the minors anyway so maybe that has something to do with it.' "Let's go O's! Why Not?

rec.sport.baseball	 I was watching the Dodgers/Marlins game yesterday and a couple of things impressed me. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I personally will never forget Mike Schmidt's home run against the Expos in 1980 that decided the NL East. It was also his career high 48th. 
rec.sport.baseball	 This talk about the Phillies winning the NL East is scary. VERY scary! Don't get me wrong, Im a Phillies fan but as late as last year they looked helpless. The funny thing was they did have a lot of injuries in '92 spring training that basically killed their chances. Of course, don't forget the Dykstra wrist injury in the first or second game? 
rec.sport.baseball	 After reading my local paper today, I found out that the Phillies started the 1964 season at 10-2. I am not as old as 1964, but I've heard many talk about the serious choke job the Phillies did that season. They were ahead of the Cardinals by 15 games that season in mid-August. They managed to lose a bunch from then on and the Cardinals took the division. 15!!! games ahead and lost it.... I hope this season is MUCH different. 
rec.sport.baseball	 This is fascinating. You say that Alomar was the better hitter last year, and immediately follow that up with numbers showing that Baerga had a better year. The only category that I see which shows an advantage for Alomar is OBP. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I don't." '--Shannon "Cardinals fan" Kohl 
rec.sport.baseball	 Of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented. Just as a penny saved is a penny earned. Enough with the cliches. My point is that IF the Braves starters are able to live up to their potential, they won't need much offensive support. I realize this is a BIG IF. This staff leaves the '92 BoSox in the dust. There is no legitimate comparison. Two Cy Young winners, and three other pitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first or second starter. It seems to me that when quality pitchers take the mound, the other teams score less runs. The team that scores the most runs wins. This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage (providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs). A low scoring game would clearly benefit the Braves. They should have many low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting. On the flip side, if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players, I would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers. They would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their opponent. The name of the games is to win. Even Ray Knight knows that you do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard. All I'm trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers like the Braves have, the offense doesn't need to be as strong. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Count me interested in a Cardinal's mailing list. If anyone finds one or starts one, please let me know. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I think he just wanted to get Henneman some work, because the Tigers had days off both the day before and the day after. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Davis will be paid by three clubs this year, I think the Phils are responsbible for about $600,000 or so. They didn't wait for him to clear waivers as three other clubs were also very interested in him. A gamble? Yes. 
rec.sport.baseball	 A month? Well, he did have a short career--compared to what one might have expected for such a highly touted prospect--due to being injury prone, overweight, and having no work ethic. But he certainly did not suffer from being rushed to the bigs. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I read this morning that Sid Fernandez left last nights' game with stiffness in his shoulder. Does anyone have any information as to the extent of the injury (if indeed there is one), or weather the cold air in Colorado just got his joints a little stiff? 
rec.sport.baseball	 No one says you have to read any of it Ralph.. Go play in traffic.., or take a nap... They work for me.. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I would like to make everyone aware that in winning the NL West the Atlanta Braves did not lead wire-to-wire. Through games of 4/14/93 the Houston Astros are percentage points ahead of the "unbeatable" Braves.

rec.sport.baseball	 Rogers is the "one-batter lefty" in the bullpen. Dusty has also said he trusts Rogers to get the final out in a ballgame where Beck is unavailable, so you might see a couple of saves for Kevin. Then again, if any of the regular rotation falters, Rogers is a possible candidate to start, though this would appear less likely now that Dave Burba did well in an emergency start. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Last year Brein Taylor was in A ball, probably at Tampa in the Florida State League. I believe he began this year in AA which is Albany. Hopefully George won't rush him and he'll be allowed to progress at his own rate to AAA and then to the Bronx. This guy is the real thing. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Does any one out there listen to WFAN? For those of you who do not know what I am talking about, it is an all sports radio staion in New York.

rec.sport.baseball	 Geez, Dal must have slipped something into Ted's drink sometime. Comparing Prince to Pagnozzi offensively is laughable. Prince has never hit well in the minors and he's now 27 years old, I think. Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter in the minors. (I'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I don't have another brain cramp and forget.) He had a very good year at Louisville before coming up to the majors. As I recall, the hype on Pagnozzi coming up in the organization was good hit, decent fielding. When he got to the majors and didn't hit as well as expected (not as much playing time?), he became Exhibit 312 in Nichols' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation as an outstanding defensive catcher. It's not clear he ever learned to hit. His four years with more than 100 AB-- 
rec.sport.baseball	 I missed the original post, but aren't the Expos rushing alomost their entire team this year? I am from Montreal, and am a fan, but geez, the Expos rank 27th in salary (only the Rockies trail) and someone at the average age would probably be in first year University! CorelMARK! 
rec.sport.baseball	 Wetteland comes off the DL on April 23rd, and will be evaluated on the 24th. He is throwing well, and without pain on the side. 
rec.sport.baseball	 While Atlanta has the undisputed best starting rotation, I feel that their relief staff may be suspect. They don't have a real closer -- although Mike Stanton (4 saves) has been used in that role. Didn't Stanton start off great last year and then falter? Despite this, your point is well taken. Atlanta doesn't seem to have the same personality as a NY team, thus is unlikely to self-destruct. For Houston to take 'em, Atlanta needs to suffer some injuries, particularly to their starting rotation.

rec.sport.baseball	 From another not-so-distressed-but-still-wondering-about-a-few-things Cardinal fan: 
rec.sport.baseball	 Are you for real? How many Gold Gloves does Ozzie Smith have? If a guy hung around and hit 30 homers a year for 15 years, wouldn't he be a given for the Hall? Is defense not just as important? And if Robin Yount couldn't hit, why would he have stuck around long enough to get 3,000 hits? Are you saying 3,000 hits is a fluke? 3,000 hits is no big deal? 
rec.sport.baseball	 The FAN is an okay Sports Radio station, but doesn't come close to the ULTIMATE in Sports Radio, 610 WIP in Philadelphia. The signal might not be as powerful, but then again only stations in New York feel "obligated" to pollute everyone else's airwaves with a bunch of hoodlum Mets fans complaining 24 hours a day. WIP took two of your best sports jockeys too, Jody MacDonald and Steve Fredericks. 610 WIP is rockin with sports talk from 5:30 AM till midnight, check it out anytime your within a few hours of Philadelphia. If I'm not mistaken, WIP has the highest sports talk ratings in the nation? 
rec.sport.baseball	 It was my impression watching the Mets & Rockies that umpires were calling strikes above the belt, too, but not as far up as the letters. It would be nice if this were the case. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I was wondering if anyone had any kind of Fenway Park gif. I would appreciate it if someone could send me one. Thanks in advance. 
rec.sport.baseball	 What's the difference between Nolan Ryan and Yount? Both have hung around for years, and continue to post great stats. Why shouldn't Dave Kingman get into the Hall? Or Murray, Evens, Reardon, and others? What the hell do you have to do? Ask an opposing pitcher whether he thinks that Winfield should be in the hall... God. Pretty soon you'll be saying that Cal Ripken doesn't deserve to be in the Hall. Then, I'll flame you. :-)

My SI subscription expired this past February, the second of two years that I received same. Therefore my guess is that the article appeared sometime in 1991-92. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Strictly from memory, I think the Phillies were something like ten games up with 12 to go, lost 10 in a row, and 11 of last 12 to lose to the Cardinals. Seems impossible, but thats how I remember it. I also felt at the time that Johnny Callison of the Phillies lost the MVP as a by-product of their swoon. 
rec.sport.baseball	 This list brings to mind possible the worst trade since Babe for NONO NANNETTE, i.e., Milt Pappas for Frank Robinson, I think in 1965 ?. Robinson proceeded to win the triple crown in 1966 and may have beaten out Yaz in '67 but was injured on a slide into second when he collided with the mighty Al Weis (Chisox). 
rec.sport.baseball	 The New York talk shows are just awful in this regard. People are constantly calling WFAN and WABC with (stuff like) "I was thinking, why don't the Yankees trade Kaminicki and Silvestri to Seattle for Ken Griffey Jr and Randy Johnson, that would really help the team" or "Do you think the Yankees can get Roger Clemens?". The show hosts are pretty good about handling these guys, but it's still annoying. 
rec.sport.baseball	 On behalf of the rest of us Tiger fans out here, I appoligize for this shameless woofing. We try to keep it to a minimum, but we did WIN A GAME the other day, so sometimes it's hard to control. see: Phillies Fans 
rec.sport.baseball	 That's because Lankford had a minor injury from a couple of games before that and was day-to-day... only available as a pinchrunner. 
rec.sport.baseball	 He evidentally got hit in the elbow by a Fernando pitch. His arm swelled from the elbow to the wrist (or something like that). They took X-rays of the arm and there is nothing damaged. He missed the last game with the Orioles, but he is suppose to be ready for the next game. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Actually, for the Padres this year so far it's 23%. They are 5th in the league in HRs, and ALL have been solo shots. 
rec.sport.baseball	 defense to improve (hopefully). He has that rep because I heard that either last year, or over the last 5 years, or something like that - he has the third highest fielding percentage among major league shortstops - behind C.R. and Tony (I'm not gonna help this sorry Mets team at all) Fernandez. I do agree though that he has not looked all that impressive in the field thus far. 
rec.sport.baseball	 No....Hal McRae is the worst manager in baseball. I've never seen a guy who can waste talent like he can. One of the best raw-talent staffs in the league, and he's still finding a way to lose. I'll be surprised if he makes it through the next 2 weeks, unless drastic improvement is made. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Frankly, no. Offense and defense are equally important. But the pitcher is 80% of the defense. The primary role of every other player is on offense. Even shortstops are a bigger part of the offensive game than of the defensive game. (They might not do much with their part of the offense, but that's another issue.) 
rec.sport.baseball	 Look, asshole, I got him confused with somebody else. I didn't flame you, and I would appreciate it if you extended me the same courtesy. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Clemens is going on his normal four days' rest (last pitched Saturday). Hesketh only pitched one inning yesterday afternoon, his first outing since an aborted 1-1/3 inning start 6 days before, so he should be plenty rested to go in his expected turn this Saturday, as the 5th starter. Not that this is a good thing, of course. I'd like to see a well-managed four-man rotation with this team... 
rec.sport.baseball	 It's Stankiewicz, not Stankowitz, and he's not Jewish - he's Polish (by the way, the correct pronunciation - according to Stanky himself, is "ston-KEV-itch". all the sportscasters get it wrong) 
rec.sport.baseball	 What _is_ your problem? Hite's post wasn't a flame. It was a correction of *your* error. 
rec.sport.baseball	 And thus, we come to one of the true beauties of baseball; these things, along with many others will never be separated. Almost *everything* in baseball is situational and interdependent. This is what allows us to carry on all the arguments that we have. If everything could be explained and balanced on a statistical basis, none of the wonder and mystery would be left. Why we might have to resort to just going out the ballyard and enjoy the game itself. 
rec.sport.baseball	 It's always possible, but if this is the case, I think that there is some blatant discrimination going on here. Clearly Selig is allowing the opposition to use pre-1920 baseballs against the Dodgers. 
rec.sport.baseball	 my understanding was that ted turner (owner of the braves) started running his tv station nationwide, and started running all of his team's games on his nationwide tv station, he dubbed his team ''america's team'' - that is, the only team (at least, at the time) all of whose games could be seen across america.

I do this as a service to the entire baseball world on USENET, especially for those in the East Coast who can't get final scores for West Coast games in their newspapers or late TV newscasts. This is helpful to fans in other countries who either receive only weekly scores or updates by the week.

By the way, mine is free of charge and has no copyright restrictions. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Probably because everyone (that is, everyone who has cable) can watch every Braves game. They are the only team that has all of its games broadcast nationwide. And if you don't like your local team, or you don't have a local team, the Braves can kind of become your local team because you can watch them every day.

rec.sport.baseball	 Actually I admired the spirit of the fan at the Cubs opener several years ago who held up a sign that said "Wait Till Next Year". 
rec.sport.baseball	 Oh, lighten up. What depresses me is that they might actually finish last, which I believe hasn't happened since their second season in 1970. Never mind that Gubizca is 0-2 with a 16.50 ERA, Gardner at 7.50, our main recent acquisitions (Lind, McReynolds, Jose) are averaging .210, David Cone is 0-2 (about how he was doing in KC before joining the Mets several years ago), our hitting sucks, and our pitching has collapsed, and we've won one game at home; they've won more games in their first ten games than last year, and Brian McRae is actually batting over the Mendoza line!

rec.sport.baseball	 Why? Do you expect him to remain the best shortstop in the game until he reaches his seventy-third birthday, or something? Why is it such a strange concept that a forty-one-year-old Ozzie Smith might be a defensive liability in 1996? 
rec.sport.baseball	 Whoops! I meant Mountain Time. P. Tierney 
rec.sport.baseball	 Why? Do you suppose he's immune to the ravages of time? He's 37. In a few years he'll be 40. He doesn't get to as many grounders as he used to, and will get to fewer still as his legs go, as they do on every human so far.

rec.sport.baseball	 Has anyone heard anything about Mel Hall this season? I'd heard he wasn't with the Yankees any more. What happened to him? 
rec.sport.baseball	 Is this the book by Bob Klapisch (spelling?), "The Worst Team Money Can Buy"? If it is, I wouldn't give the book, or anything in it any value whatsoever. Klapisch wrote the book to make money (obviously) and sensational literature is going to sell a lot better than what he usually writes for the papers. I'm not calling him a liar, but if there was any proof that a Met player had raped a little girl before a game (let alone doing it on a regular basis) they would be in jail, not Shea. For those people who do not know what the press is like in New York, it is probably more cut-throat than in just about any other part of the U.S. Keith Hernandez said it very well on ESPN a couple of days ago, they would much rather mention a clubhouse fight, than a two-run homer in the ninth to win a game. I do not read Klapisch's news columns regularly, but I do know that he has been accused before as being an instigator that enjoys (hopefully for only professional reasons) to drumb up a news story, even if there isn't one there. Now as far as the confrontation with Bobby Bonilla a few days ago, I almost totally blame Bonilla. No matter what a member of the press does, and no matter how much of a putrid individual he might be, that does not give a ballplayer the right to threaten a journalist. Personally, I always thought that a beat writer that always follows a club around should report the news, but not be looking to degrade a team. I don't know whether to blame Klapisch, because that may be the only way to keep a job in New York.

rec.sport.baseball	 Foolish me. And here I thought it had something to do with the fact that they were hitting against Wakefield, who had no "kncukle" to his ball that day, and Otto, who has no stuff. I wonder if Reggie gave the same pep talk and instruction to the rest of the lineup, who also suddenly came alive those two games. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I am trying to get a copy of the _official_ rules of baseball. Someone once sent me the ISBN number of it, but I have since lost it. Can anyone give me this information, or tell me where I can find the book? None of my local bookstores have it.

rec.sport.baseball	 The defenition of the Underdog is a team that has no talent and comes out of nowhere to contend. The '69 Mets and '89 Orioles are prime examples, not the Cubs. I root for the Cubs, because I feel sorry for them, but basically they are dogs. The Pirates today are a great example of an underdog. If the Rockies and Marlins compete, they will be underdogs. The North Stars trip to the Stanley Cup finals was a good example of an underdog's journey. The Cubs have a good team this year, and play in a weak division, they are much less than America's Team. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Were they palying football or baseball in Detroit on Saturday? From looking at the school, some people may think it was football. Between two games this week, the Tigers scored 40 runs!!!! The offense can carry them, I hope the pitching will hold out. I was at Camden Yards yesterday, everytime I looked up the score was getting higher. What a great site it was to see the Tigers kicking butt while enjoying a game at Camden Yards. GO TIGERS AND GO TONY PHILLIPS!!!!!!!!

rec.sport.baseball	 OK, the Mets and O's are good examples, but what about the '90 Reds? Do you really think that anyone expected them to sweep the A's? I know people who didn't even think they'd win a game, let alone win the Series. We proved them wrong, though, didn't we? 
rec.sport.baseball	 A little delayed, but in the interests of fairness (stats from Elias); BA OBP SLG R HR RBI RNI % outs Alomar .310 .405 .427 105 8 76 264 20.5 419 Baerga .312 .354 .455 92 20 105 316 21.2 480 
rec.sport.baseball	 How does one read the betting spreads for baseball? They tend to be something like 8-9 which means it must not be runs! 
rec.sport.baseball	 Once again, the Rockies bullpen fell apart. Andy Ashby pitched six (somewhat shaky) innings giving up just one run. Then game the dreaded relief. Three picthers combined to give up 3 runs (one each I believe) in the 7th inning and blew the save opportunity. (Final was 4-2 vs Expos). 
rec.sport.baseball	 that spread means you bet $5 on the underdog to win $8, or $9 on the favorite to win $5. 
rec.sport.baseball	 As long as the Yankees are in the same division the Red Sox will play better than .500 baseball. 
rec.sport.baseball	 B.S. about darkness deleted. tOh, lighten up. What depresses me is that they might actually finish last, which I believe hasn't happened since their second season in 1970. nope The Royals are the only team in the majors that have not finished in last place. ^^^^ Of course this doesn't include the marlins and the rockies but they have a good chance at finishing last also. rich. 
rec.sport.baseball	 But good ones can collapse somewhat, then come back the next year. Burleigh Grimes went from 20+ wins and an ERA of 3 or so in '24 to 13-19 and an ERA around 4 in '25. He pitched well for several more years. Carlton won 13 and lost 20 the year after his 27-10 record. (Source: Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract.) And let's not forget John Tudor, who started 1-5 and finished 21-6 in 1985. He had a pretty bad ERA when you take Busch Stadium into account at the start of the season. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Kevin Mitchell's sacrifice fly in the eighth off Brett Saberhagen plated pitch runner Cesar Hernandez to give the Reds a 2-3 come-from-behind victory over New York. Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started with a solid single to right, moved to second on "Bob" Kelly's infield sneaker down the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson's well-placed bunt--a rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Would you say the same thing about the Dodgers in '65 or '66? True, Cone is probably as good as Drysdale, and they have no Koufax, but still, these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals, with lots of low-scoring games, etc. And they didn't use relievers, whereas Jeff Montgomery is having a super season for them. That being said, I still picked them 5th or so, but I think a superb pitching team can win if they have enough hitting. There's more of a chance of that, I think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but no pitching. At least, to me. I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a team with Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no real order, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, but with a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.) Or a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig, Mays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order. I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by seasons' end. Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time in their best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking all the players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year. And all the offense would have to do is get 1 run across. I wonder if someone with Stratomatic or something could plug such all- time teams into a regular season, have it played, and report the results I would love to see that. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I am hoping to produce the first update of the BB DDD this week; please send info about the most significant (longest, most critical, etc.) home run that you have seen yet this season. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Sorry, but I saw a survey somewhere that showed that America's favorite team is the Damn Yankees. So much for the underdogs being loved. 
rec.sport.baseball	 What position does Mike Lansing play? I cannot seem to find it anywhere. Thanks!!!!1 
rec.sport.baseball	 The roar at Michigan and Trumbull should be loader than ever this year. With Mike Illitch at the head and Ernie Harwell back at the booth, the tiger bats will bang this summer. Already they have scored 20 runs in two games and with Fielder, Tettleton, and Deer I think they can win the division. No pitching! Bull! Gully, Moore, Wells, and Krueger make up a decent staff that will keep the team into many games. Then there is Henneman to close it out. Watch out Boston, Toronto, and Baltimore - the Motor City Kittys are back. 
rec.sport.baseball	 To all those out there wondering about who holds the record for three homer games ina career, the answer is Johnny Mize in his career with the Cards and the Yanks. He hit three 6 times. I am almost sure about this. In case anyone is wondering, the record for two homer games is held by Babe Ruth and is 72. Mize's record may not last for much longer because of Juan Gonzalez. He has at least three games with three and maybe 4. I know that he had at least two last year and one as a rookie. I don't have any record books at college for me to check on though. Please let me know, okay, if I am wrong. Onto the Padres. Is there anyone out there who follows them?- especial-ly those with access to local news? I don't here anything in Los Angeles and I can't get McPaper consistently around here. comment: It looks as though San Diego has gotten the better of the two deals that brought Bell and Plantier to the Padres. It has also forced the team to use Darrell Shermann. Of course, Plantier could get injured again or he could hit with the power of 91 but with a lower average. Bell always could finish with .240 and 15-18 hrs-essentially Jerald Clark's numbers. leadoff comment: Craig Shipley?????? I get on base 29% of the time if I'm lucky at leadoff? Hell, of the usual starters, use Gwynn. He's got 4 steals already. Is Shipley starting because of an injury to Stillwell, though? I haven't seen Stillwell's name in any box scores. Anyway unless you are going to use Shermann at leadoff then use Gwynn. He at lesat gets on base and this year is stealing bases. Sheffield comment: Though the season is early and stats mean nothing. Witness Phillips batting .500+ currently. But does Sheffield have an injury, or anythingelse wrong with him. I just don't hear anything. Andy Benes: Is he pitching like he did in the second half of '91? or is this a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then? Has anyone seen him pitch the two good games? score for today, Sunday april 18: Padres 10, St Louis 6. Padres sweep the Cardinals as Gwynn goes 5 for 5 with a homer. Sheffield and Tueful also homer in a winning cause. Thanks for listening-reading any comments????

rec.sport.baseball	 nice woofing (or should i say meowing?). and yes, the Tiggers are a fun, exciting team that i would pay to see. but last year, they went 75-87. this year, their offense is essentially the same, and their pitching is, at best, essentially the same. so why do you think they will suddenly improve to win the 92 or so games which will be required to win the A.L. East? what has changed that i don't see? 
rec.sport.baseball	 Hey Valentine, I don't see Boston with any world series rings on their fingers. Damn, Morris now has three and probably the Hall of Fame in his future. Therefore, I would have to say Toronto easily made the best signing. And don't tell me Boston will win this year. They won't even be in the top 4 in the division, more like 6th. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Uh, I don't think you can call a team with Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman, and Nolan Ryan on the pitching staff a team that has "no talent." They did come out of nowhere, but some of the improvement was forseeable. 
rec.sport.baseball	 These people were very silly. Any team that gets to the World Series can win the World Series, and anybody who ever expects a sweep is crazy. If you put the best team in baseball in the Series against the worst team in baseball, the worst team would win at least a game most of the time and very well could win the Series, though the odds would certainly be against them. 
rec.sport.baseball	 e, Later, in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts lankford, a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses Luis Alicea, a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter. What the Helll is he thinking.

Remember that feisty reporter that entered the New England Patriots locker room? She started crying like a LITTLE GIRL! I just don't think women belong in a man's sport. Before you smart guys flame me for this, I know the given example was about football. Who cares? It still applies to other MALE sports. How can we have women umpires? Jeez! Look at Pam Postema. Just because she's a woman, everybody on the face of the earth thinks it's great that she's getting an opportunity to ump. If you even watched the games and had an IQ greater than that of roast beef, you'd see that she is not nearly as good as most AAA umpires. Besides, she is probably more worried about cracking a fingernail with a foul tip off of Wade Boggs' bat. Or Jose Oquendo's bat. Either way, there are too many complications. 
rec.sport.baseball	 There are two conflicting reports about a pitcher that is either in the Jays' farm system or the Braves'. His name is Bill Taylor. He was picked up by the Jays, but had to be offered back to the Braves before they were able to send him to the Syracuse Chiefs. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Sorry, but this is the biggest load of bunk I've seen in a while. a) The Pirates have been trying to trade LaValliere for some time now. Nobody was even vaguely interested. b) Several other teams had made it known that they would grab Prince, who was out of options. c) LaValliere's release had nothing to do with him being through. He was released, because, in the event of an injury to Slaught, LaValliere is no longer capable (they believe) of being the everyday catcher. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Ted, you're missing a vital point. As Roger Lustig pointed out in a previous response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was because she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on a constant basis. Such thoughts affected her hiring practices. Bonilla, on the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time. If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a different story. Furthermore, he is merely an athlete. He doesn't have to hire anyone as Schott had to do. Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is an admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets game at Shea. He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from baseball. Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension. In my opinion, that's downright ludicrous. As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you start suspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time under whatever conditions, then you'd probably have enough people remaining to play a three-on-three game. Now, honestly, if you truly analyze the differences between the two cases that you bring up in your article, I would think that you'd reconsider your thoughts. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Gee, I never knew Valentine made a comment about how Viola signing with Boston was gonna bring a World Series title to Boston. I don't think Valentine ever said Boston will win this year. Boy, talk about sensitive, insecure Toronto fans. :) 
rec.sport.baseball	 i have no idea, nor do i care. however, i'd like to point out that blomberg got the first plate appearance by a designated hitter, and the first walk by a designated hitter. i am not sure, but i do not think that he also got the first hit by a designated hitter. 
rec.sport.baseball	 how do you know this? did lasorda say, before the game, "here's the lineup i'm using. i'm batting strawman fourth because the primadonna insists on batting cleanup"? 
rec.sport.baseball	 and bill james is not? yeah. sure. do you own "the bill james players rating book"? 
rec.sport.baseball	 The Phillies salvaged their weekend series against the Chicago Cubs by beating them 11-10 in a wild one at Wrigley Field Sunday afternoon. It was the Phils only win in the three game series, and was the first time the Phillies have lost a series in the young season. The Phils jumped to a 6-0 lead in the game thanks to 2 John Kruk 2-run homers and two Wes Chamberlain homers. However Danny Jackson, and the Phillies middle relief was unable to hold the lead. Mitch Williams entered the game with the Phillies leading 8-4, however Candy Maldonado hit a ninth inning homerun to tie it. In the 11th, Dave Hollins hit a three-run shot, his first of the year to push the Phils ahead to stay. However, in a shaky bottom of the 11th the Cubs scored 2 runs and had the tying runner on base when the Cubs pinch hit Randy Myers for Bob Scanlan (they were out of position players) and Myers bunted into a double play to end the game. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Well, I agree that Viola is a better signing. However, why does everyone say that you want lefthanded starters? I understand lefthanded spot relievers, even though they usually face more righthanded batters than lefthanded batters. I just don't understand why people insist on lefthanded starters, unless there is a park effect (e.g., Yankee Stadium). Most batters in MLB are righthanded, so righthanded starters will have the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters. I guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams may be more vulnerable to LHP's than RHP's. However, this is probably only a factor in the postseason, because teams seldom juggle their starters for this reason during the regular season. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Lou wanted Morris all along. The idiot. Giving the man $40 million to play with is like giving a five year old a loaded Uzi with the safety off. The only question is how many shots he will get off before somebody is wise enough to take it away. 
rec.sport.baseball	 He's a shortstop by training, but he's been at second (mostly) and third this year for the Expos. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Whatever you say. I think it's just 12 games into the season myself, so I'm going to wait a bit before calling names. 
rec.sport.baseball	 The Dodgers have been shopping Harris to other teams in their quest for more left-handed pitching. So far, no takers. Personally, I think Harris is a defensive liability, and he has also led the team in past years for hitting into double plays, or at least been among the leaders. 
rec.sport.baseball	 And they deserve to be, if for no other reason than salvaging a little of the honor of the NL West. The supposed strongest division in baseball lost 6 of 7 to the East yesterday, with only the Astros prevailing. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Judging by the way the Reds' pitchers have performed thus far, it appears to me that the zone has been squeezed to the size of a grape. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Huh? Clemens pitched last on Saturday, giving him his usual four days rest. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Owen only has one error so far, I believe. That seriously underrepresents the harm he has done in the field. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Not clear to me at all. I'd certainly rather have a team who was winning 4-1 games than 2-1 games. In the 2-1 game, luck is going to play a much bigger role than in the 4-1 game. 
rec.sport.baseball	 The umps saw the weekend boxscores, too. They knew the pitchers needed some help or they would be watching the sunrise. :) 
rec.sport.baseball	 Does anyone know where Billy Taylor is? Richmond or Syracuse? He was taken by the Jays in the Rule V draft, but not kept on the roster. Baseball Weekly said that he was demoted to Syracuse, but a Toronto paper indicated that the Braves took him back. Is there an Atlanta fan, or anyone reading this, who knows? 
rec.sport.baseball	 Compiled from the last five Defensive Average reports, here are the career DAs for the individual players in the reports. Stats are courtesy of Sherri Nichols. Players are listed in descending order. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Dave Winfield's name does not go in the same sentence. As Aaron, Robinson, and Ott. 
rec.sport.baseball	 what t I've seen so far. He doesn't pitch pretty, but he gets the job done. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Farr's ERA is in the t 20s or 30s, and Howe's is.....infinite. (I didn't think such t a thing was possible, but it is). 
rec.sport.baseball	 I'll tell youm all one thing. Steve howe and FARR are much better then the worst pitcher in yankee Pitching ___________________ 
rec.sport.baseball	 Thanks Alan, that was well thought out. Even written in an entertaining style. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Oh, yeah. Dave Winfield--marginal player. Guy didn't hit a lick, had negligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power. Dave Winfield, now entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent hitter. Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime, he had a powerful arm and great range. Take a look at the stats: I don't know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are similar players. Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field, he ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his OBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important) was a absolute-primo-dick. Eddie Murray? Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's. I know that MVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the MVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media. Lee Smith? Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close. He's had a s solid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks (Wrigley, Fenway...). I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been a while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber. You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers, simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you blow a bunch, too. Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month) Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves. No way should HomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO. Darrell Evans? Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like Ted Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Darryl Strawberry's moon shots were fun! He can hit those high and far home runs that if he actually ran them out he'd be rounding second base by the time they landed. We used to say that he should have to file a flight plan at LaGuardia for some of them. Then _Bull_Durham_ came out and that was changed. :-) 
rec.sport.baseball	 Maybe because baseball is the only business where those who are responsible for the fiscal aspects of the game preach gloom and doom. These allegedly intelligent people seem to predict bad times, losing money, bankruptcies at an alarming rate, and there's going to be an increased degradation of the product they produce. Could you imagine IBM, with all their problems, promoting themselves the way Major League Baseball does? Their stock would plummet to unthinkable depths (not that they are too far from it now :-). What would happen at GM? Where would GM be if they admitted to cutting corners and producing an inferior product because of alleged labor problems? I think it shows a lack of confidence for the people who run the game. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Boy, hats off to any Cubs fan who can actually muster up the courage to put down Braves fans. I mean, all the Braves have done is gone to two consecutive world series. Also, being the Cubs fan that I am, I really have to hand it to all the Braves fans out there that are capable of driving me crazy with that infernal cheer that they have. 
rec.sport.baseball	 For the second straight game, California scored a ton of late runs to crush the Brewhas. It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five in the 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitched seven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has pitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest on the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch! 
rec.sport.baseball	 One of the chapters in Palmer and Thorn's 'Hidden Game' is titled 'Pitching is 44% of Baseball,' implying that fielding is 6%. How do they determine that? Beats me -- it's been a long, long time since I read it.

rec.sport.baseball	 Tigers' manager Sparky Anderson gets his 2,000th career win as moments ago, the Tigers completed a two game sweep over the Oakland A's at Tiger Stadium by beating the A's 3-2. Here are the highlights: 
rec.sport.baseball	 I've been saying that for at least 2 years now and even the A's conditioning guru told Jose he was carrying too much weight and losing some would help his back.Although I don't for one second believe Jose used steroids,his back problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience because they are simply carrying too much weight on their frame(see Jeff Bregel ex 49er as a textbook example), and IMHO Jose is too big for his frame. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Roberts was long gone -- he was probably an Oriole in 1964. Or maybe a Colt .45. The 3rd starter was Art Mahaffey, the previous year's ace. Dennis Bennett was the 4th starter. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I basically agree, the Tigers are my favorite team. Actually, their pitching might actually be better this year than last (not that htat's saying a hole lot). How 'bout that home opener on Tuesday!! By the way, Sparky goes for win 2,000 today. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I haven't seen enough Royals' games to judge his tactics, so you may have a point here. But: 
rec.sport.baseball	 Just wondering. A friend and I were talking the other day, and we were (for some reason) trying to come up with names of Jewish baseball players, past and present. We weren't able to come up with much, except for Sandy Koufax, (somebody) Stankowitz, and maybe John Lowenstein. Can anyone come up with any more. I know it sounds pretty lame to be racking our brains over this, but humor us. Thanks for your help. 
rec.sport.baseball	 You're right about the signal being strong. I live in West Philadelphia, and I can get FAN almost perfectly. It's a sports fans dream (especially if that person is from NY and wants to hear about his teams while he's away at school). As for Lupica & Berman, it's turned out to be Lupica, then Berman. Neither of them wanted to work a full four hour show, so Ed Coleman and Dave Sims' old four-hour slot was broken down into two seperate two-hour show - Lupica from 10-12, and Berman from 12-2. And they both happen to suck in comparison to Eddie and Dave. COME BACK, GUYS! 
rec.sport.baseball	 Alomar fans left RBI fans and Runs off this list because they are dependant on the team. (To a large extent). If Frank Thomas hit first, he'd lose a LOT of RBI's; and anyways how many 2nd place hitters have you known to drive in 100 runs? Doesn't happen that often.....very unlikely with Devon White's ~.300 OBP in front of you... 
rec.sport.baseball	 Hank Greenberg would have to be the most famous, because his Jewish faith actually affected his play. (missing late season or was it world series games because of Yom Kippur) 
rec.sport.baseball	 I'm looking for software (hopefully free and runs on Unix box) which will keep track of statistics for my company softball team (batting avg. etc.). 
rec.sport.baseball	 According to the Defensive Average stats posted by Sherri, Baerga had the highest percentage of DPs turned in the league, while Alomar had the worst. However, Alomar had a higher Defensive Average. So who would be better? 
rec.sport.baseball	 Doug, those stats are great! they help immensely. I tried to E-Mail you with some comments on them but my mail server does not recognize your address. Could you E-Mail me with some info on how to get E-Mail to you? Thanks! 
rec.sport.baseball	 No, no no. The Ack man is apparently an alien life-form, much like the pod people from planet Mars, who can take on any form (the ability remains the same, however). The Ack-people have been spotted on many teams to date, but it appears that the Orioles staff (mentioned above) and the Expos bullpen (Barnes, Walton, Fassero, Gardiner and Rojas) have been the prime target. Apparently John Wetteland was roughed up by the Ack-people during spring training due to the fact that his system rejected the takeover, and has been on the DL ever since. Contact the authorities! This evil plot must be stopped! (the Ack-people can keep Jack Morris and Juan Guzman, though. I enjoy watching Toronto fans suffer too much to want these guys returned to normal ;-) 
rec.sport.baseball	 KC(?) news was doing a report on that. They said that McRae is really a batting coach and not a manager. But for some reason he took the job. Whatever the reason, the Royals need a new manager now...while it is too late. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Me, too... RBI are a worthless stat. Of course, so is stolen bases because sometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run. And of course pitchers pitch differently with different people on different bases, so batting average, slugging and obp out, too. Hmmm... i guess homers would not count then, either. My point? RBI might not be a perfect stat but nothing is. And no stat (or lack of) can tell me there are no clutch hitters. Maybe no stat CAN tell me, either, but some people are... I just know it!!! 8) 
rec.sport.baseball	 I am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling or perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points. However, I think you approached this the wrong way. I believe all of the people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I feel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to go but that they would deserve it more. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Here is the OPI (Offensive Production Index) for all AL players with at least 10 at bats.

All their merchandise is handmade and is an authentic replica. I own a couple - and they are excellent. They also have wool caps and jackets. You should call to get on their mailing list even if you can't afford their prices. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Nolan Ryan has torn cartlidge inhis right knee. Is having surgery and is expected to miss 2-5 weeks. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Well, the Red Sox have apparenly resigned Herm Winningham to a AAA contract. Ted "Larry" Simmons signed him to a AAA contract then released him from Buffalo, allowing Lou "Curly" Gorman to circumvent the rule about not resigning free agents until May 1. Clearly, neither of these guys is bright enough to be Moe. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Hmmm...what about walks and SB? Baerga got clobbered by Alomar in OBP and beat him in SLG by a lesser margin. Even putting aside any other factors, a player with a 51 point edge in OBP is more productive than a player with a 28 point edge in SLG. The issue has been studied before, and I doubt you could come up with any convincing argument the other way. People see the batting average and the HR, but they don't really know their value is worth unless they've studied the issue closely. The fact is that Baerga ate up a LOT more outs than Alomar; while Baerga was making outs, Alomar was drawing walks and being on base for Carter, Winfield et.al. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I'm pretty sure that Sandberg has done this at least once. (I know someone will correct me if I'm wrong.) 
rec.sport.baseball	 Educate yourself before you rip on this years manager of the year. Lankford injured himself in a previous game and Torre was resting him. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Hank Greenberg was probably the greatest ever. He was also subject to a lot of heckling from bigots on the opposing teams and in the stands, but it never seemed to affect his performance negatively. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Do you think Omar's grand slam is the result of his new fan club? Last week a banner appeared in the Kingdome:

rec.sport.baseball	 Article from as follows From: bml2@ns1.cc.lehigh.edu (BRIAN MICHAEL LUCY) Subject: Re: Let's Talk Phillies" 'Date: 15 Apr 93 06:29:05 GMT Organization: Lehigh University Lines: 9 
rec.sport.baseball	 I was *hoping* somebody would mention clutch. Clutch? Baerga? The two words simply do not go together. With runners in scoring position, Baerga batted .308/.366/.418 last year. This doesn't quite *suck*, but most batters hit *better* in this situation. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Unfortunately, you seem to lack the ability to rate players. Dave Winfield has had a better career than half the people in the Hall of Fame. Eddie Murray and Darrel Evans are both one of the top 100 players of all time. Lee Smith has had probably the greatest long career of any relief pitcher since 1960, with the possible exception of Gossage. 
rec.sport.baseball	 two (2) plans for a new Phillies stadium: the already-mentioned 30th Street Station proposal, and a location near Broad Street and Race Street, I think. I can't remember the exact details, but the stadium would be build practically downtown. There is a small lot that could be used, according to the paper. The 30th street plan has run into some trouble, because Amtrak does not want to reroute some of its lines in order to accomodate the stadium. I don't have an opinion just yet, just letting everyone know that there are really two options being discussed right now. Neither of these plans will be put into effect very soon, however, because nobody wants to pay for it :-) 
rec.sport.baseball	 Can anybody figure out why some box score abbreviations make absolutely no sense? (At least in the local Gannett rag that finds its way to my door.) I must have stared at "Cleman" in the Mets' box for a good 30 seconds this morning wondering who the hell it was. Wouldn't it make more sense to use "Colemn"? 
rec.sport.baseball	 One last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and hasn't yet been addressed. I believe the rule also does *not* deal with this situation: 
rec.sport.baseball	 John Lowenstein is definately NOT Jewish. Many in Baltimore thought he was... especially after he told the Baltimore _Jewish Times_ so...but later he admitted that it was a joke. 
rec.sport.baseball	 DUDE! Are you nuts? WFAN is second to none. Jody Mac's exit was quite a loss, but if you think Fredericks On The FAN was much of one, you're pretty skewed. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Since I was born in the late Pleistocene, I too remember 1964. That year, the Dodgers were several games out of first and I think finished sixth in the league. This was kind of odd because they won the World Series both the previous year and the following year. 
rec.sport.baseball	 OK, you guys stirred up my childhood memories, so I went and did some research on the final month or so of the 1964 season. It turns out that my recollections were pretty darn accurate, at least as far as the Phillies record goes. On September 1 1964 this was the top of the N.L. standings: 
rec.sport.baseball	 Just a little something I found while reading the Village Voice, which is not noted for its sports coverage, but occasionally the print some interesting features.

I don't have the article in front of me, so I'll only give the memorable ones here that I remember and know the melody to. I could dig up more if there is interest. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Well, after suffering from an intense fit of Minnesota-induced cabin fever, I've decided to road trip to Milwaukee and take in a couple of games this weekend. A couple games at County stadium will be great to relieve tension, but I thought "Why not go to Wrigley for a game too?" 
rec.sport.baseball	 I would e-mail this to you, but my mailserver doesn't recognize you or something. 
rec.sport.baseball	 So what does that have to do with RBI's? The team with the most RBI's doesn't necessarily win the game. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Maybe I can help you. He's a major league coach with the Rockies. So above prediction is doubly wrong. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I Love it how all of these people are "blaming" the Phillies success on a weak division. Why don't we look at the record of the teams in each division (READ: Inter-Divisional Play), we'll see that the East is really kicking the shit out of the West. I know it is early, but that is all we have to go on. Atlanta is just so strong with their .188 BA, Cincinnati is 2-7 coming off a sweep at Veteran's Stadium in Philadelphia, and Houston was swept in it's first three games by the Phillies in the Astrodome. That, my Western Division friends, shows that the three best teams in your division may not be as strong as you think!! 
rec.sport.baseball	 I have noticed that this year has had a lot of high scoring games (at least the NL has). I believe one reason are the expansion teams. Any thoughts? 
rec.sport.baseball	 For your information, Lankford is injured (I think it is his shoulder or rib cage), so he could not use him as a pinch hitter. 
rec.sport.baseball	 But you still need the pitching staff to hold the opposing team to one run. 
rec.sport.baseball	 You can add Steve Rosenberg, one-time White Sox reliever now in the Mets system, to the list.

rec.sport.baseball	 I don't have a history handy, but I don't recall that the preponderance of ROY's come from winning teams. In fact, I think team performance is generally irrelevant, as almost always the most deserving candidate wins. Am I wrong? 
rec.sport.baseball	 I'm no Kingman fan. Just thought I'd point out that he's the only player in history to have five three-HR games. Joe Carter has four. Eddie Murray three. McCovey and Gehrig also three. Ruth, Mays, Foxx and Dawson two each. 
rec.sport.baseball	 So, if the Braves run production falls to 1 per game, which is certainly where it's headed (if they're lucky), does that mean they'll finish first? 
rec.sport.baseball	 Actually, they're pretty worthless, if you want to evaluate players with stats. RBIs and Runs Scored should be banned; all they do is confuse victims of mediot brainwashing like yourself. 
rec.sport.baseball	 No, he's not nuts, WIP is second to none THE sports station. They don't have Tony Bruno working ESPN radio and Al Morganti doing Friday Night Hockey because they suck. I live in Richmond Va, but I visit Phila often, and on the way I get WTEM Washington) and WIP. I hear the FAN at night wherever I go (the signal used to be WNBC, when they played golden oldies) because you can't avoid it. Of those three, WIP has the best hosts hands down. Chuck Cooperstein isn't a homer, and neither is Jody Mac. WTEM is too generic to be placed in the catergory. In fact if you have heard WTEM and the FAN you notice the theme music is identical...same ownership?? I think so! WIP is totally original. Their hosts actually have a personality (this is a knock at TEM (the TEAM) not the FAN because Mike and the Mad Dog and Sommers are good) I mean comparing the morning guys in Philadelphia to the ones in Washington is a total joke. Anyway, I like the FAN and WIP, but I think the edge goes to 'IP. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Not necessarily. It could mean that, or it could mean that he just hit a lot better at home than he did on the road (see Frank Thomas' home/road splits in '91 for an example). I would guess that some of Alomar's split is due to the Skydome, but most of it is probably due just to coincidence. There's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the Skydome seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and Alomar is not a home run hitter. 
rec.sport.baseball	 What about U. Johnny Hodapp, the greatest 2nd baseman in Cleveland Indians history? 225 hits in 1930, consistantly over .300. A great, great second baseman. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I happen to be a big fan of Jayson Stark. He is a baseball writer for the Philadelphia Inquirer. Every tuesday he writes a "Week in Review" column. He writes about unusual situations that occured during the week. Unusual stats. He has a section called "Kinerisms of the Week" which are stupid lines by Mets brodcaster Ralph Kiner. Every year he has the LGTGAH contest. That stands for "Last guy to get a hit." He also writes for Baseball America. That column is sort of a highlights of "Week in Review." If you can, check his column out sometime. He might make you laugh. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Not really, though I wouldn't personally say "the most deserving candidate wins". Rarely does a player win ROY when called up in mid season, and there have been several duds in recent years. But this is more a factor of mediot biases than anything else. (I wonder. If Amaral hits like he is capable of, will he receive ROTY votes? He's only 31, he could have a long career ahead of him! :-)

rec.sport.baseball	 Tom Prince is a 28 year old no-hit catcher. Think of him as a young Dann Bilardello. I can't begin to fathom why the Pirates have been so afraid of losing this guy, who's been in AAA most of the last 5 seasons. The Pirates released Kirk Gibson last year because Prince was out of options, then eventually sent Prince down anyway, and he cleared waivers without a peep. He's another year older, and still can't hit; why do they think he wouldn't clear waivers now? Why would they care? 
rec.sport.baseball	 While we're on the multipurpose subject, let's not forget Shea, which was designed to accommodate both the Mets & Jets. It was the first stadium (I think) to have the box seats on rollers so they could be oriented at right angles for baseball & in parallel for football.

Incidentally, I just found out that the column has been moved to Sundays. I get my Dad to send it to me up here in Boston every week. Great stuff! 
rec.sport.baseball	 There was an article on Jewish major leaguers in a recent issue of "Elysian Fields", what used to be the "Minnesota Review of Baseball". As I recall, it had an amazing amount of research, with a long list of players and a large bibliography. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Just curious if anyone has started to standout early in the season in the BB DDD this year. I expect the Phillies staff, while getting the wins, would have to rank up there. Luis Gonzalez and Derrick May are among the early league leaders, and all 6 of their bombs have come at the Phils' expense. Neither of them have exactly been know for their tater prowess in the past. 
rec.sport.baseball	 The Royals are darkness. They are the void of our time. When they play, shame descends upon the land like a cold front from Canada. They are a humiliation to all who have lived and all who shall ever live. They are utterly and completely doomed. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Except for the fact that there seems to be a lot of high scoring AL games also and I don't think the expansion teams directly affect them. 
rec.sport.baseball	 A lot of teams carry 3 catchers on their 25 man roster, but the 3rd catcher is seldom ever used. He is only insurance in case of extra innings or the 2nd catcher is injured during a game. So to free up this roster spot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever, why not invoke a catcher re-substitution rule: 
rec.sport.baseball	 Keep in mind this was in Massachussetts. Today was Patriots Day, a state holiday. I think it might be a floating holiday, but given that the Marathon also happens the same day, most people don't go in. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Last week I posted the ALL-TIME GREATEST PLAYERS (and haphazardly misspelled several names--SORRY!) This week, it's time for the greatest PEAK players. I evaluated the following players on 4 consectutive seasons which constituted their "prime" or "peak" years. (3 was too few; 5 seemed to many--so I settled for 4). Sources, as usual, include Total Baseball 1993 and my own (biased) opinions. Here goes, feel free to comment. 
rec.sport.baseball	 We have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris' contribu- tion from the rest of the team's. There is only one way of determin- ing "best" in baseball. And that is by looking at the scoreboard at the end of the game. Each game determines which *team* is the best that day. At the end of the season, the team that was the best the most often is the best in the division. The playoffs determine the best of the best. But the point is that the only decision making pro- cess used to determine the "best" is the score of the game and it re- lates to the *teams*. Not the individual players. There is no method inherent in baseball of comparing individual performances. And that is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I don't | blame players like Galarraga, Dawson and McGee when they swing at | a strike and put the ball in play. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Ah, so you finally found a use for that super slo-mo and frame advance other than scrutinizing "Sorority Babes in Heat". Congrats! 
rec.sport.baseball	 NPR's Morning Edition aired a report this morning (4/19) on Hispanic/Latin American players in MLB and how they have many of the same problems faced by black/negro/African American players when they first entered the league. However, although baseball has adjusted to the presence of black players, many Hispanic players still labor under the stereotype of being "fireballs, hot blooded, flashy". The report also emphasised that despite the rantings (my word) of Jessie Jackson about baseballs discrimination against black players in its upper echelons, baseball has actually done much better by black players than Hispanic players. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Both protests would be denied, of course. The umpire's judgement determines the garbage thing, although I think the game should be called (but that's my personal opinion...doesn't matter). There is time only when the ump says, so the second argument is baseless. 
rec.sport.baseball	 This is true, but the main thing the commish i.e. Selig needs to do is to suspend Bobby Cox. You *cannot* allow a team to come out at the ump as the Braves did. I usually rip umps, but in this case, the players were dead wrong. Cox should go for 5 games. If I had ever umped a game where that happened, I'd have ejected every player that came out. Only Cox and Gant would have been spared, and then Cox would have gone in the ensuing argument. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I suppose a foul ball machine (like Brett Butler) is pretty valuable, but I'd rather watch (and root for) the lower OBP guys who can actually hit the ball. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Not particularly *in* the World Series. During the season, he was probably more valuable than, say, putting Olerud out there to pitch, but yeah, he *was* valuable in getting them there. In the postseason, he sucked dirty canal water through a straw. The Jays won *in spite* of Morris much more than *because of* him. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Well, actually, most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is based on some fantasy of how it happened. But that's OK, I understand you have a hockey background. Stats like "plus/minus" make RBI look good. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Well, had you been a bit less exuberant in both the tone and substance of your predictions, the responses would probably have been a bit more measured. Be that as it may.... 
rec.sport.baseball	 I was wondering if anyone types in the box scores each day. I am at college and am not able to get them till the weekend. I would be thankful if someone could p-mail the Twins box scores every so often. Also I am looking for a Twins 93 schedule. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I had heard the rumors about LA, Cin, Hou, and SD all being interested in Mark Davis, so it doesn't surprise me that a team had to give up something and cash to actually get him. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Is it just me, or does Bichette look totally lost in the outfield? He misplayed Martinez fly-out into a double against the Expos, misplayed Alou's single into a triple (Alou tagged out at 3rd after over-sliding the bag) and now he misplays another out into a 3 run triple...add in his wonderful batting average and we have one heck of a player! 
rec.sport.baseball	 I'm from Dallas, and you have alot of nerve saying that WFAN has a bunch of Hoodlum Mets fans. During the football season, the local cowboy station here had the WIP on several times for simultanious broadcasts. I have never heard a bigger bunch of low intellect, bed wetting ,obnoxious, woofing, cranial deformed, assholes in my entire life! The IQ of the average eagles fan must be in the 10-15 range at best, and they have been known to be big droolers. 
rec.sport.baseball	 That's very true. I live in Richmond, home of the AAA Richmond Braves, and they have this guy Ryan Klesko who hit 17 HR's at home last year. Now that doesn't sound like a whole lot, BUT the way the "Diamond" is built, Home runs are a rarity. In fact, Ron Gant, Brian Hunter and David Justice all proved they could hit in Richmond. When they were sent to the majors, they never came back. If you can hit in Richmond, you can hit anywhere. 
rec.sport.baseball	 But why would you want to use RBI? RBI is an attempt to measure is some combination of clutch hitting and power hitting. If you believe in clutch hitting, then look at how the guy hit with RISP. If you want to see how good of a slugger he is, then look at his slugging average. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I am looking for a source of American League baseball stats for individual players in the same format as printed in newspapers, ie. I do not want to provide a list of players and get back nice printed reports for $35 a week. 
rec.sport.baseball	 The Red Sox usually have 2 catchers. I don't think they have a backup now, but they used to use Randy Kutcher as a backup catcher, as well as a middle infielder and outfielder. You don't need a good 3rd catcher, just a competent one, so you can afford to lose a little catching ability and pick a player who can be of use elsewhere on the field. 
rec.sport.baseball	 its while striking out 5. He was surely the loser tonight. ---Reds starters, while supposedly solid, have won only one game this year. (Of course, the Reds have only won two...) 
rec.sport.baseball	 I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment of WFAN and WIP(I go to school in Philadelphia, and I listen to both stations on a consistant basis.) Now that the fan has Mike Lupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the big name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance He did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he had Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too. Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent: Morning show: In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, and Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti had a better crew of people to work with. To me, WIP tries to copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme. In terms of sports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he interjects humor and politics into his show. 10 AM to 12 Noon: I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their abilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the advantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller who is asking about who the local team is going to draft in the sixth round. Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get better interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless it was a major story. I would consider this even because they are two different styles of host. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I have tickets for the TB Giants and I was wondering if anybody familiar with the stadium could tell me where Section 15 in the lower level is located. Please e-mail the response, Thanks, Rich 
rec.sport.baseball	 I AGREE, LUMBERJACK (except that they're in 2nd)! They ARE going PLACES - San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Cincinnati, Denver, Atlanta, Miami, Philadelphia, New York, Montreal, Pittsburgh, Chicago, St. Louis...and points in between. :-) 
rec.sport.baseball	 Or you may be posting this WAY TOO EARLY and be eating your words by mid-season. C'mon, the Phillies haven't proved anything yet. Atlanta was similar to the Phils 2 years ago. They sucked. They started having a good year, but didn't get any respect until they actually won the division. (which is how it should be) So until the Phils AT LEAST have a good year, not just a good 2 weeks, they won't get any respect either. BTW, Atlanta's .188 BA is actually a compliment to how good the Braves really are. Their record is 6-3. Can you imagine the Phils record if they were batting .188? hahahaha. And Atlanta's hitting will improve dramatically. No, I'm not a Braves fan. Just defending a good team." 'Orin. Bradley U. 
rec.sport.baseball	 As I have read this net the last few days, I am continually amazed at the pronouncements of baseball prowess by many individuals. Especially when it comes down to saying that the Bosox haven't a prayer. As a long time Red Sox fan, I will simply say: The Impossible Dream Year - 1967 for those of you with short memories. short lives, or both. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Off and on over the last several months, threads about RBIs and related topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can predict a player's RBIs using information about his overall performance and the number of runners in scoring position (RISP) that he bats with. In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated predicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs. This completely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2 could do, since context was unknown to it. So I thought I'd take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to the data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Didn't Mike Schmidt also do this at least three times? I can remember twice in Wrigley Field alone...he did it the same day Kong did it in a 23-22 shootout, and he swatted four there one day in April '76 (the month he set the April record with 11 HR's. Anybody remember any of this? (I was just a kid) 
rec.sport.baseball	 I think you can add former A's first baseman Mike Epstein (no relation) to the list. 
rec.sport.baseball	 MLB Standings and Scores for Friday, April 16th, 1993 (including yesterday's games) 
rec.sport.baseball	 Just a few lines about my favorite team sweeping the Dodgers (one of my least favorite) in LA (Sweet!). Also the Mets (my other least favorite team) loss to the Rockies made this this a great day and a great start to the weekend as the Cardinals are on the ESPN tonight. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Also, Alomar got a FAR greater boost from his home park than Baerga did from his. And "six or seven home runs"? Hmm. 
rec.sport.baseball	 This leads me to believe that it's not really a rabbitball year, and that we've just had a rash of high-scoring games. I bet this one day's worth of games pulled everything back to close to average. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Most of the points you made about Lopez v. Berryhill/Olson have been made by others, and realizing that Lopez must be the second coming of Frank Thomas, I have relented and praised the unmistakeable wisdom of his supporters. 
rec.sport.baseball	 The tater that Jack Morris served to Griffey the Younger in his first at-bat this year went 394 feet, if I remember right (I'll have to check my scorecard at home). I think that's the longest so far in the Kingdome through the first stand (five games) there. A weak showing, despite some promising taterball candidates ... Ben McDonald, Rich DeLucia, and the rest of the Mariner bullpen ... making appearances. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I like Alomar. But I'd like to differ with your opinion about "a city which is likely to pour in the votes...". 
rec.sport.baseball	 Bobby Bonilla supposedly use the word 'faggot' when he got mad at that author in the clubhouse. Should he be banned from baseball for a year like Schott? 
rec.sport.baseball	 This was (my opinion) the stupidest thing in the Hidden Game. The argument was 
rec.sport.baseball	 I'd have to say the most impressive HRs I've ever see came from Dave Kingman and his infamous moon-raker drives... 
rec.sport.baseball	 Isn't Stark that idiot who writes in Baseball America? Twice a month he writes a "Who woulda thunk it" article which is really the same piece every time. "Who would have thought that [Buddy Biancalana] would have more home runs than [the Colorado Rockies, Babe Ruth, Omar Vizquel and Nolan Ryan] COMBINED!" He's an idiot, if it's the same guy. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Lowenstein is NOT Jewish. However, there is a long list including Hank Greenberg, Moe Berg, Rod Carew (a convert), the Sherry brothers, Art Shamsky, and Ron Blomberg. 
rec.sport.baseball	 As a Philly fan as as a Penna. baseball fan, I'm anxious to see the Penna. series. Anyone know when it starts and where the first games will be played? 
rec.sport.baseball	 Does anybody else think that WS stats should become part of a player's career stats? Why not? 
rec.sport.baseball	 Once, on Jeopardy, the category was "Jewish Sports Heros," believe it or not. The answer was, "This pitcher had four no-hitters with the Dodgers in the 60s." The contestant said, "Who is Hank Aaron?" Alex Trebek said something like, "I don't think Hank Aaron was a pitcher." 
rec.sport.baseball	 Finally, an objective source. Alomar's a great player, but so is Baerga. Nice to see the objective source cited rather than "my dad's bigger than your dad" posts. 
rec.sport.baseball	 On two separate occasions I saw Dick Allen (back when he was Richie) homer at Shea off the middle of the black centerfield hitter's background screen. I think both shots would have traveled 500 feet. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Well, my question still hasn't been answered: if Spanky was bad enough to release this year, why did he get so much playing time last year? Yes, I know he was part of a platoon, and that's why he got more playing time than Slaught, but that doesn't answer the question. If Slaught was so obviously better this year, wasn't this also obvious last year, and shouldn't he have been taking away some of Spanky's playing time against righties? 
rec.sport.baseball	 When are the Yankees planning on activating Melido Perez? His 15 days on the DL are up today, but are they bringing him back this weekend? 
rec.sport.baseball	 I remember one he hit circa 1976 at Wrigley Field that went across the street (in dead center field) and hit a house on the roof. He whiffed a lot, but when he *did* connect, watch out! 
rec.sport.baseball	 I didn't mean to offend or anything, I'm just quoting Stanky himself on the subject. I remember one time last year he was being interviewed by ESPN, and the interviewer (can't remember who), asked Stanky if he was Jewish because he (the interviewer) was Jewish and wanted to see more Jewish ballplayers. To which Stanky replied, "I'm Polish, not Jewish." 
rec.sport.baseball	 The runner can leave his base at any time. If the ball is caught, he's got to tag up. If it isn't caught, he _doesn't_ have to tag up at all. So, if he's feeling lucky, your runner at second can sprint for glory as soon as the ball is popped up. If it isn't caught, he's probably scored a run. If it is, he's probably headed for AAA. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Well, OBP is the most important offensive statistic, and by a big margin. 50 points of OBP is worth considerably more than 50 points of slugging. That being said, I still think Baerga was VERY SLIGHTLY better last year, but I think this is as close to a wash as you're likely to find. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I saw the replay several times too. No question about it. Daryl missed the ball, *then* the fan caught it. Daryl is so tall that he had the first shot at the ball. Daryl's just whining again. I think it shows a lack of class when Tommy, Daryl and the Dodgers blame a single fan for losing the game. What about the pitcher who threw up the gopher ball? What about the pitchers that gave up 6 runs up to that point? Sorry, Tommy. If it were a 2-1 game and Daryl was 5 feet 2 inches tall, then maybe - just maybe - you'd have an argument. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I've been following the Giants closely over the off-season -- newspapers, notesgroup, etc -- but I had my first up close and personal last night at the Stick. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I'm not sure I understand this question. When the IF rule is invoked, the batter is automatically out. This relieves the runners from being forced to advance to the next base if the ball is not caught. Other than that, isn't it just the same as any situation in which a runner on a base is not forced to the next base on a dropped fly ball? That is, if the ball is caught he can tag up and run (or decide to stay), and if the ball is dropped he can have left the base at any time. 
rec.sport.baseball	 No argument at all with Murphy. He scared the hell out of me when he came in last year. On the other hand, the club though enough of Boever to put him into an awful lot of games (he may have led the league in appearances - he did at least at some point). He seemed to be a very viable setup guy - but I guess that's not considered that crucial by the club. I can just remember two years ago so well, though... 
rec.sport.baseball	 If I remember correctly (Which is always in doubt), Horner's signing with the Braves was contingent on starting in Atlanta. I think he could have gone back to Arizona St. for one more year if he hadn't signed. Anyhow, the Braves did try to send him to Richmond once; it lead to a week-long walkout. Methinks Horner had no work ethic before he was drafted, and minor league play wouldn't have helped. But his raw talent would have gotten him into the ML, and it did keep him there for a while, until he started falling on his wrists. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Al Weiss played second for the White Sox in the early sixties, chiefly as back up to Don Buford. Good glove, no hit, some spunk. 
rec.sport.baseball	 For that matter, how many Gentleman of The Press Box have been Jewish? The only Jewish sportscaster that comes to mind is Steve Williams (?), who had a Phillies show on KYW in Philadelphia in the 80s. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I've been a Giants season ticket holder for years and never really complained about the old ballyard place. Sure, it's been cold, the food lines were long, and the hired hands were surly, but this was all part of the Giants mystique. Or so I thought. 
rec.sport.baseball	 The Chicago Tribune pitching form has Perez pitching today (4/16). But given the way that Buck changes his rotation so often, that could just be the work of a confused stat-page editor. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Would the person who is running the e-mail list for KANSAS CITY Royals please e-mail details regarding mailing list. If you on the list and know the info please send me info as well. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I know. You have this fucked up idea that anybody who prefers Alomar to Baerga must be a Jay-Lover and Indian-Hater. Sorry, you got that one wrong! I hate the Jays and don't care one way or the other about the Indians. But objectively, Alomar had the better offensive year last year, so I have to pick him. 
rec.sport.baseball	 The event that had the most impact on Gaetti's career was his leg injury in 1988. His performance dropped radically from 1988 to 1989. He was still with the Twins in 1989 and 1990, but if you look at his stats (both offensive and defensive), he never has come back to his pre-injury level. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I haven't been following the previous HR's. But there are two, that I saw live that would have to be up there (up where? there!). 1) Rick Monday's HR to bury the Expos in the NL championship in 1981. It was hit off Steve Rogers, who is a RHP and primarily a starter. Why was he used as a reliever when the 'Spos had Reardon and BillLee warming up in the bullpen. Considering Monday couldn't touch LHP, Lee would have been a safe bet. He wasn't even doing any drugs at that time (or so he told me and around 50 others on a recent venture into Montreal. The blast wasn't the important aspect. It was the timing. Seventh game, a tie game, and in the top of the 9th. The Expos almost came back though... 2) Mike Schmidt hit one that killed the Expos in 1980. So close, yet, so far. and 3) Strawberry killed a pitch on the second day of the season a couple of years ago. It went off the technical ring in the Big O. It almost left the stadium! That was hit HARD!!! CorelMARK! 
rec.sport.baseball	 Actually, Gaetti's first year with California was 1991. His .632 DA wasn't out of line with his career averages, and his .616 was actually below average in 1988. But check out the last three years at the Metrodome.

rec.sport.baseball	 Not if you've scored four runs, you don't! Why strain even the best pitching staff? Why not make it easier for them? 
rec.sport.baseball	 Um, the header said *career.* Hodapp managed about 3000 PA in his nine years in the majors. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Not the first. RFK, olim DC Stadium, was built 2 years earlier. Nowadays they don't move the seats back for the few exhibition games; but the 3rd-base/LF lower deck used to move. It was all metal, which was pretty noisy on Bat Day. 
rec.sport.baseball	 Did he ever really convert? He married a Jewish woman, but I've never heard him say he converted. Elliot Maddox, on the other hand... 
rec.sport.baseball	 Right. So who cares which PLAYER gets credited, as long as the TEAM gets more runs? If a player helps the TEAM get more R and RBI, but doesn't score them all himself, who cares? 
rec.sport.baseball	 I have lived in the Boston area for 15 years now. They have been talking about a new Boston Garden (hockey/basketball) since I've lived here. One day the "last hurdle" has been overcome, and the next day there's a new hurdle. Fans have been grumbling about Foxboro Stadium (or whatever it's called this year) for nearly as long, but there are only preliminary proposals for a new stadium. Local politics prevents anything from being done in a timely fashion. There will not be a new ballpark in my lifetime.

rec.sport.baseball	 The Giants always hit Maddux well, but it was interesting that Maddux did not pitch around Bonds to get to Clayton last night. He threw 2 straight fastballs over the plate to Bonds in the 1st last night, got away with the first one, but Bonds hit the second one out of the park. Then in the 3rd, when Clark was at third base with one out, Maddux did not intentionally walk Bonds, and Bonds dropped a single to left-center.

rec.sport.baseball	 Wasn't Ron Bloomberg, the former Yankee who got the first base hit by a Designated Hitter, Jewish?? 
rec.sport.baseball	 Oh... I forgot... Art Shamsky, former Red and Mets player. Batted .301 between injuries in 1969 (fell short of qualifying for Top 10 because of injuries and platoon with Ron Swoboda; no Swobo wasn't Jewish). 
rec.sport.baseball	 All they said on the radio that he developed stiffness in the shoulder after throwing a curveball that didn't loosen. Because of the cold night in Denver they decided to remove him from the game rather than let him pitch. He is expected to pitch his next turn in the rotation (expected to be April 20, at Shea vs the Giants). 
rec.sport.baseball	 the best home run i have *ever* seen came off, believe it or not, Roger Clemens (sorry, Val) a couple of years ago. he threw a ball to Incaviglia which was literally at Inky's neck, and he absolutely hammered the crap out of it. after the swing, Clemens nonchalantly motioned for a new ball--he didn't even turn around to look, or even get upset. the ball hit the lights in the left-field standard, some 70 or so feet about the Green Monster (over 100 feet above the ground total!)

No other business could ever get away with the 19th century attitudes that most current owners display in running their clubs.

Baylor said after Wednesday's game that he wanted to shake up the lineup a little, because Bichette has been having a rough time defensively and Jerald Clark has not been hitting. He was true to his word; I went to Thursday's game and Gerald Young was in right and Daryl Boston (who has a very hot bat) was in left. Baylor was careful to say though that he didn't necessarily mean for these changes to be permanent but he wanted to give these other two a shot while Clark and Bichette were not playing well. 
rec.sport.baseball	 I heard that Eli is selling the team to a group in Cinninati. This would help so that the O's could make some real free agent signings in the offseason. Training Camp reports that everything is pretty positive right now. The backup catcher postion will be a showdown between Tackett and Parent although I would prefer Parent. #1 Draft Pick Jeff Hammonds may be coming up faster in the O's hierarchy of the minors faster than expected. Mike Flanagan is trying for another comeback. Big Ben is being defended by coaches saying that while the homers given up were an awful lot, most came in the beginning of the season and he really improved the second half. This may be Ben's year. I feel that while this may not be Mussina's Cy Young year, he will be able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last year around August. I really hope Baines can provide the RF support the O's need. Orsulak was decent but I had hoped that Chito Martinez could learn defense better and play like he did in '91. The O's right now don't have many left-handed hitters. Anderson proving last year was no fluke and Cal's return to his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant. The rotation should be Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, ?????. Olson is an interesting case. Will he strike out the side or load the bases and then get three pop outs? You never know. The way I see the AL East this year (with personal biases mixed in) Baltimore New York Toronto Milwaukee Cleveland Boston Detroit (The top 4 are the only true contenders in my mind. One of these 4 will definitely win the division unless it snows in Hell/Maryland :). I feel that this Baltimore's season to finally put everything together.) __________________________________________________________________________ |Admiral Steve C.

rec.sport.baseball	 Hello, my friends and I are running the Homewood Fantasy Baseball League (pure fantasy baseball teams). Unfortunely, we are running the league using Earl Weaver Baseball II with the Comm. Disk II and we need the stats for the 1992 season. (Preferably the 1992 Major League Stat Disk) We have the '92 total stats but EWB2 needs the split stats otherwise we have 200 inning games because the Comm. Disk turns total stats into vs. L's stats unless you know both right and left -handed stats. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against Winnipeg with Selanne on the ice can be blamed on him...Roger, he is a FORWARD. Winnipeg has a lousy defensive record anyway. Let's put it another way. John Cullen's +/- is terrible. What's your excuse for him? That his powerplay points don't count? Neither do Selanne's... 
rec.sport.hockey	 I can only comment on the Kings, but the most obvious candidate for pleasant surprise is Alex Zhitnik. He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, but he's clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish he were more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away that huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he's only a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, though not through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, the award goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily be MVP, but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the league's premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the rest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer goals than Hartford. Honorable mentions to Majestic Marty and Warren Rychel. Jon 
rec.sport.hockey	 I would have chosen Alex Zhitnik for biggest suprise. They did expect that he would become a great defenseman, but I don't think anyone knew that he was going to be this impressive in his rookie year. His speed, skating ability, and puck control is exceptional -- he is the one to watch on the Kings. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Cool. They sound like a cult classic. Can someone post a address or phone # of a store that sells these? 
rec.sport.hockey	 Last night during a Sharks' broadcast, Commissioner Bettman was interviewed during the first intermission. He made no bones about it, the expansion to 28 is on permanent hold until he is satisfied that the current allotment of 26 are fully stable. This means that cities looking for a club in the foreseeable future will have to wait until one team in some location fails or looks to relocate.

rec.sport.hockey	 First of all, the Penguins WILL win the cup again. Who is going to stop them? Definitely not the Canucks! 
rec.sport.hockey	 says: The precedent was set by the WHA in their first season. They used a red puck for exhibition games and a blue one for the regular season. Thankfully, they abandoned it in favour of black before the next season began. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Yup. Then again, there are lots of foreign-born players on the Canadian national soccer team so the Brits give something back to you in the end:-) 
rec.sport.hockey	 Well, Druce pretty much sucked when he was with the Caps. He had one good **playoffs** (not season). oh well. The Caps are notorious for making stupid trades anyway, as can be seen with the Cicarelli and Hrivnak trades. Sigh. In another note... I'd have to say the Caps biggest surprise was Cote, as many Caps fans had been expecting a lot from Bondra already. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Hi. According to my always questionable newspaper, there's a silver dollar being minted in Canada, the back of which commemorates the anniversary of the Stanley Cup. Now, I know full well what coins are used every day in Canada. I can easily fish a few out of my pocket change right now, in fact. My question is, since the loon is the only dollar coin that I know is legal tender, is this just a commemorative coin with no monetary exchange value, or what? Is it the sort of thing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet, with no chance of it being circulated? If it is an uncirculated coin, what's the current cost and what's its potential value? Just curious. If no one knows, I'll take this to soc.culture.canada and rec.collecting (or whatever it is). Thanks again 
rec.sport.hockey	 I disagree. McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the crowds whether or not the team is expected to do well. Very few fans real- istically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they still go out to see Gretzky. This is the marketing strategy - selling the game by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the NBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is bringing to the league. They have gone on record as stating that they are trying to sell the game on its stars. Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect examples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, being benificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals that would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to attract, that these players are indeed superstars. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Here we go again. Is this the same idiot who posted the Gretzky trade to Toronto???? Sheeeesh! You should have waited until we got over that one before this garbage, maybe we would have believed it for half a second (NOT!). 
rec.sport.hockey	 Are you comparing Cullen to Salami? I would say that that is valid. If Winnipeg is such a lousy defensive team then why the hell does Salami stand around the other team's blueline when the puck is in his own end? 
rec.sport.hockey	 Agreed here...I'll never forget Dan Kelly calling the play-by-play in the '87 Canada Cup. He was masterful! 
rec.sport.hockey	 I was thinking about who on each of the teams were the MVPs, biggest surprises, and biggest disappointments this year. Now, these are just my observations and are admittedly lacking because I have not had an opportunity to see all the teams the same amount. Anyway.... 
rec.sport.hockey	 weren't these two" 'traded for each other? Poetic justice. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I've had, and still have a few aluminum sticks. I got my first when I was 15 (a Christian), and broke the shaft halfway through the season, two years later. I bought another (a Canadian) at the beginning of the next season, and I still have it. I also have an Easton, that a friend was getting rid off, after giving up the game. I find that Easton blades are easier to get, but all brands of blades are pretty well interchangeable. Watch out for dried up bits of firewood, that some stores pass off as blades. In my experiences, the blades of an aluminum break more often than regular sticks, but I've only ever broken one aluminum shaft. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Well, since the Oilers didn't win a heck of a lot of games, I'm not sure they deserve and MVP ("can't win without him"). However, I'd suggest Kelly Buchberger instead of Dave Manson, who has had a brutal year, his pick for the All-Star game notwithstanding. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Actually, this part was really interesting. It turns out that the mask is custom-fit to the goalie's face. The goalie puts his/her face through a piece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face and forehead to show. Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic wrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face. Then, a plaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12 minutes to dry sufficiently. When it dries, it is effectively a mold of the goalie's face. This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves padding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc. John Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show. 
rec.sport.hockey	 More like Philadelphia making dust out of dead Leafs. Roger why do you continue to embarass yourself with your brash predictions? 
rec.sport.hockey	 Before I begin lambasting Don Cherry, let me first say that I've been sort of a Cherry fan for a while...admittedly stuff he says has to be taken lightly, but he's more-or-less harmless. On Saturday, however, he crossed the lines of good taste: 
rec.sport.hockey	 TSN Sportsdesk just reported that the OTTAWA SUN has reported that Montreal will send 4 players + $15 million including Vin Damphousse and Brian Bellows to Phillidelphia, Phillie will send Eric Lindros to Ottawa, and Ottawa will give it's first round pick to Montreal. 
rec.sport.hockey	 To put it mildly. As I watched the Flyers demolish Toronto last night, 4-0, I realized that no matter how good the Leafs' #1 line may be, they'll need one or two more decent lines to go far in the playoffs. And, of course, a healthy Felix Potvin. 
rec.sport.hockey	 They were, and even if Washington might consider Patty a bust, I'd rework that trade in a minute. Druce has been a complete and utter bust here, only 5 goals. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Did you ever notice how many people on the net have trouble in the comparitively easy task of spelling the nick name of our fair city? I never knew that Philadelphia becomes Phillie or Philli when spoken of. So for all you who don't know yet here's a _little_ clue. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Pierre, For purposes of the tie breaker, you only count the first three games in each city. Therefore, Quebec cannot possibly be ahead of Montreal 4-3, and there's probably only one game that counts remaining between Boston and Quebec, which means Boston has probably already won. 
rec.sport.hockey	 With the kind of team Montreal has now, they can take the cup easily. The only problem they have right now is that everyone is trying to steal the show and play alone. They need some massive teamwork. They are also in a little of a slump because long-time hockey Montreal Canadiens announcer Claude Mouton died last tuesday and it was rough on everybody because he has worked with the organization for 21 years. But I know that is no excuse. But if the Habs manage to get some good teamwork and get into the spirit, they should have no problem winning in May. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I agree. I also think Roy needs a good kick sometimes...that horrible 4-0 loss to the Capitals last week...yeeeech! 
rec.sport.hockey	 Ten years ago, the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarter of what it is now. Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on NHL teams have escalated to the following stats: 
rec.sport.hockey	 Obviously some reporter for the Ottawa Sun got taken by an April Fools joke...probably started by someone with the Nordiques or the Bruins. 
rec.sport.hockey	 According to what reasonable principle of justice does standing in intimate geographical and psychological relations to a league give one some privileged right to play in it? 
rec.sport.hockey	 I have to agree here. As I heard on TSN tonight, "You want to pick someone else, but you just don't see how you can". And I'm a Bruins fan. Maybe this year will be different, but it doesn't look good. Time will tell, though. 
rec.sport.hockey	 If anybody is having problems following the thread be sure to ask the origonal poster to rectify your misunderstanding. 
rec.sport.hockey	 This is known as the Savard syndrome - and we are talking Denis, not Serge. No team will ever win squat with the likes of Denis Savard in their lineup. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Listen, *ASSHOLE*, I'm just commenting on what I heard reported on the sports news!! 
rec.sport.hockey	 You know, you're absolutely right. I think we should round up all those players of European descent and ship 'em back to where they came from. Let's see, with whom should we start? I dunno, Lemieux? Hmmm...sounds like he has *French* blood in him!!! Hey! France is part of Europe! Send that Euro-blooded boy back!!! 
rec.sport.hockey	 RA Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. R I am sick of watching a game between an American and a Canadian RA team (let's say, the Red Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names R like "Bure" "Konstantinov" and "Borshevshky". Is this North America RA isn't it? 
rec.sport.hockey	 It's bad jokes like that which draws crohns, I mean groans from the crowd... Don't bother looking it up in the appendix, it's useless anyway. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Ah, so now we're into European player bashing? What next? No more French Canadiens? Yeah, there's an idea! Let them French- speaking Canadiens have their own hockey league! We don't want them! Are you _CRAZY_? The NHL is one of the true international leagues, and yes, there _ARE_ many Europeans who deserve to play in the NHL and are better than some North Americans, look at Teemu!!! I, for one, am glad to see Europeans in the NHL and I hope the NHL soon expands to Europe. Its nice to see all these different people come together to form the (soon to be) 26 hockey teams. 
rec.sport.hockey	 At the Lester Patrick Awards lunch, Bill Torrey mentioned that one of his options next season is to be president of the Miami team, with Bob Clarke working for him. At the same dinner, Clarke said that his worst mistake in Philadelphia was letting Mike Keenan go -- in retrospect, almost all players came realize that Keenan knew what it took to win. Rumours are now circulating that Keenan will be back with the Flyers. 
rec.sport.hockey	 even show the final game of the Stanley Cup laast year while it was happening. They put it on ktape delay and cut the intermissions then went off the air. When you move you take the good with the bad and deal with it; it doesn't mean thaat you can't complain about it. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Does anyone have the addresses to any of the following hockey teams located in the Czech/Slovak Republics, Finland, Russia or Sweden? Any information on how to find these addresses would also be appreciated. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I *loved* Dan Kelly! He was on USA when I first got hooked on Hockey back in 1980 or so. No, he wasn't always spot on top of the play, and he wasn't overly cute, but those pipes! That lusty, barrel chested, voice! No pipsqueak was he (unlike some fellas we know!) 
rec.sport.hockey	 I'll have to disagree with you on this one. I think Vancouver will go as Bure goes, and if he continues on his goal scoring slump, then they won't even make it out of the first round. I think the Kings will make it out of the first round, regardless of who they play. They seem to be doing pretty well, even with that bad game against Minnesota on Saturday. I think it'll be either Calgary or Los Angeles to win the Smythe (i.e. go on to the conference finals). 
rec.sport.hockey	 That's why we have expansion - to create more jobs. NHL teams can't afford to import role players from Europe, they pick the stars but will continue to build their teams around local players. 
rec.sport.hockey	 The FLYERS team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the Spectrum Sunday night, and dominated the Maple Leafs thoroughly en route to a 4-0 shutout. Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely broke a sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from mounting any serious attack. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I thought that he was comparing Cullen to TEEMU SEL[NNE. I always thought that salami is some sort of sausage, BUT IF YOU, dear Roger, ARE ABLE TO SEE SALAMI ON THE ICE PLAYING HOCKEY... I don't know what to do, but you surely should do something and very quickly!!! 
rec.sport.hockey	 Well, here it is, NHL in the year 2000. I got these from a very reliable source in a dream some years ago and although I initially thought I had just been taking too many too strong drugs now it seems the realization has really begun... You can see the league has already started to move to this direction. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Speaking of spelling errors on the Cup, I wonder if the "h" in Pittsburgh made it to the Cup. You know how funny people can be about spelling Pittsburgh. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Could anyone recommend a mail order distributor for hockey equipment. 
rec.sport.hockey	 From where I come from in Canada, Borshevsky sounds more Canadian than Smith! -) 
rec.sport.hockey	 Don't you Americans study history...the French settled in North America as early or before the British...Lemieux can probably trace back his North American heritage back a lot further than most of us.

rec.sport.hockey	 I've been watching & playing hockey for a good long time now, and I've seen players with questionable tactics, but never have I seen what Ray did on Sunday. This guy gets my all time loser award. It's one thing to repeatedly cross check someone to the back of the neck when they are down, it's another thing to have a fist fight with someones balls. Ray should be thrown out of the league, what an a**hole. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Here are the standings after the April 6 update. I'll be leaving for Japan in 1.5 hours, and I won't be back until April 17.

rec.sport.hockey	 As I've mentioned in the rules posting, I will be out of town until the day before the entry deadline, so I won't be able to respond to your messages until April 18. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I was playing this golf game and something interesting happened. On the 7th hole, I drove the ball down the fairway, when the ball was in mid-flight, the game completely froze. A couple seconds later, the screen went completely black, with an error message in large "Bubble" letters that said DIVISION BY ZERO. I thought it was funny considering I am a computer programmer, and I had never seen an error like this on an actual video game system like Sega or Nintendo (or even Atari or Intellevision years ago). Oh yeah, after the message, there was also what must have been an address, in hexadecimal. I forget the exact hex code that was given. HAS THIS HAPPENED TO ANYONE ELSE??? It must have, my game shouldn't have been the only one to do this. 
rec.sport.hockey	 On the Lindros "trade": Like Ottawa would be stupid enough to get Lindros. Why do you think Quebec traded him? Lindros would go on personal strike again...maybe I should talk to Ottawa mgmt. about arranging such a trade.... ;-) 
rec.sport.hockey	 I've never seen a game where one player has committed 5 penalties. Something like this would require more attention by the referee. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I think that NHLPA' 93 is the best video game available now. of course many things could be done better, but i really appreciate that the names of players are the real ones, no matter if it lacks some logos... I am still playing it since November leading different teams to the finals and making scorers from the same team compete for the top scoring: Yesterday I won the title using Toronto against Hartford (4 games to two), I played the playoffs in a 7 games fashion (5 minutes for each period) and the best scorer and shooter was Gilmour (116 shots if I remember well) 
rec.sport.hockey	 Please. Have a care with Phil. We liked him a lot in Pittsburgh. He didn't score a lot if you look at his stats last year but he worked his butt off. It was his speed that created opportunities in the offensive zone that allowed the Pens to utilize his potential. I haven't been paying attention to him this year so I can't say I know what you're objecting to. He has been out with injuries though, hasn't he? And if the offense isn't there, there's not much his speed will do for you. Like I said, he created opportunities but he didn't score much. I thought the money offered from the Rangers was a little high, and so did the Pens, I guess. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Major league baseball has told the Blue Jays and the Expos not to sign Oscar Linares (I think that is his name) ...Canada does not have the restrictions against Cubans that the US has and other major league teams have told the Canadian teams that they would be very unhappy if the Expos or the Blue Jays would do this. Cubans players would not have to defect to play in Canada and could play the 81 home games for the Expos and Blue Jays without any trouble. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Kovalev is too talented a player to play for Roger Nielson...Roger needs players who can't think for themselves and can only skate in straight lines up and down the ice. Dudley and Nielson are the only two coaches bad enough in the league to take talents like Mogilny and Kovalev and not know how to turn them into Bure and Selanne. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Linares has not defected; as I pointed out, MLB requires that the player defect first. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Sheesh. The rumor mill strikes again. But let's just assume this were true. My question is this: 
rec.sport.hockey	 These new rule changes are great! However, I think that your rules are MUCH too complicated. How will the normal average fan be able to count how many fouls a player has? And then we would even have to remember the names of the players, in order to determine who drew the foul! And, of course, there will have to be new "sub-positions", like the power center who just sits in the slot until the (blue, of course) puck comes near him, and the "shooting defenseman" and the "point defenseman". Finally, we'll be able to keep stats on the best and the worst penalty-shot takers. Since almost everyone on the ice will be getting fouled, we'll be able to see Ulf Samuellson (sp?) and Tie Domi miss penalty shots like crazy. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I agree, with Marty McSorely and Warren Rychel running a close second and third. I am surprised more people have not noted Knickle as the biggest surprise, even though I personally do not really rate him well. The biggest disappointment has to be Carson. Though this is really unfair, since too much was expected of him. The second biggest disappointment is Melrose, with his adolescent handling of the goaltending problems. Putting Hrudey on the bench for a month is just stupid. It did not contribute to the team coming out of its slump. MVP is surely Robitaille. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Mr. BettmantThe Guy in the Wrong Sport Mr. SteintThe Guy Who Should Be In Charge But Isn't 
rec.sport.hockey	 Heard last night that Paul Kuryia will be playing for the Canadian World Hockey team this year. He was on a local radio station when a friend of the familty called to congratulate him on the invitation. Meekly Paul told the host that he didn't think they wanted it out yet. This morning I heard that he is destined to play on a line with Lindros and Recci{unsure of this one}. If he plays well in this arena, he could go #1 or 2 in the draft. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Ok, but have you seen Tabaracci play yet? In his two starts and his relief effort for Beaupre, he has looked mighty sharp - don't forget the shutout. I think he's let in just four goals over eight periods of play. I like Hrivnak, but we might actually have to give some credit to David Poile for a change after this trade. 
rec.sport.hockey	 For those Leaf fans who are concerned, the following players are slated for return on Thursday's Winnipeg-Toronto game :" 'Peter Zezel, John Cullen 
rec.sport.hockey	 The r.s.h FAQ sheet never fails to crash my newsreader. The only way I can avoid crashing (and restarting the machine) is to look at the headers and avoid reading the FAQ. Does anyone else have problems reading the FAQ? 
rec.sport.hockey	 If life were so simple! Savard has not played in three of the last four games and they are still playing like crap. Montreal's problems run deeper than Savard (and Mouton) unfortunately; I hope they can get their act together before the playoffs. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Gee, you'd think Winnipeg would be tops on that list, what with 8 regulars being European. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Don't you Canadians understand sarcasm? Sometimes the reader must decide that what he's reading is so ludicrous that it must mean the opposite of what it said... 
rec.sport.hockey	 MLB is perfectly willing to take players from Cuba. They just have to defect first. 
rec.sport.hockey	 This brings up a question I asked myself (no answer) when it was mentionned that the NHL could expand in Europe. 
rec.sport.hockey	 NO NO NO! since all the penalties fall into three classes, there should only be three penalties: 
rec.sport.hockey	 I'm not sure about Juha, but another top center, Rauli Raitanen([ss{t) is drafted by Jets. Raitanen had very good year and he has played in the Finnish nationalteam. I believe that he'll be one of the best finns in this year's WC, if Matikainen(Head coach) elects him to the team. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I saw a previous request for the Rules and Instructions for the USENET playoff pool but I haven't seen any responce. Does anybody have this info? If so post away or you could mail it to me. Thanks in advance. 
rec.sport.hockey	 That's true, but according to your stats, Chicago has just as good a record as Toronto. It's interesting that you should list Toronto ahead of Chicago. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Just Testing !!! No flames please ! 
rec.sport.hockey	 You're right ... I'm sick of seeing all those white guys on skates myself ... the Vancouver Canucks should be half women, and overall one-third Oriental. 
rec.sport.hockey	 After watching the Pengiuns all year (and as many other teams as possible), I've really noticed an increase in Tom Barasso's cheap shots this year (and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other goaltenders). I've also noticed that he usually gets away with it. Just as examples last night, I noticed him elbowing Scott Stevens in the head, which basically started the whole shoving match that got Stevens (Scott) and Tocchet 2 minute minors. He also KICKED John McLean. Of course he wasn't called for that. Isn't kicking an automatic match penalty and 10 game suspension? I think Glenn Anderson got one a few years ago for kicking Gaetan Duchesne in the chest. There's no doubt in my mind that Barasso is the dirtiest golatender since Hextall. He's also very good. 
rec.sport.hockey	 from Anna Matyas: Now if we could just clone Chelios's personality and transplant it into all of the defensemen on the Islanders, Capitals, and Devils... 
rec.sport.hockey	 I agree with Rick that Ulf's cross check wasn't illegal. It was the kind of check you see a dozen times during a game without being called. Slo-mos sometimes have a tendency to make things look worse than they really are. Besides, if Messier can't take the heat, he should stay out of the kitchen. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Well, the Patrick Division got a little more interesting last night. The Islanders lost in OT and the Devils tied the Pens. That means if the Isles beat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Markus had a good season in MoDo in the Swedish elite league, scoring 22 goals, 17 assists, 39 points and 67 PIM in 39 games. 
rec.sport.hockey	 DEG has many german-born forwards in the team. In fact the majority of players are german-born. 1992-93 DEG had 11150 average in 11800 spectator arena. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Well, if things were different and I had my way, the headline would be: "NHL, European Division regular season game: Stockholm Storm vs. Helsinki Tornado 4-3..." Two games against every North American-based team (46 in all), and this might have been the ninth and final regular season encounter between Helsinki and Stockholm. The remaining 27 games would involve Paris, Dortmund, Milan... A nice dream.

rec.sport.hockey	 Well, it seems that the Habs have been much talked-about of late, so here's my $0.02. These guys have absolutely no concept of how to play in front of the damn net!!! Watch them in the offensive zone, especially on the powerplay. Damphousse or Lebeau will skate all over the bloody zone, maybe pass to the point, get it back, skate some more, pass it around....BUT WHERE'S THE SHOT??! Answer: the shot is totally useless because they lack a forward who stands in front of the net a la` Neely, Shanahan, Tocchet, etc etc. Too bad Demers won't put Dipietro or LeClair on the powerplay more often. Dammit, even Ewen would at least cause some disruptions. Montreal desperately needs a power forward with some talent, IMO.

rec.sport.hockey	 Just a quick note about Manon's immediate future: Rumor has it(USA Today's spor ts page) that she will be playing with Tampa Bay's affiliate in the ECHL(I Thin k. It's been a couple of days. :)) She will supposedly be competing for the num ber 2 goaltender spot. I think, after her performance, which was damn good for someone who hasn't played squat all year, that we'll be seeing a lot more of h er in Atlanta in the years to come. 
rec.sport.hockey	 There is really nothing inherently wrong with it but they tried it just a little over a decade ago, and noone showed up for the early rounds in the playoffs...whereas soon after they went to the divisional set-up arenas were mostly filled in the early rounds. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Pocklington just wanted to wake up the powers that be holding political office, in Northlands, and in the business community that the Oilers with their current lease arrangement are in a state where on a yearly basis they will likely have an operating loss based on "normal" hockey revenues and expenses. That he did this was a good thing...it is better he complain early, and make the city aware of a potential looming crisis before he begins to lose millions and millions of dollars...which would truly jeopardize the franchise. 
rec.sport.hockey	 What?! White, yes. Well off, definitely not. Hockey season ticket owners have the lowest average income of any of the four major North American sports. 
rec.sport.hockey	 You might want to clarify the 11 game winning streak. That Pens streak is a PLAYOFF streak (tied by the Chicago Blackhawks, who had won 11 in a row until they met the Pens in the finals last year) The 18 game unbeaten, so far, is a regular season unbeaten streak. But hey, don't take it personally. I'm a Flyers fan and two in a row is a stretch. But with a healthy Lindros, Recchi, Brind'amour and Tommy Soderstrom, they'll be there next year! By the way, since the Flyers need defenseman, what kind of trade would anybody suggest from the existing Flyers roster since the scuttlebutt is that 
rec.sport.hockey	 The French Canadian rule was an extremely short term feature when the universal draft was instituted in the sixties and only lasted for a few years...and really didn't have any substantial effect during that period. The Canadiens Stanley Cup achievements were earned on a level playing field. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I'm starting an informal poll on goalie masks. I'd like to know who's mask you think looks the best. I've always like Curtis Joseph's of the Blues the best. Anyway, send your nominations to me, or post your vote here on r.s.h. My e-mail adress is: gtd597a@prism.gatech.edu 
rec.sport.hockey	 That is what my point really was. There is not straight dependency between the +/- and scored points. Apparently most of the netters have realized it by themselves. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Well now that the hawks have won the division the road is a little easier for the playoffs. Let toronto and detroit beat the hell out of each other while Chicago sweeps st.louis. That just makes it easier in the second round with all the rest they will get and tor/det getting none. For the conf. champ they will have a hard time versus the division but that div. will be pretty battered also so the advantage goes to the Hawks again. Then bring pitt. and sure the Hawks will probably lose but its better to get that far and lose than to not go. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Nice try Deepak, but "tough Whaler squad" should have clued you in to the fact that my Leaf woofing was tongue-in-cheek. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Not bad, you only got 2 wrong,... Cal over Chi in 5 and Cal over Pit in 6 (or 7) to take the SC 
rec.sport.hockey	 First, I enjoyed reading your post. Second, I disagree with the Pen's weak spot being defense and goaltending - for a couple of reasons. Barrasso has had a spectacular year - no slow start, consistently sharp, GAA < 3.0, and leads the league in wins. Tommy deserves the Vezina. Given the lack of respect he commands, though, I doubt he will win it. The other reason concerns the Pens' team defense. They are hovering around 3rd or 4th in the fewest goals allowed. That is a big improvement for them, and it indicates that they are playing better team defense. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I'd personally prefer Buffalo-Boston, as a birthday gift from ESPN, but I don't think the folks at ESPN will accomodate that for me ;-) ESPN has this inexplicable affinity for the Patrick division, it seems. 
rec.sport.hockey	 He's not gone yet. The position opening is down to Polie and the Sabres' GM Gerry Meehan. I think I'd like to see Meehan gone... 
rec.sport.hockey	 The Selke candidate forwards main purpose on a shift is to prevent goals from being scored- not to score them. When Lemieux or Gilmour play their number one purpose is to score- defence is secondary- especially considering the line that plays against them is probably a defensive one. That is why they are not Selke candidates. 
rec.sport.hockey	 IMO any good player should score on power plays because of the man advantage. Very good power play scorers tend to become overrated because their point totals are inflated by power play points. +/- tends to expose these overrated players such as Brett Hull, John Cullen and Dave Andreychuck. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Question: If a team uses 40 players in a season do you merely divide the total +/- by 40? If so, a player who plays in only 1 game is considered equally valuable as a player who plays in all of them. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Derian Hatcher's game-misconduct penalty was rescinded by the NHL, allowing the Minnesota defenseman to play in the North Stars' last two regular-season games. Hatcher was given the penalty during a fight at the end of a loss at St. Louis on Sunday, April 11. But the league didn't rescind the game-misconduct penalty Shane Churla received. The Stars recalled center Cal McGowan from their top minor league club in Kalamazoo, Mich., to replace Churla. 
rec.sport.hockey	 It is no matter what you call the teams, Jokerit and TPS, or Helsinki Tornado and Turku Typhoon, the best palyers in Finland would eventually end up in those teams anyway, if they were in the "big" league. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Everybody. Please send me your predictions for the Stanley Cup Playoffs! I want to see who people think will win.!!!!!!! 
rec.sport.hockey	 The Hawks won the Norris div, and sealed their fate. It's bad luck to win the Norris. The Hawks will sweep the Blues in their dreams but will lose in 6 in reality. I predict that in the 6 game with the Blues Belfour will go down on his knees 7000 time s and will spend the rest of the time looking behind him self. Butcher will pound Roenick and The warthawks have no one tough enough to prevent it 
rec.sport.hockey	 I watched him over his entire career. I have NEVER seen a player, and that includes Russell Courtnall and Davie Keon, screw up as many breakaways as Bob Gainey. And I will never forget the time Denis Potvin caught Gainey with his head down. You have been sold a bill of goods on Bob Gainey. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I was at a Cincinnati Cyclones game a year ago when the local country station sponsored a kazoo giveaway. After a particularly bad call by the underexperienced ECHL ref, it was Kazoostorm time down on the ice. I thought this was a pathetic display by the fans, but they were rightfully unhappy. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Well, suffice to say that it is a sport for those able to make the substantial investment in equipment, etc. But here's something, do you think that the availability of in-line skates and road hockey could contribute to a rise in awareness of ice hockey? I would argue this is having an effect here. Kids play ice hockey in the winter and road hockey in the summer with in-line skates. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Wrong information. They just announced that Suhonen has made a deal with Jokerit. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Well, I don't recall assuming anything, except perhaps that the columnist who reported the incident was telling the truth i.e. the sarcastic impression came from _him_ (Steve Simmons?). Besides, to my knowledge Alex has a pretty fair grasp of the English language...and his recent comment after the Detroit game would indicate that this remark _is_ what I think it to be. Very low. 
rec.sport.hockey	 These players all are pretty good players. They are the depth that the dynasties had to win Stanley Cups. They tend to be the very good second line guys- who would be first liners on most weaker clubs in the NHL. They were all important to their clubs. Probably, several of these Stanley Cup winning teams would not have won the cups they did if it were not for the depth provided by these players. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Here is an update on the Goalie mask poll... First, since so many people gave me their 3 best, I decided to give 3 pts for their favorite, 2 pts for 2nd, 1 for 3rd. If you e-mailed a response with only one, I gave it 3 pts. Please feel free to send me your 2 other favorites, if you only sent one before. Also, votes are still welcome! Any mask you like will do, as I have received votes for players not in the NHL. Please mention what team they play for, though. So here are the up-to-date results so far: 
rec.sport.hockey	 Yes, but as has been mentioned many times before, the Islanders play at the talent level of their opponent. Since Hartford is pitiful, the Islanders played pitiful. Since Pittsburgh is great, the Isles will most likely play great. This is most likely due to inexperience and very poor shooting. To Greg: yes, I have noticed that the Islanders couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with the puck if they were two feet in front of it. Does anyone have shooting percentages? I don't know if that would help, since they often miss the net completely, but it might shed some light on the subject. 
rec.sport.hockey	 My vote goes to John Vanbiesbrouck. His mask has a skyline of New York City, and on the sides there are a bunch of bees (Beezer). It looks really sharp. 
rec.sport.hockey	 According to THE FAN here in T.O., Ottawa has won the Daigle e sweepstakes. They didn't mention why, but San Jose had more goals than the Sen-sens, so I have a hunch this is why Ottawa would pick first..... 
rec.sport.hockey	 There was an article in one of the Toronto papers about this a few months ago...probably the Globe and Mail... 
rec.sport.hockey	 It's just as meaningless to compare goals, assists, PIM and any other stat I can think of. Each player is asked to take a unique role for his team. The contexts will never be the same from one player to another playing on the same team or different teams. And yet ... awards are given and promotions received based in part on these meaningless stats. The operative words are "in part" - stats must be interpreted, tempered with other information one has about the player. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Well, since someone probably wanted to know, here's this year's playoff matchups on the left, and what the matchups would be next year under the new alignment and playoff-matchup rules. The same 16 teams make the playoffs under next year's rules, and three of the first round matchups are the same (QUE-MTL, CHI-STL, VAN-WIN). 
rec.sport.hockey	 The FLYERS closed out the season last night with their 8th straight victory, a 5-4 OT winner over the Hartford Whalers. The OT game winner came from Dimitri Yushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS never led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an NHL record 9th OT loss this season. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Here is yet another prediction for them great playoffs! (you may laugh at your convenience!) :)

rec.sport.hockey	 I only have one comment on this: You call this a *classic* playoff year and yet you don't include a Chicago-Detroit series. C'mon, I'm a Boston fan and I even realize that Chicago-Detroit games are THE most exciting games to watch. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Ottawa picks first, because they had fewer wins during the season, the first tiebreaker.

rec.sport.hockey	 Well, I looked at the scoring plan I had, and have decided to modify it. Here is the new, finalized scoring: 
rec.sport.hockey	 Yup. I agree with ya. I think Devils can beat Red Wings easily. SO I think all those who send in their votes should try all these diffrent teams before voting. I think Islanders and Quebec are much better then I had expected. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Ruotsaleinen was a more than competent NHL'er...his choice of where to play when did not bear on his hockey playing ability. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Could someone post the Flyers record with and without Eric Lindros in the lineup 
rec.sport.hockey	 I recently bought a pack of prospect hockey cards which had various players that were coming into the NHL. I got this particular card of a Russian named Viktor Kozlov. It says "many scouts believe he will be the #1 pick in 1993". Another guy is quoted as saying "He's as good as Mario Lemieux". Anyone know who this guy is????? 
rec.sport.hockey	 Well, as long as we're being unduly cocky here, It's obvious that the Pens will cone out of the Patrick Division *not* the Caps, and also that they will win thier third Stanley Cup. "Collective Wisdom" is a very polite way of putting it, I don't know if I'd be so gracious. And, for what it's worth (Probably not much) I think the Habs will come out of the Adams too. Not new, Long absent, Mikey D. __ 
rec.sport.hockey	 What is this crap? I'm only interested in intelligent discussion. If you can't answer my question, just say so. Can anyone else answer the ques.? 
rec.sport.hockey	 I thought the red light went on...thus, in the review, the presumption would be to find conclusive evidence that the puck did not go in the net...from the replays I say, even from the rear, the evidence wasn't conclusive that the puck was in or out...in my opinion... 
rec.sport.hockey	 I found this press release from Trial Lawyers for Public Justice on another system, and thought it would be of interest on campuses where the administration or the athletics department wants to eliminate the women's ice hockey team. 
rec.sport.hockey	 It seemed pretty conclusive to me. The puck clearly hit the crossbar and then came down on the line. And the announcers, admittedly homers, kept harping about how they "must have had a different view upstairs" because it was obvious to them, and, I would have thought, to anyone who saw the replay, that the puck didn't go in. The referee originally signalled no goal but the video replay "judges" initiated contact with the referee to claim that a goal was in fact scored. This, to me, is unheard of. Seeing stuff like this happen gives me a bad feeling about the Leaf chances this year. 
rec.sport.hockey	 un, you better add at least another plus to the Pederson for Neely trade, the Bruins also received a number 1 round draft pick, didn't play great this year but Wesley's still a decent defenseman.... And the Bruins got Pederson back eventually anyway..... 
rec.sport.hockey	 Well I just read in the Boston Globe that while not confirming (or denying) anything, Walsh may end up with the Rangers organizations as an (assistant Coach?). Keenan has talked with Walsh in the past (he came up to see Kariya as he will be coaching him in the worlds, funny I guess he got to watch the Ferraro brothers as well.....) I'm not sure if walsh will go, but if Keenan is getting 700,000 and walsh even gets 100,000 that's a 30% pay raise for walsh (not to mention a nice career move....) Anyone from New York Hear anything about this???????? 
rec.sport.hockey	 I am not at all clear about what you are trying to say here. If you asked somone, who had never heard of hockey before, if LA played in the Smythe division what do you think that the response would be? What if you asked this person if LA played in the West division? The naming of divisions after long-dead entrepreneurs is unnecessary obfuscation. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Does anyone out there have the shorthanded goal totals of the NHL players for this season? We're trying to finish our rotisserie stats and need SHG to make it complete. 
rec.sport.hockey	 You know... after I finished laughing I thought: This would be a great final. Two Canadian teams with lots of tradition and all that Don Cherry nonsense behind them and a nail-biter finish. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Yes, it's a shame that the NHL lost a fine team in one of the best hockey markets in the country. Being a North Stars fan, it is sad to see all of the tradition of the last 26 years get thrown into oblivion at the hands of a truly crappy owner. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Messier was not invited due to his nagging injuries. While the press made an issue of it, and attempted to link it to the Rangers' internal political woes, Mike Keenan repeated that to Messier personally during the MSG press conference. It makes sense ... Messier would probably have not declined the invitation if it were made for publicity ...

There are at least 40 entries, and hopefully more people will enter before the deadline, which is 7:30 pm Today, Sunday, April 18, 1993!

Here they are:

rec.sport.hockey	 You think that's bad? I'm in Bowling Green, OH, and we get ABC from Toledo. Well, the cable co. decided to totally pre-empt the game (no tape delay, no nothing) for a stupid telethon! Hockey is very big around here, too. I had to listen to "my" Penguins win on my car radio out in the parking lot. I can just be thankful for a strong radio because being 230 miles from Pittsburgh, the reception usually isn't good at all. I can't believe I picked it up during the middle of the day. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Are people here stupid or what??? It is a tie breaker, of cause they have to have the same record. How can people be sooooo stuppid to put win as first in the list for tie breaker??? If it is a tie breaker, how can there be different record???? Man, I thought people in this net are good with hockey. I might not be great in Math, but tell me how can two teams ahve the same points with different record??? Man...retard!!!!!! Can't believe people actually put win as first in a tie breaker...... 
rec.sport.hockey	 The Blues scored two power-play goals in 17 seconds in the third period and the beat the Chicago Blackhawks 4-3 Sunday afternoon at Chicago Stadium. Brendan Shanahan tied the game 3-3 and Brett Hull scored the game winner 17 seconds later. Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals. Brian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good goaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the stretch to preserve the Blues lead. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Well I don't see any smileys here. I am trying to figure out if the poster is a dog or a wordprocessor. Couldn't be neither. Both are smarter than this.

rec.sport.hockey	 The mission to revive hockey at UMass is now underway. At the 4 PM Saturday afternoon press conference held at the new Mullins Center Arena - former Boston College Asst. Coach Joe Mallen was awarded the 4 year, $85,000/year contract as Head Coach for the UMass Minutemen. 
rec.sport.hockey	 There are ALWAYS scalpers with tickets outside the Arena. You might have to pay a few bucks extra, but you can always find them. Look on the street under the message board, or out on the street in front of the Hyatt, or even around Gate 1. The later you buy them, the less money you'll pay, and during the regular season you could usually find some for near face value or below if you wait until game time. Might be better to pick them up earlier now, though. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Why not? I believe both the Devils and Islanders got 87 points. Say for example, another team had this record : 20-37-47; they had 20*2+47*1+37*0=87 which is the same as their points total. (The Islanders' and Devils' records are both 40-37-7. 
rec.sport.hockey	 How was this trade bad? I seem to recall Ratelle and Middleton making a pretty good centre - right wing combination, and the Bruins also got Brad Park in the deal (and they also lost Vadnais and somebody else). After the trade, the Bruins were in two finals and one semi-final, all of which, of course, they lost to Montreal (which should please you to no end). I doubt, however, keeping Esposito would have made a difference in those series, as he did not for the Rangers in '79 (or any of his years in Boston, for that matter). 
rec.sport.hockey	 Well put, Jason. I am not from Wisconsin, but I have close relatives who live in Port Washington (about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee), I visit the city regularly, and I have been in the Bradley four times to see the Admirals play and the NCAA Hockey Championships. It is a beautiful building. The Pettits and the city like to promote it as the best facility for hockey in North America. As to what will happen with the Admirals if Milwaukee does acquire a franchise, word is the team will move to Green Bay and play in the Brown County Arena. Once again, the Admirals are an independent franchise, and the people of Milwaukee have been supporting them well. The games I have been to have seen crowds anywhere from 10,000 to 13,000, which are numbers some NHL teams (i.e. the Islanders, Hartford, New Jersey) would be envious of having on some nights. Plus the fact that the city is able to support a minor league franchise without the glamour of having an NHL club affiliated to it is testimony to the amount of hockey interest exists in the city. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I think that you are incorrect, Roger. Patrick, Smythe and Adams all played or coached in the league before becoming front office types. Hence, they did help build the league, although they were not great players themselves. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Why? I'm calling this Penguins ... in 6. Only that with the way things stand, the only radio game at that hour is from the Devils on WABC, 770 AM. It'd be nice to have a Sony Watchman, but ... 
rec.sport.hockey	 Punch Imlach's contributions as a coach and GM were far greater than those of the above combined. Should we name a division or trophy after him? Smythe and Norris and the bunch were honoured purely because they were powerful owners. As owners they certainly did help to build the league but whether they developed the game is another question altogether. Are we going to honour those who contributed to the league's evolution or are we going to honour those who contributed to the glory of the sport itself? 
rec.sport.hockey	 Depends on what you mean by classy. From what I've heard about him, he was about as classy as Harold Ballard. Only difference was that back then almost all the owners were like that, so he seemed okay by comparison. Read the book "Net Worth" for one view of what Smythe (and Norris and Adams and Campbell) were like.

rec.sport.hockey	 Roger Nebula bad blood bath) and with high hopes turned to new coach Mr. Klean (Commissar Keenan)... I would like to know what procedures hockey teams use to select their captains (including A's). Are they selected by the coaching staff, do the players vote for a captain, or are they appointed by management? 
rec.sport.hockey	 The Leafs have always been kind of comical. During the second Imlach era, when Darryl Sittler was called a "cancer on the team", he tore the C off his sweater and for a while the Leafs didn't have a Captain. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Golly, I love stupid people. :-) Listen, Rex, this is hockey. The NHL, to be precise. And in the NHL, there exist these things called "ties". A tie occurs when a game ends with the score for each team equal. Each team gets one point for a tie. There also exits these things called "wins". A win is when one team has a higher score than the opponent. (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other at a time, so I can say "the opponent".) A team gets two points for a win. So, let's say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10 ties. Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties. The first team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points. The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86 points. WOW! They *both* have the same number of points, but the number of wins is different! How did they do that??!?!?!?! That's amazing. So, Rex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then that's what it means. In our example, the second team would win the tiebreaker and therefore have the "better" record, even though both teams had the same number of points. If you didn't understand this post, Rex, maybe you should go back and read it again, very slowly. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Well, it's not that bad. But I am still pretty pissed of at the local ABC coverage. They cut off the first half hour of coverage by playing David Brinkley at 12:30 instead of an earlier time slot. I don't even understand their problem. If they didnt think enough people would 
rec.sport.hockey	 Picture if you will, the Habs going into the last couple minutes of the game, leading 2-0. The Nords get a power play, pull Hextall, and get a goal. Bout a minute later, they get another one. Then they win in overtime...... 
rec.sport.hockey	 Are there any further stories to report on the eve' of Norm's farewell from the twin cities? In an earlier post, it was announced that Norm Green was given until midnight of the last home-game of the North Stars to cleanup his belongings and turn in the keys to the arena. Did this happen? Was Norm run-out-of-town? 
rec.sport.hockey	 You think that's bad ... one year, we had all three New York teams in the playoffs and the cableco operator (SCNY once shared a channel with BET but someone forgot to throw the switch at 6PM) didn't know what I was talking about ... 
rec.sport.hockey	 As the subject suggests the Flames were not impressive this afternoon, dropping a 6-3 decision to the LA Kings. Most of the Flames neglected to show up, especially in their own zone, as the Kings hit at least five posts! The Flames best line was probably Skrudland-Paslawski-Berube (which tells how bad the Flames were). Gary Suter scored a great goal (in fact all three Flame goals were scored by D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others), but also made some bonehead plays. For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especially impressive. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Well, I have compiled some statistics on the entries of my pool. There are unofficially 52 entrants. Here are the stats on what teams were picked to win it all: 
rec.sport.hockey	 This game would have been great as part of a double-header on ABC or ESPN; the league would have been able to push back-to-back wins by Le Magnifique and The Great One. Unfortunately, the only network that would have done that was SCA, seen in few areas and hard to justify as a pay channel. )-; 
rec.sport.hockey	 Actually, Messier was invited, but declined due to nagging injuries... Keenan and Messier have always gotten along...Keenan dumped Steve Yzerman from the last Canada Cup team, even though Yzerman had endured the training camp, when Messier who had missed essentially the entire camp recovering from injuries became available at the last moment. 
rec.sport.hockey	 People are seeming to be less concerned about Kariya's size as he leads teams to championships (World Junior and US College) and collects awards...everyone is watching with interest as to how he will perform on left wing with Eric Lindros and Mark Recchi at the world championships. 
rec.sport.hockey	 the era of the Original 6, four teams made the playoffs. To win the Cup, a team had to win two seven-game series - in other words it took 8 playoff wins to win the Cup. The octopus (8 legs) has become a common Detroit symbol. Every year around playoff time people start sneaking octopus (octopi?) into the Joe Louis Arena and throwing them onto the ice. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Here is a summary of Don Cherry's coach's corner from April 18, 1993. It took place in the first intermission of game 1 of the Montreal-Quebec series. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Mike Vernon is now 3 wins 11 losses plus that All-Star game debacle in afternoon games during his career...with another afternoon game with Los Angeles next Sunday...has the ABC deal doomed the Flames? 
rec.sport.hockey	 What's with you stupid dorks from the "Western Business School"???!!! First there was that Cary asshole, and now you. Don't you have anything better to do instead of being obnoxious, antagonistic little shits over the network??? Why don't you just take a hike, and stop embarrasing yourself, your school, and Canada! 
rec.sport.hockey	 Here in Nanaimo (on Vancouver Island, for you furriners out there) we got the ABC coverage on KOMO. It probably depends on your cable company. 
rec.sport.hockey	 How do you figure that?? When Bryan Murray took over the Wings they were a pretty good team that was contending for the Stanley Cup but looked unlikely to win it. Now they are a pretty good team that is contending for the Stanley Cup but looks unlikely to win it. A truly great GM would have been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon of the NHL and maybe win the Stanley Cup. A good GM (like Murray) can maintain the team's success but can't push them to the next level. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Not in Indiana: they showed a tape-delay of Chicago v Boston, because WGN had the rainout of the cubs. So WGN showed reruns of Hitchcock. No hockey (at least in this part of the state). 
rec.sport.hockey	 Roger Maynard shares his views, with the masses, on Bob Gainey and life in general: 
rec.sport.hockey	 News reports in Toronto say that the Rangers are insisting that Kovalev, Zubov, and Andersson play for Binghampton in the Calder Cup playoffs, rather than return to play for their "home" countries in the World Championships. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Here are my predictions (try not to laugh hysterically) Somebody save this so I can laugh when I win my own pool. I don't have prizes, but we all love BRAGGING RIGHTS, so winner takes them. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Sorry, my memory is gone. I thought that O'Neill got sent back down in February but I must have been given incorrect info. I guess this says it all about Moncton because Barnes is still one of their top 3 or so scorers even though he's been out since January. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Vielen dank Desperate Fan 
rec.sport.hockey	 Has anyone heard what game ESPN is showing tonight. They said they will show whatever game means the most playoff-wise. I would assume this would be the Blues-Tampa game or the Minnesota-Red Wings game... Anyone heard for sure??? 
rec.sport.hockey	 Why should we pay your predictions any heed, considering you couldn't even predict the proper matchups? Maybe you should try forecasting the weather instead. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Perhaps it was Trottier. It happened behind the Habs goal if I recall. Gainey simply didn't have his head up as he was picking up the puck. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Everyone keeps talking about European expansion by 2010 thinking wishful thoughts, but being totally off the ball. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Which GERMAN satellite channels will show the World Championship action from Dusseldorf & Munich? Someone please tell me (must be able to root for the Red Machine)! 
rec.sport.hockey	 So in other words, if Roussel shuts out the Sharks and Soderstrom shuts out the Penguins, that's immaterial because it was the coaches decision? Come on, Joe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant. Why they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams is better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good teams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I saw a mask once that had drawings of band-aids, presumably for every puck that goalie stopped with his face/head. I can't remember who it was or even if it was NHL (I see quite a few AHL games here). 
rec.sport.hockey	 Gretzky, Lemieux, Gilmour etc do not play the role of checking centreman. They play an offensive role as opposed to a defensive one. If they were used as defensive centres it would be a waste of their offensive abilities. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Anyone who really believes that the Caps can beat the Pens are kidding themselves. The Pens may not loose one game in the playoffs. 
rec.sport.hockey	 You know what Frank? It's not David Poile's fault that the Caps have mired in mediocrity for so long. Blame it on the owner, Abe Polin! This guy owns both the NBA's Bullets and the NHL's Capitals. How dumb and selfish could this guy be? He's unwilling to spend the bucks in order to get a big star to Landover...no wonder both teams STINK! 
rec.sport.hockey	 Hmmmm, I'm not sure this is true. According to Mike Lang and good old Stagie, along with the rest of the TV crews in pittsburgh, they winning streak could have stopped because it is a regular season mark. I would think this would also hold with an unbeaten streak for regular season games. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Except for Vancouver, of course. Bure has a hard time scoring on that power play. He's got 7 shorthanded goals and 13 pp goals I think! 
rec.sport.hockey	 Well, the tentative rules, anyway. And, of course, since the season is not entirely over, tentative entry form. But who cares? The real hockey season is starting!!!!! 
rec.sport.hockey	 Okay, here's the entry sheet. Keep in mind that not all spots are decided, so it may change. 
rec.sport.hockey	 The Ottwawa Senators fired Mel Bridgman at 1:00 PM today. Randy Sexton is gonna replace him. 
rec.sport.hockey	 First,Happy Birthday,Val. Second, ESPN's affinity with Patrick has probably more to do with the travel/production costs for a once a week NHN(National Hockey Night) affair.(ESPN-ABC owner,Capital Cities, is a company known for being quite thrifty with minimal overhead costs. It's quite possible that Jim Schoenfeld may be working for doughnuts :-). 
rec.sport.hockey	 Here is a review of some of the off-ice things that have affected the AHL this year. 
rec.sport.hockey	 DALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON After announcing that they would pull their affiliation out of Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Later on, in your posting, you make reference to "putting words into other people's mouths"...I would suggest that your last paragraph can only be interpreted in one way...namely, that I, along with Greg, claim that Gainey never made a technical mistake. If you actually read what I've written, you will find that I make no such claim...soooo, if logic serves me well, you're contradicting yourself. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I live in the desolate MidWest (as far as hockey is concerned) and our "sports" stores around here carry VERY LITTLE hockey stuff, except for San Jose, Tampa Bay, L.A., Pittsburgh, and if you're lucky Chicago. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Nonsense. I quite clearly state that it was Greg that made the claim that Gainey never made an error. And he made the claim. Read below. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I.Mario Lemieux A.Death 1.Too much Kimo 2.Slash to skull 3.Ask the Rangers (Slashing his wrist????) II.Jaromir Jagr A.Deportation 1.Send him back to whatever Commie country' "he's from 2.Tell him that Bill Clinton is going too III.Kevin Stevens A.Fighting 1.Call Bob Probert 2.Call Tie Domi 3.Call my grandmother (She'd kick his ass) 
rec.sport.hockey	 I haven't heard any news about ASN carrying any games but the local cable station here in St. John's (Cable 9) is carrying the games live! 
rec.sport.hockey	 I think, as do the owners, that hockey will do well in Miami since there is a lot of people from the Northeast that spend their winters in Florida every year. As for the coverage, someone will have to come up with some money for that since broadcast rights can be expensive! 
rec.sport.hockey	 I heard it will be the Minnesota-Detroit game. Don't know the time though. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Well Bruins fans it's playoff time again. It looks like the B's have peaked at the right time. Getting out of the Adams is going to be a cat fight to the end. After what they did to Montreal and Quebec, these teams will be out for revenge. If Neely can stay healthy, and both Bourque and Moog stay sharp, we should get to see Neely finally take out two years of frustration on Ulf (I don't fight) Samuelson. I don't agree with fighting in the NHL, but if there is one guy who deserves to be taken out good, it's him. 
rec.sport.hockey	 MY HOCKEY EDUCATION? What the f--- are you talking about? I'm not even going to try to refute this absolutely insane statement. 
rec.sport.hockey	 PATRICK 1st rd:tPens over Isles in 4. Devils over Caps in 6. 2nd:tPens over Devils in 7.

rec.sport.hockey	 Well, actually now that you mention it, a few weeks ago the CBC ran a documentary on "Ice Hockey in Harlem". the Canadian Club of New York (something like that) sponsors a league for kids in Harlem and based on the TV report they all seemed to be having a lot of fun. All playing with regular equipment, jerseys, etc etc, on a proper outdoor rink. It looked just like kids playing hockey anywhere else. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Jagr has a higher +/-, but Francis has had more points. And take it from an informed observer, Ronnie Francis has had a *much* better season than Jaromir Jagr. This is not to take anything away from Jaro, who had a decent year (although it didn't live up to the expectations of some). 
rec.sport.hockey	 Let's be honest. The Pens may not 'loose' one game as you put it, but they will definitely lose one game. Remember, the regular season doesn't mean much when it comes to playoff time. The Caps have a shot at least - the Flyers' "sure don't 
rec.sport.hockey	 Lemieux for the Masterson? No doubt he had an awe inspiring season, but what personal records did he set this year? Lemieux should have Hart locked up...but how about Mike Gartner for the Masterson? 
rec.sport.hockey	 Hmmm...I also heard through the grapevine that Team Finland might try and leave a spot open for at least one NHLer. (Some guy named Sel{nne, ever hear of him? :) They might have to be content with Kurri, though, I hope. :) 
rec.sport.hockey	 Hey, what about the "Roger Maynard Award" for the most annoying fan....? 
rec.sport.hockey	 As the Sharks' season came to a close tonight, I will start a series of posts, trying to revisit the players, the trades, the moves, etc., that went through for the Sharks for the past season. If you are uninterested, since I will have the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings, you can kill them. 
rec.sport.hockey	 It is really annoying to see all of these predictions on the Net. Who really cares who you think will win? Please stop with the predictions, we all know the Caps are going to win the Cup, so let it go at that. 
rec.sport.hockey	 True, coach Matikainen is ready to keep a spot for Teemu all the way until the medal games. He wants Teppo Numminen, too. And Kurri, but for them the spots cannot be left open for too long. Esa Tikkanen we have already. 
rec.sport.hockey	 As far as I know Dusseldorf has only one Canadian-German forward (i.e. a player who was born in Canada but now has a German passport). Benoit Doucet became german by marriing a german and he is going to play for Germany in the WC. 
rec.sport.hockey	 This will be my last post ( promotion ) of the hockey pool.. I will update the pool ( or try to ) every wednesday 
rec.sport.hockey	 Just curious, Roger, but since you have such a vast knowledge of the game and the league, how come you haven't made a living out of it? There must be a lot of demand for expertise in the field. I'm sure you'd be of great help to, say, the Leafs as an assistant coach or a scout. Or maybe try a career as a reporter or tv commentator... 
rec.sport.hockey	 the top flight only in the early '70s. Helsingfors IFK have been around since 1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think you're exagerating here. 
rec.sport.hockey	 A fine 26 year history came to a close tonight, as the Minnesota North Stars, or Norm's Stars (whichever you prefer) lost to the Red Wings by a score of 5-3. The Stars goals were scored by Mike McPhee and Ulf Dahlen, who netted two including the final one in franchise history, with less than a minute to play. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Saku isn't that small any longer I guess I heard he is 177cm tall at the moment and will still grow 6-8cm. 
rec.sport.hockey	 on the national team plus a top-class foreigner or two. They would be in an entirely different league than TPS or Jokerit, both of whom have perhaps a dozen players of international class - if even that. Why settle for a minor league when you could have the best? 
rec.sport.hockey	 KDKA has first rights to Pirates games, and will split probably 50-50 in conflicts; for Penguins games which are preempted, check out 102.5 WDVE FM (that's right, DVE). It is also 50,000 watts. 
rec.sport.hockey	 The new name is Florida Panthers. The panther is an endangered species, mostly located in the Everglades. A couple of years ago, there were license plates made with Panthers on them (part of the revenue were to go to some protection fund). 
rec.sport.hockey	 As I promised, I would give you the name of the Panther's president. After Huizenga announced the team name, he announced that Bill Torrey is named the first president of the Panthers. 
rec.sport.hockey	 So what's the deal with Bill Wirtz? Apparently, the Blackhawks - St. Louis game was a standing room only sell out as usual, but the Hawks reported the attendace as 16,199. Gee, I wonder if Wirtz is planning to use this as justification for continuing to keep home games off of TV? What a schmuck. 
rec.sport.hockey	 And of course, Mike Ramsey was (at one time) the captain in Buffalo prior to being traded to Pittsburgh. Currently, the Penguins have 3 former captains and 1 real captain (Lemieux) playing for them. They rotate the A's during the season (and even the C while Mario was out). Even Troy Loney has worn the C for the Pens. 
rec.sport.hockey	 What, did you leave the room each of the 100 or so times they said that there WERE NO OTHER NIGHT BASEBALL GAMES? Every break they took back at the studio mentioned it, followed by 'so...we're gonna show you hockey instead.' My wife and I are hoping for rain at every baseball game they have a feed for tommorrow night... 
rec.sport.hockey	 scored no less than six goals against the best goaltender in the world en route to a 6-3 win over the best team in the NHL, the Toronto Maple Leafs. 
rec.sport.hockey	 If I'm not mistaken, San Jose had more wins than Ottawa. First tiebreaker in the NHL is always most wins. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Boy - everyone has been ripping on ESPN's hockey coverage (or is it just Pittsburgher's who are thrilled with Lange & Steigy?) For all of you who are unaware - ESPN bought the air time from ABC and did all the production, advertising sales, commentating, etc - and even reaped any $ made... 
rec.sport.hockey	 I am looking for all the 84 boxscores of any NHL team for some personal research. Can someone help me ? 
rec.sport.hockey	 There are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the fans. I feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties more than names honouring personages. And of course, they would not appear nearly as confusing to one approaching the sport for the first time. Another thing that bothers me is the points system. Percentages, as used in the other major sports are clearly more informative. When I look at the NHL standings the first thing I have to do is make a quick calculation to account for games in hand (which is almost always the case). Some will object to percentages, claiming perhaps, that it is an "Americanization" of the sport but I feel that using percentages is more informative and whether it is "American" or not is irrelevant. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I had heard(perhaps incorrectly) that while Lemieux was out, noone wore a C on their jersey. The As took turns doing captain duties(whatever they are). 
rec.sport.hockey	 And now, I interrupt your regularly scheduled news reading to bring you another message sponsored by the Department of Really Mundane Statistics: 
rec.sport.hockey	 What is the policy regarding players and the minor league playoffs versus WC? I know that the Rangers are holding back Kovalev, Zubov, and Andersson for Binghamton, but I also know that the Whalers wanted Michael Nylander to play for Springfield, while Nylander wanted to play for Sweden. The Whalers allowed the NHL to decide, and the NHL chose the WCs. How does this differ from the Rangers and Oilers? Did the Whalers have to go through the league, or could they have forced Nylander to play in Springfield? 
rec.sport.hockey	 PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE tell me that you don't actually ATTEND Rensselaer, and that you just work for ITS. Or that this was tounge-in-cheek. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I think that Mike Foligno was the captain of the Sabres when he got traded to the Leafs. Also, wasn't Rick Vaive the captain of the Leafs when he got traded to Chicago (with Steve Thomas for Ed Olcyzk and someone). Speaking of the Leafs, I believe that Darryl Sittler was their captain (he'd torn the "C" off his jersey but I think he re-claimed the captaincy later on) when he was traded to the Flyers. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Toronto 1 1 1--3 Detroit 1 4 1--6 First period 1, Detroit, Yzerman 1 (Gallant, Ciccarelli) 4:48. 2, Toronto, Cullen 1 (Clark, Gill) 10:44.

Third period 8, Detroit, Racine 1 (Primeau, Drake) 5:10. 9, Toronto, Lefebvre 1 (Cullen, Pearson) 7:45. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Not only that, but if I'm not mistaken Detroit scored 4 goals on their first five shots on net...looks like Toronto's cream cheese run continues (or is that swiss cheese? after watching Potvin I'm leaning towards the latter) 
rec.sport.hockey	 There was apparently a 30 minute special here on the Penguins' season on ABC (WTAE - channel 4), immediately preceding the opening game against the Devils on Sunday. I only turned it on in time to watch the credits. If anyone taped it and is willing to let me borrow it to dub it, I would appreciate it. I would be willing to come pick it up, and I'll return it the next day and buy you a beer. Please respond via e-mail. Thanks a lot. Oh yeah. Was it any good? -Billy 
rec.sport.hockey	 You obviously don't understand how TV scheduling works. ESPN had prior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and had contracted all the other bs shows well in advance. The NHL TV deal was very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do this one-plus year out. The NHL package was finished two weeks before the season started). ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by squeezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesota game) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball telecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last night). 
rec.sport.hockey	 Us easterners who have newspapers with editors unsympathetic to playoff pools, often don't get summaries from west coast games since they finish too late at night for the morning edition. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I think Murray has done a great job. He's picked up Ciccarelli, Sheppard, Ysebaert, Howe, Coffey, and Riendeau (plus some depth players) without giving up anything the Wings needed or any of his top prospects. All of this in three years. Has anyone done better? 
rec.sport.hockey	 Bryan Murray has done very little as GM...Yzerman, Fedorov, Cheveldae, Chaisson, the whole Russian strategy was a product of the previous GM...Murray has made a couple of decent trades...that's about it... that would hardly rank him as the best GM. 
rec.sport.hockey	 It looks like the Edmonton Oilers just decided to take a European vacation this spring... 
rec.sport.hockey	 Rick Tocchet was captain of the Flyers for several years before he was traded to the Pens... 
rec.sport.hockey	 How exactly would Ferreira accomplished this? The three-headed GM-ship has taken a lot of heat, but nobody's explained how things would have been any different had Ferreira still been there. Would Ferreira have made more trades? Who would have he had traded? Would he have made fewer trades? Who should not have been traded? 
rec.sport.hockey	 All of this is fine. I never said that Murray was a bad GM. I merely said that he isn't the best GM in hockey- or even a contender for that honor. If Murray is as great as you claim- the Wings would have won the Stanley Cup by now- probably more than once. If he was as great a GM as you claim and he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success. But Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM so none of this is true anyway. 
rec.sport.hockey	 On 20-Apr-93 in Don Cherry - Coach's Corner.. user Allan Sullivan@cs.UAlber writes: Next, a clip was shown from an earlier episode, in which Don was proclaiming Doug Gilmour to be the best player, not only in the NHL, but in the world. What about players like Lemieux? Don said that Gilmour was the best PLAYER, not "Designated point getter". Its not like baseball, where you have a "designatted hitter" who can score runs but can't play defense. Gilmour is a good two way player. 
rec.sport.hockey	 What can you expect from a buffoon who said that the Pens should have drafted Kirk Muller instead of Mario Lemieux? 
rec.sport.hockey	 No. Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost, and Ron Hextall is the reason Quebec won. Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that goaltending was the key, etc etc. Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you're Montreal. The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it; he literally left his feet to throw an elbow. Blaming Stewart is just an excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst goals he could possibly allow. He even saw the whole shot, dammit. Besides, Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Ok, here's the solution to your problem. Move to Canada. Yesterday I was able to watch FOUR games...the NJ-PITT at 1:00 on ABC, LA-CAL at 3:00 (CBC), BUFF-BOS at 7:00 (TSN and FOX), and MON-QUE at 7:30 (CBC). I think that if each series goes its max I could be watching hockey playoffs for 40-some odd consecutive nights (I haven't counted so that's a pure guess). 
rec.sport.hockey	 As I recall, the author of the _original_ article that started the thread claimed that he disliked the changing of the names for a variety of reasons. Roger, on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that his was a "jingoistic rant", but you also supported the name-changing on the grounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individuals they represent. FWIW, I do not think the flaming was warranted, nor do I think you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all. Just an observation... 
rec.sport.hockey	 I was under the impression that the objective is to find conclusive evidence that the puck _did_ cross the line. And, the replays I saw showed fairly conclusively that the puck did _not_ cross the goal line at any time anyway. Somebody screwed up. 
rec.sport.hockey	 It was good to see the Wings play, but lets not give ESPN too much credit. There weren't any other late baseball games on so they didn't have another option. 
rec.sport.hockey	 There's quite a few Wings fans lurking about here, they just tend to be low key and thoughtful rather than woofers. I suppose every family must have a Roger Clinton, though. But remember (to paraphrase one of my favorite Star Trek lines), "if we adopt the ways of the Leaf fans, we are as bad as the Leaf fans". 
rec.sport.hockey	 There are many teams in the NHL who have taken a liking to Russian players. The "whole Russian strategy" is not specific to Detroit or to Devellano, who was GM before Murray. What the previous GM also did was to trade away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams, most notably (in my memory) Murray Craven, who had a few very good years with Philly after leaving here. Also, it's not the volume of trades that will necessarily improve a team, but the quality of them. Trading Adam Oates for Bernie Federko was just plain stupid, even if Federko used to be a great player at one time. Most of Murray's trades have worked significantly to the Wings' advantage, with those that didn't being soured mainly by injury to the players involved (such as Troy Crowder, who suffered back problems from which he never really recovered). 
rec.sport.hockey	 Did your boyfriend comment on the fact that Clement looks like a walking ad for Brillo pad hair replacement therapy? The guy's just a stuffed shirt who thinks he's the greatest hockey analyst since Howie Meeker (for gosh sakes). I'll take Schoenie any day. 
rec.sport.hockey	 They tried their best not to show it, believe me. I'm surprised they couldn't find a sprint car race (mini cars through pigpens, indeed!) on short notice. 
rec.sport.hockey	 year (viz. the early flurry of "retard" comments coming from a certain state whose name starts with P and ends with A), why don't you tell us something we don't already know? 
rec.sport.hockey	 The only reason ESPN showed that hockey came was because there was no other baseball game scheduled for the evening. 
rec.sport.hockey	 No, Caleb, it's not the quality of ESPN that I have a problem with; it is superb, whereas it did not evolve beyond the point where ESPN left off when hockey went to SC (this is excepting SC's use of feeds from CBC (-;). It's the amount of hockey they're showing, or lack of it, that we're complaining about. They had rights to two OT's that could've been shown on Sunday night after baseball ... and they had pickup trucks racing through oversized pigpens followed by Super-8 home movies of old car races (yes, I was checking in desperation for Canucks-Jets) last night after SportsCenter. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Luc Robitaille was captain of the Kings the first third of the season, until The Great One came back from his disc injury. It was kind of awkward, but Melrose appointed (anointed?) TGO as captain immediately upon his return, after which he did not score a goal for something like 10 games. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I have one complaint for the cameramen doing the Jersey-Pitt series: Show the shots, not the hits. On more than one occassion the camera zoomed in on a check along the boards while the puck was in the slot. They panned back to show the rebound. Maybe Mom's camera people were a little more experienced. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Not to mention, Mr. Francis is an incredibly nice person. Over Christmas break, a friend of mine had a little Xmas gathering. The two of us drove to Ron's house. While I stayed in the car out of shyness, my friend went to the door and rang the bell. Ron answered and my friend introduced himself. He then proceeded to invite Francis to the party. Ron declined because he "had to watch his daughter." He then reached out and shook my friend's hand! I know this isn't r.s.b., but I don't think Barry Bonds would be this polite in this situation. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Apparently, Part 2 (defensemen numbered 2 through 19) was lost when I posted it; to make things worse, I lost my own copy. I have asked on the Sharks mailing list, on which it did get out, to see if someone can mail me a copy back. If someone responds, I will repost it when I get it; otherwise, I will re-write it in a day or two and post it. Sorry about that. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I finally got it back, with great thanks to Mark Spiegel for saving and sending it. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Hm, do you think Dusseldorf fans would like it if their team joined the NHL? Or do we have to include Koln as well (Cologne to you Anglophiles) to make them happy?:-) 
rec.sport.hockey	 Gerry Cheevers used to have a mask that had stitches painted all over it. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Hello Hockey fans. Bonjour tout le monde! 
rec.sport.hockey	 During the regular season, when the intensity is down, not many teams have forwards who will continually go and park themselves in front of the opposing teams net...and the inadequacy of the Leafs defense in this regard thus didn't matter...however, the playoffs are a different story...every good team is going to have players who are going to become potted plants in front of Potvin...and the Leafs relatively unphysical defensive core will finally be exposed as weak an inept. 
rec.sport.hockey	 His designated point-getter remarks were not only meant for Lemieux, but for Gretzky, Bure, etc. etc. .... and he made those particular remarks last December before Lemieux was diagnosed with Hodgkin's, and as the Leafs started their second half roll, and before Gilmour's great season was being recognized by many people. 
rec.sport.hockey	 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Who's the mindscheme(?) behind this one -- Ted Simmons? As the saying goes, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." I'm 230 miles from home (during the school year) and will never be able to pick up DVE. At least now I can sort of make out what Mike and Steigy say through all the static on KDKA. This just may be enough reason for me to transfer to Duquesne and live at home. Who's going to announce on DVE anyway? Paulson and Krenn? (Just kidding.) 
rec.sport.hockey	 What are the Leafs to do? I am a Leaf supporter and I say the Leafs are going down in four unless there is nothing short of a miracle or a stroke of genenius hits Pat Burns. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I should have guessed. It's time for the annual Pittsburgh Penguins whine-a-thon. Bowman was complaning about cheap shots by the Devils in Game 1. I'm sorry, Mr. Bowman, you're a great coach, but those "cheap shots" were nothing compared to what's going to come. Also, I guess you were only able to notice the cheap shots made by the guys not in white. It's amazing what those black and gold colored glasses will do. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I'm totally p*-o'd, too! Vancouver-Winnipeg is great west-coast hockey - fast-paced and loads of talent. What I've seen so far is hardly entertaining, with the exception of the odd shift every now & then (of course I missed Calgary-LA & Pitts-Jersey...) 
rec.sport.hockey	 Sorry to everyone for wasting space. Matt, the other day you posted that you were doing a mailing list of playoff stats. I lost your address. Please put me on that list. Thanks. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Devallano went earlier and more extensively to the Russian strategy than anyone else...and was the first GM to "waste" high draft choices on young Russians...Devallano would still be GM but he succombed to Demers pleading to make the Oates-Federko et al trade...which is the deal that sealed his fate. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I don't think Primeau is necessarily a bad pick...I'm was just trying to locate the beginning of Murray's decisions...he slowness in trading Carson has delayed Primeau's development...and you have to wait longer for big players often...and Primeau can be a very good player without being a point-a-game-player, especially on a team that has Yzerman and Fedorov...if Primeau becomes Joel Otto, and gets 20 goals a season, and plays mean...it will have been an extremely good pick. 
rec.sport.hockey	 The San Jose Sharks and Ottawa Senators are each on their second GM already...I'd be willing to wager that both the Sharks and Senators will probably see their 3rd GM's and perhaps their 4th, before we see the Panthers second. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Obviously, it is ultimately the teams choice...the NHL would obviously prefer not to annoy the European hockey federations, but the NHL right now cannot force NHL teams to free their players...the Whalers probably did it this way so as to not annoy their farm team affiliate. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Yeah, the Nords look like they're going to be good...but (excuse the bias) have you ever watched the Pens on a rush?...Don't answer: everyone has seen this footage. Near the end of the season when the Pens played the Nords it was like watching a (younger) double of the Pens. ...The Nords looked good right up to the point when they lost. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I know that there wasn't other games on the schedule, but ESPN sometimes shows classic games from previous season to fill in the time slot. 
rec.sport.hockey	 With everyone bitching about the hockey coverage by ESPN its almost like the Detroit-Toronto game was not televised last nite. I was just thankful to see hockey on a night that it wasn't supposed to be carried. Thanks to ESPN, no matter why they televised the game 
rec.sport.hockey	 This is incorrect. This year the Pens had 61 games on "free" TV and 6 games on PPV. Next year they will have 62 games on free TV and 22 on a subscription basis. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Exactly. That is my biggest complaint about the coverage so far. Follow that damn puck! 
rec.sport.hockey	 Pray for the Wings to become lazy and overconfident...the Wings can only lose the series...Toronto cannot win it. Take away Doug Gilmour and the Leafs are an old Tampa Bay. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Well, I'm a Wings fan and I think the FIRST thing that you should do is to get the opponent's line combinations correct before you try to match up anyone with them. There is no Yzerman-Fedorov-Probert line, except for maybe on a powerplay. These three players usually play on three different lines. Which would mean that Toronto's checking line would have to pull a triple shift.' "The Wings' lines usually look like this: 
rec.sport.hockey	 Good comeback, Rog. Your quick wit and intelligence continues to amaze everyone. 
rec.sport.hockey	 This is the new Buffalo one, the second since he's been with the Sabres? I recall a price tag of over $700 just for the paint job on that mask, and a total price of almost $1500. Ouch. 
rec.sport.hockey	 It may have been passed to Toronto, but I've even seen an octopus at the Aud -- last year's Bruins-Sabres game. I knew all about the Detroit version, but seeing at the Aud was a bit puzzling. :-) 
rec.sport.hockey	 Kevin L. Stamber Purdue University ...and Phil Kirzyc (The Kielbasa Kid) will roam the Arena for interviews. 
rec.sport.hockey	 The worst thing is that this is exactly what I did last year. I had the Rangers on MSG, and the two different games on SCNY and SCA on at the same time. Yes, I'd rather have SC cover it, just for the amount of coverage. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Woops! This is rec.sport.hockey! Not rec.sport.golf! Hope you check the newsgroup header next time before posting! 
rec.sport.hockey	 It's not really crap you know... only half crap ;-) From what i understand it's very expensive to play hockey south of the border... (actually it's not that cheap up hear either... though once you have all the equipement it's not more than $300 a year... actually i haven' played in about 8 years so i could be off a bit... ) In the states, where ice time is considerably more expensive it can cost over a thousand a year... compare this to baseball and you'll see that hockey is a sport for the well-to-do... And this brings up the fact that the well-to-do in the US are majority white... 
rec.sport.hockey	 NJ : And, while we are on the subject, has a captain ever been traded, NJ : resigned, or been striped of his title during the season? Any other NJ : team captain trivia would be appreciated. 
rec.sport.hockey	 How long can the Leafs play short-handed and still be expected to score? They did some fine penely-killing in the first (2 men down for a couple of minutes at one point) but they just couldn't keep it up. They spent virtually the entire game either short-handed or just coming off a penelty -- as soon as they'd get re-grouped, they're penalized again! 
rec.sport.hockey	 During the Detroit game Mon night there were octopus thrown on the ice what is the meaning or symbolism here? They used to throw fish on the ice here in Spokane afew years ago. I never knew where this came from. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Kevin Todd is an Oiler and has been one for months. How closely do you follow the Devils, anyway? Jeez.... 
rec.sport.hockey	 Then allow me to enlighten you, Rex. You see, there's a thing called a tie. A tie is worth one point (I know, I know. You're not good at math. But bear with me). A win is worth two points. So, getting two ties is the same as getting one win. If your team played two games, won one and lost one, you'd have two points. If my team played two games and tied them both, we'd also have two points. We'd be tied in the standings even though our records are different. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I think you missed one of my points there. It takes *more* than a great GM to win a stanley cup, even once. Some of the guys on the list you gave earlier never won one. I agree that you and I could probably argue back and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey- that is a matter of opinion, and who is to say my opinion is any better than yours or yours than mine? But the point of my *original* original post (if not well stated) was that Murray has the GM abilities but not the coaching abilities. Which leads to below: 
rec.sport.hockey	 But only in NY,NJ, Philadelphia, and Chicago. Everywhere else, the only reason SportsChannel was available was for local baseball broadcasts. And local baseball pre-empted the NHL playoffs. Thus far into this playoff season, ESPN/ABC has given me more hockey in 2 days (1 game) than SportsChannel did (0 games). 
rec.sport.hockey	 I don't buy this at all. Roy was the reason the game was tied... and that would *not* have been the case had Dionne kept his cool. Hextall gave up 2 very questionable goals himself ... Both Dionne's and Bellows' shots were misplayed by Hextall, but just because his gaffes were early in the game, no one seems to care. Roy stood on his head for the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from end-to-end. Kamensky's mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy. Roy outplayed Hextall for most of the game, but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero because Roy's team didn't make full use of their opportunities. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Actually Steve, I think he was refering to the Leafs, and when they can be expected to hit the greens... 
rec.sport.hockey	 Yeah, the news is true...the Leafs lost to the Wings 6-3. Wish I could say I'd seen the whole game but my husband wanted to watch "Young Guns II" on another channel. Sometime between the first time I tuned in and d saw the Leafs tie and the next time I tuned in and heard the score was 5-1, something happened. Please no woofing from Red Wings fans. They're my third favourite team, and if they make it past the Leafs I'll wish them luck. As for Potvin...well, it WAS his fist playoff game. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I think the three-headed GM's guiding principle was to keep veterans in favor of youngsters only if they offered a "significant" advantage. At the end of last season, the contracts of several veterans with somewhat maginal contributions (Fenton, Bozek, Anderson, and a couple others I can't remember) were bought out. The idea was that youngsters could play almost as well, and had the potential to improve where these older guys did not. And they traded Mullen, because he wanted to go, not because he wasn't good enough, but I think they were a bit too optimistic in thinking they could make up for his contributions. An example from this season, Skriko was brought in on a trial basis but not kept, because of his age. I thought he was a decent contributor worth keeping around. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Here are the standings after game 1 of each of the divisional semi-finals. (Hey, look who's #4!) I'll try to post the standings after "each game" (i.e. every two days). 
rec.sport.hockey	 Yes, a point well-taken ... however, even in areas that finally got some games, there's something nagging in the back of your skull when the network that has the national rights in its pocket says on its sports news, "There's an awesome overtime going on in Quebec City, and we'll *try* to get you an update through the show ..." when you know that it's on a satellite's feedhorn somewhere up there ... 
rec.sport.hockey	 I am in need of all of the players wearing #77 in the NHL. I know now only of one, Ray Borque for the Bruins. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I agree. It was great for the ESPN people to show the Detroit game. (My roommate just about sh*t when they threw the octopus on the ice. (Thanks for explaining the significance of that BTW)) The only problem I had was when they blotted out the local commentators with the baseball ads and music. Especially when the wings player hit the rut and went into the boards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report. Other then that, hats off to ESPN. Now if they'll only make a habit of this. Yeah right! Baseball seasons started (Zzzzzz.....) =) 
rec.sport.hockey	 Oh to be back in the good old days when I lived in Florida (Florida for Petes sake!!) and could watch hockey every night as ESPN and USA alternated coverage nights. Oh well I guess it would be too simple for the home office to look back into their past to solve a problem in the present... 
rec.sport.hockey	 Well what do you expect...Burns was playing him with Krushelnyski and Baumgartner...Anderson is a finisher...unless you play him with someone to can get him the puck in a finishing position...he ain't going to do much scoring! 
rec.sport.hockey	 Game two of the Detroit - Toronto series will be a rougher game. I believe that Clark will be coming out hitting on all cylindars. I believe that Probert will take exception to this and a fight between Clark and Probert will result. I know this sounds kind of ridiculous, but I know game two Toronto will come out hitting. Any takers on this issue? 
rec.sport.hockey	 Since everybody wants to see Pittsburgh players not playing, the Stanley cup would be devaluated. 
rec.sport.hockey	 From this account, it doesn't sound like you even saw the goal, Mike. Smith came out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit Fuhr in the back of the leg. Fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw what happened. The puck went straight off Fuhr's leg and into the net. Fuhr never had a chance. There was no play back to the goaltender, in fact Perry Berezan of Calgary had just dumped it in and Smith was retrieving it. 
rec.sport.hockey	 It would seem logical that the mask is Potvins. His nickname is "The Cat", which would go a long ways towards explaining the panther. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Does anyone have the NHL STANDINGS for March 28th? I need them IMMEDIATELY for a project. Please post or email. THANKS. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Yes, Colin... I have to agree with you here... I've put the puck in my own net the same way Smith did... (only once, mind you :-) and it was definitely my fault. It is NOT a common play to play the puck the way that Smith did. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I have to disagree with you on this one. It is anything BUT common. In the 4 or 5 years I have been watching hockey I have NEVER seen this happen EVER. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Look how long the Maple Leafs and Nordiques used similar logic.... Not that they fielded bad teams solely to field bad teams, but the Maple Leafs (and a certain dead man who was in charge) were one of the cheapest teams in the history of the sport. Guess what-- they were immensely popular at the gate. The Nordiques have also done well for a team that had missed the playoffs so many years in a row. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Does anyone know if there will be alternate games in cities where local broadcast rights are being protected? I'd really love to see the Bruins a couple times, and with this pro-Patrick bias shown by ESPN something tells me that I will have to wait until the conference finals to see them :-}. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Hopefully, a miracle (o.k. not quite a miracle, but close!) will occur and Pittsburgh will be elminated prior to the finals. If they make it again, they will probably keep the Cup. If they don't, it's the Hawks' turn! 
rec.sport.hockey	 Don't be so sure, the Blues played the Hawks pretty well this season, and won twice at the Stadium. The Blues will give the Hawks a hard time. This series is one of the best first round matchups, could go either way. The Hawks will probably prevail in seven games.

rec.sport.hockey	 Trashy move from a trashy organization. After the front office stated that nobody would lose their job over the Sens. poor performance, Bridgeman is gone within 24 hours of the teams final game. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I've heard that you can score on Belfour by shooting high because he goes down a lot, and on Potvin by shooting high on him and then getting the rebound in because he plays so deep in the net. Any truth to these? 
rec.sport.hockey	 Yeah, but first they have to deal with the Devils, who've had their number all year. I'm not saying the Caps aren't a good team (they've been a thorn on the Habs side for the past 10 years!!!), just that they won't get past NJ... 
rec.sport.hockey	 Soderstrom plays with Philly, but he doesn't have a moulded mask. He's got the helmet and cage variety, in white. Or at least that's what he wore thirteen hours ago. 
rec.sport.hockey	 It has been announced that the Senators will move their AHL franchise to Charlottetown, P.E.I. (Prince Edward Island), not New Brunswick. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Ok guys, I need a list of the teams who have been hot or cold during the last 25 games. Doesn't need to be accurate, a rough guess will do. I'm about to enter a playoff pool and I want to know who is hot going into the playoffs. Don't need to mention Pittsburgh. They can't get any hotter than they are now. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Bowman tended to overplay Francis at times because he is a Bowman-style player. He plays hard at all times, doesn't disregard his defensive responsibilities and is a good leader. Bowman rewarded him be increasing his ice time. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Funny you should mention this; one time on HNIC Don Cherry pointed out Vanbiesbrouck's mask. He _hated_ it. I think he said something to the effect of: "You see? He was great last year; now he goes out and gets that dopey mask and he can't stop a beachball!" 
rec.sport.hockey	 I AM an Ulf (and Pgh) fan, and what pisses me off about the whole Adam Graves/ Ulf Samuesson debate is that Ulf plays hard-hitting hockey (nothing wrong with that) while Graves does what he does when the only way to win a game is to intentionally hurt someone (which bites!). 
rec.sport.hockey	 This is very sad indeed. My condolences to the Minnesota fans who are losing their team. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I don't know the exact coverage in the states. In Canada it is covered by TSN, so maybe ESPN will grab their coverage! I don't know! 
rec.sport.hockey	 Duh! He was making a joke about how long the Leafs would last in the playoffs. (Y'know, hit the courses in the off season). Sheesh... People are so quick to complain... 
rec.sport.hockey	 Sigh. This was written about the game NHLPA Hockey '93. Which does not have precise up-to-date rosters. Why don't people think before they post? Jeez... 
rec.sport.hockey	 Dale Hawerchuk and Troy Murray were both captains of the Jets when they were traded. (Murray this year in mid-season, Hawerchuk a few years ago in the off-season.) 
rec.sport.hockey	 I was wondering if any Star Trek TNG fans in this newsgroup knew of a possible relationship between the Bruins' players Douris & Moog and the Klingon names Duras and Worf (Son of Moog). I suppose it's a coincidence. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Tuesday, and the isles/caps game is going into overtime. what does ESPN do..... 
rec.sport.hockey	 Actually, fired-coach George Kingston was a third of the GM triumvirate. Now that the trio is now duo (Dean Lombardi and Chuck Grillo), the Sharks are already on their 3rd "office of the GM". And a 4th is likely to happen before September; they'll either add the new coach to the OofGM, or name a single GM. So your wager should be amended to read that Sharks are likely to have their 5th GM before the Panther's get their 2nd. Can't wait to see how the next season's NHL Guide and Record Book lists the GM history of the Sharks. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Sorry, Nelson, but you forgot to ask me. If you check the THN stats for Kansas City, you'll find that Larry has been playing for the games, having played in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3/26 and the 4/16 issue (1-3-4 with 13 PIM). Not exactly invisible. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Detroit is a very disciplined team. There's a lot of Europeans in Detroit which would make the game fast, so Toronto would have to slow the game down, which means drawing penalties, as a last resort anyway. Toronto will be a good team as soon as they get more good players. Toronto is just an average team, Detroit isn't Ballard screwed Toronto when he was owner. Everyone knows that. and it's going to take time for Toronto to become a real force. I expect Gilmour to be burnt out next year. He can't pull the whole team forever. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Showing a meaningless (relatively) baseball game over the overtime of game that was tied up with less than 3 seconds left on the clock? Gimme a break! Where does ESPN get these BRILLIANT decisions from? 
rec.sport.hockey	 Dale Hunter ties the game, scoring his third goal of the game with 2.7 seconds remaining in regulation. 
rec.sport.hockey	 We're probably stuck, as Mike Burger pointed out that the baseball deal was made far in advance of the NHL contract. WABC did the same thing; they were thankful that the Devils were wiped out by 9:30, because they had to switch over to Yankees baseball. The proof of the reasons for this is left to the reader ... 
rec.sport.hockey	 Ok, it seems that everyone else in canada was treated to the REAL ABC telecast while only the people on ROGERS TV in Surrey BC were treated to two channels with Don "I stink as a Commentator" Whitman doing the play-by-play. 
rec.sport.hockey	 The last name is Niedermayer, as in New Jersey's Scott's last name, because (you guessed it) they are brothers. But Rob Niedermayer is a center, not a defenseman. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Canada won 4-1 against Sweden! The last goal for Canada was at 19:59 in the 3rd period. Maybe you shouldn't go and get you another beer before the game is over and then post imaginary results... 
rec.sport.hockey	 Losers like us? You are the fucking moron who has never heard of the Western Business School, or the University of Western Ontario for that matter. Why don't you pull your head out of your asshole and smell something other than shit for once so you can look on a map to see where UWO is! Back to hockey, the North Stars should be moved because for the past few years they have just been SHIT. A real team like Toronto would never be moved!!! 
rec.sport.hockey	 OK, I'm sure that this has been asked 100's of times before, but I have wondered since I heard it... Where the hell did the nickname of the "Habs" come from for the Montreal Canadiens? 
rec.sport.hockey	 ESPN had the Houston Astros @ Chicago Cubs game scheduled for last night on the west coast.

rec.sport.hockey	 I'm in Edmonton, and while that's usually (or at least OFTEN) the case, here we were "treated" to the actual ABC telecast of the Kings/Flames game. I'm with whoever said it earlier - Don Witless (er, Whitman) is a poor commentator, and not just for hockey. Normally, if the Oilers were still playing (augh), I would turn off the sound and listen to the radio broadcast to get decent play-by-play announcing. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Ah yes. California. Did the San Francisco Bay area media report that Joe Montana is rumoured to be the leading candidate to replace fired San Jose Sharks coach George Kingston? Apparently Montana is not only coveted for his winning attitude, but as a playing coach he will be expected to quarterback the powerplay. 
rec.sport.hockey	 And Rick Tochett was the captain of the Flyers when traded to the Pens recently... 
rec.sport.hockey	 Did they move Probert back to defense? Why did I see him parking his ass in front of Potvin all night? Somebody is going to have to discipline Probert if the Leafs want to win the series. Perhaps a fresh Clark should hit the ice at the end of a long Probert shift and straigten him out for a while... 
rec.sport.hockey	 It's the "opening-game effect" maybe. Pros arrive late, nervousness for rookie WC players, and problems to get the lines clicking may make things hard to get it going against these "worse" nations. I'd guess that the better team you face in the opening game, the better it is, since the chances of an upset are greater then. 
rec.sport.hockey	 support a team in Miami is crazy; espaecially when you have really deserving cities without a team such as San Diego & Milwaukee. I wish the Panthers or whatever their name is well but if they can't sell to Hispanics, they're in deep doo-doo. Already, there are rumors that Tampa may move to Milwaukee. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I loved the ABC coverage. The production was excellent. The appearance was excellent. It had a sleek modern look. This was the first time I heard Thorne & Clement & I thought they were great. My only request is to leave Al Micheals out of this. He annoys me. I'm hoping this leads to a regular-season contract. My guess would be is that it will be roughly a weekly game from Feb.-April and then the playoffs. I envy you Canadians with your TSN & CBC. Maybe I'll get a dish to pick up Canadian TV. How much are those things, BTW?

rec.sport.hockey	 United States Coverage: Sunday April 18 N.J./N.Y.I. at Pittsburgh - 1:00 EDT to Eastern Time Zone ABC - Gary Thorne and Bill Clement 
rec.sport.hockey	 I was watching the Detroit-Minnesota game last night and thought I saw an octopus on the ice after Ysebaert scored to tie the game at two. What gives? (is there some custom to throw octopuses on the ice in Detroit?) 
rec.sport.hockey	 Let's start over. I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender. I'd take Soderstrom right now. What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1 netminder. The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than that after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records are similar. And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as the most disappointing player on the Flyers this season. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Tom Barrasso wore a great mask, one time, last season. He unveiled it at a game in Boston. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Wow. So that's probably the reason why current assistant coach Drew Ramenda hinted that he won't be back. Thanks for the news, Mikko; can you (or any of our Finnish netters) comment on Tichonov? 
rec.sport.hockey	 No no no!!! It's a squid! Keep the tradition alive! (Kinda like the fish at UNH games....) 
rec.sport.hockey	 UPI Clarinet has just relayed a "scoop" from the Toronto Sun (or was that Star?

rec.sport.hockey	 Actually, what I think has become more evident, is that you are determined to flaunt your ignorance at all cost. Jagr did not have a better season than Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of hockey knowledge. Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Do you have a basis for this claim? Try these stats (taken from Playboy Magazine June 1989): 
rec.sport.hockey	 The rumour was basically everywhere in Toronto based on reports that Keenan has told both San Jose and Philadelphia that he was no longer interested in pursuing further negotiations with either team. 
rec.sport.hockey	 The Hawks win!! Jermey Roenick scored his 50 th goal and the Hawks put the Leafs in their place, the losers column. If the Leafs can not even beat the Hawks in a match that had little or no meaning I will hate to see them against the Wings. 
rec.sport.hockey	 It is a long standing good luck Redwing's tradition to throw an octopus on the ice during a Stanley Cup game. They say it dates back to '52 at the Olympia when the Wings became the 1st team (I think) to sweep the cup in 8 games. A lot hardet to throw one from Joe Louis seats than from the old Olympia balcony, though. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I would appreciate it if you would not refer to Mr. Maynard by his initials. Thanks, see you in the Norris finals.

rec.sport.hockey	 Well I think it in 1969 the Montreal Canadians finished 1st (although there was no President's cup in those days) and missed the playoffs in 1970. I do recall that the 1970 playoff picture wasn't decided until the final day, when the NY Rangers defeated the RedWings. The tie-breaker was the number of goals for (if I remember correctly), so the Rangers played with an empty net for the entire game. Some Hab loyalists accused the Wings of 'throwing' the game to keep them out, but as I recall, Gordie and Delvecchio had the flu, so coach Sid Abel sat them out, and the Rangers swarmed the RedWings most of the night. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Just heard on the news that Mike Keenan formerly of the Blackhawks, Flyers, and General of a Siberian Prison has just signed to coach the Rangers. The Rangers, who won the President's Cup last year have slipped just a bit at the end of the season and are destined to finish last behind the lowly Flyers. The Flyers' fans are going to be disappointed on Keenans decision, because they were very interested in him. Oh well. 
rec.sport.hockey	 If the Islanders beat the Devils tonight, they would finish with identical records. Who's the lucky team that gets to face the Penguins in the opening round? Also, can somebody list the rules for breaking ties. 
rec.sport.hockey	 After reading some of the reports of possible NHL moves to Milwaukee or that Milwaukee should have an NHL team, I thought I'd pass along a story I heard recently. This is second hand, so I don't know how true it is, but I have no reason to doubt it either. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Why do you say this? As of now, the Pens and Bruins have played the same number of games, and given up the same number of goals. They are tied for the third and fourth best defenses in the league, behind Chicago first and Toronto second. The Pens' weak spot is defense? Only by comparison to their offense, which is second in the league to Detroit. But the Pens are no weaker on defense and goaltending than the Bruins are; that is, they are both very strong. 
rec.sport.hockey	 According to the hockey gurus over at ESPN, should the Islanders win tonite the two teams will have the same record, but the Devils will be playing the Penguins. This is because the Islanders have won the season series against the Devils. I think the rules for deciding a tie breaker include: 
rec.sport.hockey	 Actually, the way I understand it, it is an octapus. Apparently, a number of years ago, a fan threw an octapus on the ice and the announcer said "Octapi will not occupy the ice" or something like that, and it's happened ever since. The fans cheer those who pick up the dead octapus with their hands, and boo those who use a shovel. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I am not sure about the tie breaker rules. However, I think if the Islanders win (Oh God, Please, Please let them win), the Islanders win the series against NJ and advances to third. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I think Jagr did he probably had a better point per minute ice time- stats don't exist to properly analyze this and he had a substancially better +/-. 
rec.sport.hockey	 from Dean: In other TV news, the Penguins announced yesterday that they will have 3 fewer broadcast TV games, and will have 22(!) games on some sort of subscription / pay-per-view system. Yuck. 
rec.sport.hockey	 As a person who has rarely even SEEN Don Cherry and doesn't know anything about him, I don't know whether it is just this area (Pittsburgh) of the USA that is "deprived" of his broadcasts or whether he's a Canadian thing altogether. Seriously, what is he all about? I know he was a coach at one time, and from the volume of posts about him, SOMEONE surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow, but my question is, what is the deal with him? Secondly, are the comments of his that I read about on the net merely flame bait, or do people actually take him seriously? I gotta tell you, from what I see, he really sounds like an ass. Let me know - maybe I'm missing something. 
rec.sport.hockey	 It was great to hear that UMass is bringing back hockey! It reminded me that a couple of years ago there was talk that both Bimidgi (sp?) and Mankato State trying to upgrade their programs to Div. 1 status. I also seem to remember that they had some trouble with new NCAA rule about just who was allowed to compete at the Div. 1 level. Was that ever resolved? Also, I was just wondering if there is ANY college hockey east of Colorado (Alaska excepted). With the new popularity of hockey on the west coast, I would expect there to be some interest building at the collegiate levels too. Anyone heard anything? James Old, e-mail JOLD@vma.cc.nd.edu 
rec.sport.hockey	 Perish the thought...but you know, you may be right, at least as far as MAJOR LEAGUE professional sports teams go. They all seem to be becoming BIG MONEY games, much more so than at any previous time. To think that if I am ever able to move back home several years from now, all that may be there is an AHL team, at best...SIGH. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I'm the keeper of the stats for a family hockey pool and I'm looking for daily/weekly email servers for playoff stats. I've connected with the servers at J.Militzok@skidmore.EDU and wilson@cs.ucf.edu. I'm still sorting these two out. 
rec.sport.hockey	 CYT ; CYT : Wasn't Ron Francis captain of the Whalers when he was traded to CYT : Pittsburgh? 
rec.sport.hockey	 All these people who send in their polls should take a closer look at NJD, they are a very deep team, with two very capable goalies, and excellent forwards and defensemen. Shooter in Richer, an all around do it all in Todd, chef Stasny-master of a thousand dishes, power play captain-Stevens. Take a look at the numbers, or play with them and see for yourselves. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Way back in the early years (~50's) it took 8 wins to garner the Stanley Cup. Soooooo, a couple of local fish mongers (local to the Joe Louis Arena, that is) started the tradition of throwing an octopi onto the ice with every win. After each victory, one leg would be severed before the octopus found its way to the ice. (They are dead by the way.) It was a brilliant marketing strategy to shore up the demand for one of their least popular products. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Does anyone recieve annoying email from Roger Maynard whenever they post an article telling them to leave him alon and stop posting to the group?? These emails are filled with insults- more than are usual in Roger's posts and have little if any hockey info. I have recieved two in the last 2 days. I am just wondering if I am special or Roger trys to bully everyone who disagrees with him. 
rec.sport.hockey	 But ultimately their hockey philosophies are like night and day... Keenan believes in pressuring the opposition and taking the initiative (within the limits of his system)...while Roger has a reactive hockey philosophy...which is why Messier will be able to and has played for Keenan, but thought Roger's way was a sure loser. 
rec.sport.hockey	 It is meaningless to compare one player's plus/minus statistic with another players' out of the context of the role and the playing time of the players involved. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Local to the Joe Louis Arena? You mean local to Olympia Stadium, where Red Wings games were played until fairly recently (early 80s comes to mind). As far as I know, the rest of the post is basically correct. If what you meant by local was simply Detroit and I'm being incredibly picky, okay, sorry about that. 
rec.sport.hockey	 if the guy isn't a regular goalie or he is retired, please include the team! Thanks for your time, and keep on sending in those votes! 
rec.sport.hockey	 You can't be serious! I and many of my colleagues have not received any bad e-mails from Roger, in fact, Roger happens to have answered most if not all of my hockey questions and curiosities, so before you start flaming at me or Roger, better re-consider your nasty attitude towards Roger and the like! 
rec.sport.hockey	 Roberts played in last night game against the Sharks and got a goal (38th) and an assist. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Okay, here's the down side of the ESPN deal: no additional coverage. With a split contract, SCA could have at least gotten at leftovers like Canucks-Jets, Caps-whoever and Red Wings-Leafs (or whoever else is playing). 
rec.sport.hockey	 Oh, excuse me for wasting the bandwidth, but I was referring to the original incident, not the recent skirmish which occurred this past month. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I have been to all 3 Isles/Caps tilts at the Crap Centre this year, all Isles wins and there is no justification for Vukota and Pilon to play for the Isles. Vukota is absolutely the worst puck handler in the world!! He couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a banjo!! Al must remember a few years back when Mick scored 3 goals in one period against the Caps in a 5-3 Isles win. I was there and was astonished as was the rest of the crowd. Wake-up Al!!! Years later he's gotten worse. He's a cheap shot artist and always ends up getting stupid/senseless penalties. I think he would make a good police officier!!! 
rec.sport.hockey	 You should be ashamed to call yourself an Ulf Samuelson fan. Anybody who plays the way he does, does not belong in the NHL. There have been cheap shot artists through the history of the game, but a lot of them have been talanted players. Bobby Clarke, Kenny Linsemen, Pie McKenzie, Chris Chelios etc.. but nobody has been out right as dirty a cheapshot coward as Ulf. Violence in hockey has got to be curbed and players like (Should have been a Women) Samuelson don't belong. When players like Ulf, who's main purpose is to injure the better players in the league is allowed to continue, and the league won't stop it, the players should. A Christian Pro 1000 aluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely. If the Bruins get a chance to meet Pittsburgh in the near future, you can bet Neely will have his day. The sight of watching Ulf turtle up like the coward he is, is worth almost as much as a Stanely Cup. This wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingers in the game. If you are to remove Ulf Samuelson from the lineup, the Penguins would not even notice he's gone. He's an eyesore on the game of hockey. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Speaking of Roger, where is his comments from last nights game. You have to admit he can make a nothing game sound like it was game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals. Roger pushes the Leafs so much it even bothers me, a long time supporter but he does have a good overall idea of the game. Wow I just gave R.M a compliment, guess I better stop it with the Rye + Water before I give him another.. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Never was? Probably. Is not now? Debatable. What other valid test can you think of besides the final standings or divisional playoff winner? What do you propose, a worthless vote like they do in college football? What a joke! 
rec.sport.hockey	 Not necessarily the most misleading, but you are right, it definitely needs to be taken in the proper perspective. A shining example is if you look at the Penguins individual +/-, you will find very few minuses. That only makes common sense, since they didn't lose many games. 
rec.sport.hockey	 I can't believe that the NY Rangers would force its players to go to Binghamtom to play in the AHL playoffs instead of letting them represent their countries in the World Championships. 
rec.sport.hockey	 The FLYERS blew a 3-0 lead over the Buffalo Sabres in the second period, but Kevin Dineen's 7th career hat trick powered them to their 7th consecutive win, 7-4 over the Sabres who have now lost 7 in a row. Alexander Mogilny led the comeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at 3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots on goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny and LaFontaine all night.

Add to this that Neilsen might return as an assistant coach [Gerald, what'd I say earlier today??], and Roger conferred with Jaffe on the hiring. This hiring by Jaffe went over the head of MSG, Inc. (Par. subsidiary) head Bob Gutkowski and over the head and the protests of Pres./GM Neil Smith. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Well, I will have to change the scoring on my playoff pool. Unfortunately I don't have time right now, but I will certainly post the new scoring rules by tomorrow. Does it matter? No, you'll enter anyway!!! Good! 
rec.sport.hockey	 I think that they go to divisional records before goals, but I could be wrong, too. 
rec.sport.hockey	 The first time I heard this piece of news was on the post game radio interview here in Jyvaskyla. That was the bronze medal game in the SM-liiga which Tichonov's team Porin Assat (the Aces of town Pori:) lost. Vasili, the son of Victor Tichonov (the famous Soviet coach), said that for a long time the Sharks have been persuading him to take the assistant coach post. But he wants to be the head coach where ever he goes. He definitely won't be coaching Assat anymore (after three? seasons). I don't know why. 
rec.sport.hockey	 Nolan) says: If the Islanders beat the Devils tonight, they would finish with identical records. Who's the lucky team that gets to face the Penguins in the opening round? Also, can somebody list the rules for breaking ties. As I recall, the Penguins and Devils tied for third place last year with identical records, as well. Poor Devils -- they always get screwed. Yet, they should put a scare into Pittsburgh. They always do! Pens in 7.

sci.crypt	 There are many Urban Legends (maybe this ought to be in the Crypt FAQ?) about what is actually sufficient to clear or declassify magnetic media when used for classified data. Here is some information "from the horse's mouth". 
sci.crypt	 BTW I have not been able to get pgp to produce a signature that I can attatch to the end of this message. What is the procedure? Thanks. 
sci.crypt	 I hate to follow up to my own posting, but I should perhaps clarify some things so I won't get flamed. 
sci.crypt	 After IBM had invented the DES and the NBS had advertised for proposals, but before IBM had decided to respond, I argued strenuously that they should not; they should keep it proprietary. 
sci.crypt	 With regard to your speculations on NSA involvement in the creation of PKP, I find that it fails the test of Occam's butcher knife. Never attribute to conspiracy what can be explained by forthright greed. 
sci.crypt	 This assumes the person is using the hardware debug instruction of an X86 type processor. It can be negated by NOP'ing the clear debug instruction, or by running the code on a machine simulator, like one I wrote as a senior project in college. It can bypass and trace practically anything one could write in software. Kind of like being on a Star Trek Holideck :-). 
sci.crypt	 I got a number of requests for code. So, here it is. Its written in 80x86 ASM. Borland TASM will do. 
sci.crypt	 Legal or not, I've seen it done. Phone records were obtained in order to *establish* probable cause, rather than as a result of it. In other words, for a fishing expedition. 
sci.crypt	 This actually supports Bill's speculation - IF there is a backdoor in RSAREF and IF PKP is supported secretly by the NSA, then it is more than natural that they will welcome ANY public-key implementation that uses RSAREF and will strongly oppose themselves against ANY implementation that doesn't. 
sci.crypt	 Uh, I'm afraid that your information is slightly out of date... PKWare has obtained a license to export their program to the whole world, except a very limited list of countries... Draw your own conclusions about the strength of the algorithm... :-) 
sci.crypt	 It is MUCH easier, faster, and probably even more secure to use Norton Utilties 6.0 (I'm talking IBM PC here) and to tell WipeInfo to (a) clean the free disk space and (b) clean the slack space at the end of the files. Use to Government standard option for more careful overwriting... 
sci.crypt	 My speculation does not include or depend upon a trapdoor in RSAREF. I do not believe that RSA would consent to such. 
sci.crypt	 The law is much worse than worthless. It gives police the power to put innocent people in jail because they (the police) find something they don't understand. Most police don't know what the return key does, never mind the difference between a core file and classified military secrets. 
sci.crypt	 People have been encrypting notes in their notebooks for hundreds of years -- maybe over a thousand. It's a long tradition dating at least back to the alchemists. 
sci.crypt	 Better yet, instead of thrashing around on the DOS file system, take it a step further. Write yourself a minimal "file system" program that is used to create/delete files, en/decrypt them to ramdisk, list a directory. Put the util, password protected, on a floppy. 
sci.crypt	 For your application, what you can do is to encrypt the real-time clock value with a secret key.

sci.crypt	 Haven't you read any of Noam Chomsky's works? A widely used information net outside the control of the 'right people' is unthinkable. Hundreds of billions of dollars will be spent to wipe it out, sorry, 'regulate and order it' once the major media and poitical powers wake up to the efect it can have.

sci.crypt	 CALL FOR PAPERS The Internet Society Symposium on Network and Distributed System Security 
sci.crypt	 But that's just the problem. There is no such thing as "MIME-Formatted". By analogy, MIME is a content-labelling standard for the box, not a specification for the contents themselves. It provides a standard for "like-minded" individuals to exchange mail containing an agreed-upon data format.

sci.crypt	 Also not a lawyer, etc. but if I remember correctly the Contempt of Court business is used in order to compel cooperation with what is (perhaps questionably, different issue) the legitimate business of that court. Quite literally the party is found guilty of holding the court "in contempt". Now, the original scheme as suggested here would be to have the key disappear if certain threatening conditions are met. Once the key is gone there is no question of Contempt of Court as there is nothing to compell, the key is no longer there to be produced. 
sci.crypt	 Well, it now seems obvious what Professor Denning was doing last fall when this key escrow trial balloon was raised! 
sci.crypt	 I have a bunch of questions about the encryption scheme referenced in the Subject of this message. What is the relative data privacy provided by the above sequence as compared with straight DES? Does the addition of compression then encrypting make the cyphertext significantly harder to crack using current methods than straight DES? Would running crypt after DES provide greater data privacy? Is it important to remove the (constant) compress header before encryption? Thank you, net, for your wisdom. 
sci.crypt	 This document is in the anonymous ftp directory at NIST. Looks to me like the other shoe has dropped. 
sci.crypt	 Lets carry this one step further. Suppose the text of the key is in itself conclusive evidence of the SAME CRIME for which the encrypted material is further evidence. I find myself envisaging a scenario like this: 
sci.crypt	 A nice formulation for the introduction of the first encryption devices with built-in trapdoors - just like the Feds wanted... 
sci.crypt	 It looks like Dorothy Denning's wrong-headed ideas have gotten to the Administration even sooner than we feared. It's time to make sure they hear the other side of the story, and hear it loudly! 
sci.crypt	 Yes -- my error -- you will need the DIFF between the standard console.h and console.c supplied with Symantec's THINK C 5.0.4 and the specially modified one that works with MacPGP 2.2. 
sci.crypt	 I am eager to hear the legal theory behind restricting exchange of cryptographic data and encrypted messages, given the first admendment; the theory behind regulating the *personal* encryption of one's personal *thoughts and feelings* seems even less tenable. 
sci.crypt	 What is the expected run time (+/- a factor of 10) on a 486DX/50 using the best known algorithm for finding the shortest path solution for Rubicks Cube from a randomly chosen position? 
sci.crypt	 Note: The following was released by the White House today in conjunction with the announcement of the Clipper Chip encryption technology. 
sci.crypt	 Though some may argue about the nose of the camel, it's worth noting that the government proposal is limited to scrambled telephony. If it is only used for that purpose, and does not extend to electronic mail or file encryption, then it IS an improvement over the current mass-produced standard civilian technology which, with a few exceptions, is limited to easy-to-break inverters. 
sci.crypt	 Presumably, the key split is so that no one group controls the privacy of the key, and that it would be infeasible to illicitly gain access from both agents. 
sci.crypt	 How can the government tell which encryption method one is using without being able to decode the traffic? i.e., In order to accuse me of using an unauthorized strong encryption technique they would have to take both keys out of escrow, run them against my ciphertext and "draw a blank". 
sci.crypt	 Hmmm. "Check your facts." Good advice. Let's check Mr. Cain's facts a bit, shall we? 
sci.crypt	 I somehow started to doubt technical competence of the people who designed the system. Why on the Earth split the 80-bit key in 40-bit parts to keep them in escrow separately (having 40 bit and large volumes of data voice links produce it should be relatively easy to break it) when they simply could keep 80-bit sequences in N (N=2) independent places and then XOR all the partial keys to get the actual key (N-1 sequences should obviously be selected randomly and Nth is the actual key XOR-ed with the random sequences). 
sci.crypt	 Getting rid of the keys is actually pretty easy to do automatically on a communications link, as opposed to storage where the keys have to be retained somehow as long as the owner wants to be able to retrieve the data. 
sci.crypt	 Okay, let's suppose that the NSA/NIST/Mykotronix Registered Key system becomes standard and I'm able to buy such a system from my local radio shack. Every phone comes with a built in chip and the government has the key to every phone call. I go and buy a phone and dutifully register the key. 
sci.crypt	 Quite interesting. How does the US administration intend to persuade non - US governments to let the NSA eavesdrop on them? Or should U.S. companies install these chips in communication systems sold abroad without the customer's knowedge or consent, or not at all? 
sci.crypt	 I was thinking about this, also. It's quite possible the system transmits, in clear, the serial number of the device being used. That way they can start a tap, get the serial number, and use the warrant for the first tap to get the key. 
sci.crypt	 As of yet, there has been no description of the general principles behind the Clipper proposal. For example, is this a public key system or a private key system? If the latter, then I don't see how the system could work (given that the keys are tied to the device and not the person). 
sci.crypt	 Great... nice choice of bad guys to convince everyone how "bad" unrestricted encryption is. Why not use a child molester instead? Of course, the word *suspect* is never used here, so I guess these people have already been convicted and are operating this drug ring from their jail cells. 
sci.crypt	 Without real technical details, it's hard to answer this question. But suppose they already *are* XORing the two 40-bit parts to produce only 40 bits of real key material? Maybe they're using the exportable version of RC2...? :-) 
sci.crypt	 Here is an article I found today in comp.security.misc. I'll send my reply in a separate post to comp.off.eff.org so thayt you guys can get original text. Have fun! ;( 
sci.crypt	 This may be a stupid question, but how does the government know which keys to ask for? 
sci.crypt	 The stragegy of the government is interesting. The real fear comes from them doing more than this. 
sci.crypt	 About 18 months ago, I heard a report on NPR about a 900-number "1-900-STO-PPER" or some such, for placing untraceable calls. You call them, and on "bong" tone dial the number you want to call; they told the NPR interviewer that nothing short of a court order (which they'd fight) would make them release their records. 
sci.crypt	 I'm quite astonished, shocked, and appalled at this serious frontal assault on emerging American freedoms. The Clinton administration nor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever in regulating cryptography. To do so is tantamount to regulating `acceptable' speech, and is blatantly unconstitutional. Perhaps we should rename this year `1984' in honor of such an illustrious proposal. Let the Crappy Chip live in infamy, and the adminstration receive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure. 
sci.crypt	 Besides being an infringement on our civil liberties (not the subject in this post), the name "Clipper Chip" seems very confusable with the "Clipper" chip of Intergraph. 
sci.crypt	 I don't know if this is still true, but at one time Coca-Cola took elaborate measures to keep the formula secret. For instance, several plants in different cities each made one of six partial concentrates, which were then shipped back-and forth and remixed in a complicated scheme so that no single plant made the whole formula. By now, I would guess that PepsiCo's chemists would have reverse-engineered it; can't be all that exotic. Actually I prefer Pepsi anyhow; in about 3 minutes I'm gonna put money into a Pepsi vending machine... 
sci.crypt	 The Clipper Chip will have no effect. Current generation PCs, portable and desktop, all have analog voice - digital voice and vice versa capabilities. So, I only need a modem output to the telephone, and I can interpose any encryption screen on my voice traffic I want. 
sci.crypt	 This doesn't handle superencrypted traffic. If the clipper doesn't impose any unfortunate performance side-effects there's no reason not to use it to superencrypt a stream of triple-DES encrypted traffic. That way your traffic looks "normal" and perhaps anyone desiring to listen in won't even bother, since they know nobody's going to really trust crypto that has classified internals for important stuff. 
sci.crypt	 WRONG: I don't think even PKP claims this one. It is not unlawful to distribute code implementing RSA. It appears to be unlawful to use it, so I agree with your last sentence. 
sci.crypt	 Stupid me. I believed the Democrats stood for principles of personal privacy while it was the Neanderthal Republicans that wanted into every aspect of our lives. 
sci.crypt	 Then they'll probably also want to start tracking the customer lists of people purchasing SoundBlaster and similar boards, which can be configured with the use of some code and a modem, to act as a pretty decent digital-encrypting telephone. It's expensive, though, and kind of awkward. I don't know any drug lords, but I'm sure they'd favor something tappable over something secure as long as the user interface is nice. 
sci.crypt	 Oh great. Wonderful news. Nobody can listen in--except the feds. You believe that the feds offer the least threat to liberty of anyone, and I'm sure I do too. 
sci.crypt	 Yeah, but does he intend to prevent the private sector from developing other applications that are equally effective in assuring privacy, but do not have a key escrow system? 
sci.crypt	 More than shocking. What this says to me is no less than that government is very interested in monitoring the public. This does more than scare me, it mortifies me. 
sci.crypt	 If Brad's analysis is correct, it may offer an explanation for why the encryption algorithm is being kept secret. This will prevent competitors from coming out with Clipper-compatible phones which lack the government- installed "back door." The strategy Brad describes will only work as long as the only way to get compatible phones is to have ones with the government chips. 
sci.crypt	 It's very possible, even likely, that the serial number of the invididual chip is broadcast either in a standard encrypted format, so that all the big brother types need to do is listen to the traffic, get a court order (generally just by saying that they think you may be a crook) and go to it. r to listen in, they only receive gobbledly-gook because the secret key registered under my name isn't the right one. 
sci.crypt	 If there is anyone attending the ISSA conference in Arlington, VA next week, I would appreciate them getting in touch with me. 
sci.crypt	 The actual algorithm is classified, however, their main thrust here is for cellular phones, and encryption is only over the radio end, not end to end, I think. End to end will come later. 
sci.crypt	 Let's assume, for the moment, that the system really is secure unless you get both halves of the encryption key from the two independent escrow houses. Let's say you even trust the escrow houses -- one is the ACLU and the other is the EFF. (And I'm not entirely joking about those two names) 
sci.crypt	 It occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you, and the escrow houses release your code to the cops, your code is now no longer secure.

sci.crypt	 Here's a simple way to convert the Clipper proposal to an unexceptionable one: Make it voluntary. 
sci.crypt	 Getting the court order to reveal the key *also* makes decipherable all *past* conversations (which may be on tape, or disk, or whatver), as I understand the proposal. I could be wrong, but I've seen no mention of "session keys" being the escrowed entities.

sci.crypt	 Who makes them forget and destroy all copies of the key once they've decided you're not a criminal today? Just curious. 
sci.crypt	 Well, almost.... If I only had to solve the problem for myself, and were willing to have to type in a second password (the secret key) whenever I logged in, it could work. However, I'm trying to create a solution that anyone can use, and which, once installed, is just as effortless to start up as the non-solution of just using xhost(1) to control access. I've got religeous problems with storing secret keys on multiuser computers. 
sci.crypt	 Does anyone know of a non-word password generator program for PC's?? i.e. it will produce a nonsense word but still be pronouncible. e.g. lisgollan 
sci.crypt	 True in theory. In practice? The technology of cellular phones will probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext without the key. If the frequency path depends on they key, as I understand it to, it *could* be made effectively impossible to record. 
sci.crypt	 A remark I heard the other day is beginning to take on increasingly frightening significance. The comment was made that "In other parts of the world the Democrats [note the big "D would be known as Socialists" 
sci.crypt	 Stupid me. I believed the Democrats stood for principles of personal privacy while it was the Neanderthal Republicans that wanted into every aspect of our lives. Clinton is just more clever than the other guy. Looks like gun control for privacy technology. One small step at a time. 
sci.crypt	 Just a random passing thought, but can anyone cite a documented use of encryption technology by criminals and terrorists. (Excluding the Iran-Contra Gang) 
sci.crypt	 Fascinating. Most of the content of the White House announcements was in what was *not* said. It gives us almost nothing of value, threatens to take away a lot, and does it with a sincere smile on its face, and the nice friendly word "Management". 
sci.crypt	 rather unusual technology, such as sealed boxes of paper, or destructive read memory, rather than typical computer databases, which is fun for a database of hundreds of millions of keys. 
sci.crypt	 The computer, err, government, is your friend. Have a nice day (under penalty of law). 
sci.crypt	 And anybody who can get the keys from the escrow company. This is a database that's going to take plenty of updating - they think they can keep it secure? Please... and that's just primary, not secondary sources, such as police using the key under a warrant. Would anyone be surprised if they just "neglected" to erase the key if it turned out they couldn't nail you on anything? 
sci.crypt	 Nice to think, but naive. The fact is that millions of people today are sending highly confidential information over unencoded, easy to receive cellular phones. They figure the chances of being heard are small, so they risk it. 
sci.crypt	 Excuse me? This has *already* happened. There's a couple of humps in the tent already. Ask the folks at Qualcomm what became of the non-trivial encryption scheme they proposed for use in their CDMA digitial cellular phone standard? There *already* are restrictions in place. 
sci.crypt	 Hm, could another court try you via a bypass of the double jeopardy amendment like they are doing in the LAPD trial? Ie your judge is a state judge, and then a federal judge retries you under the justification that its not the same trail. 
sci.crypt	 I suggest that you refrain from such insults unless and until you can produce some evidence to back up that claim. Given the measures proposed or passed in the last year or so, such as S.266 and the scanner ban, her proposal need not be any more than her own attempt at a technical solution. It's entirely possible, in fact, that it was the notion of splitting the key, which came up in the debate, that softened this proposal. 
sci.crypt	 53 seconds to hash 20M of core (I bet I know who the source of your information is!). No, it's not acceptable if it's part of your login process. But if you are going to use network traffic as the source of pseudo-random information, do the right thing and pass it through a cryptographic hash function, not a compressor. Aside from the fact that it will run faster, it will give better results (think of a cryptographic hash as a function that "distills" randomness). Something along the lines of etherfind -t -x -n | dd bs=1k count=10 2/dev/null | md5 should do the trick. -t gives you timestamps, and the lack of -u makes sure that dd does not get ten lines as opposed to ten K. The above takes a couple of seconds on a lightly-loaded ethernet. 
sci.crypt	 Lets hope. Years ago a Telecom tech refused to tap a line unless he saw the warrant. The managment type who told him to do it fired him. The appeal against the dismissal was lost. 
sci.crypt	 Try reading between the lines David - there are *strong* hints in there that they're angling for NREN next, and the only conceivable meaning of applying this particular technology to a computer network is that they intend it to be used in exclusion to any other means of encryption. 
sci.crypt	 Under the relevant federal law, 18 USC sec. 2518(8)(d), the authorizing judge must notify the targets within 90 days after the tap period (with extensions) expires. This is the "normal" practice. 
sci.crypt	 Encrypting just the radio link doesn't make sense to me. That means the telco has to do the decryption, and hence they need the keys. How are they going to be kept secure? 
sci.crypt	 Not to pick on Mr. May in particular, of course, but isn't this kind of the domino theory? When one little country falls, its neighbor will surely follow, and before you know it, we're all mining salt in Siberia for not turning in our Captain Crunch Secret Decoder Rings. 
sci.crypt	 A Unix tool of cryptographic significance is available for anonymous ftp. 
sci.crypt	 I've seen PGP 2.2 mentioned for the Mac platform. I use 2.0 on MS/DOS. Is there a 2.2 for MS/DOS? If so, a site or two that has it available (I'd need executables, although source would be nice to review). What was "fixed" or changed from 2.0 2.2? 
sci.crypt	 Yes it is. From the National Film Board of Canada. Guy gthomas@native-ed.bc.ca 
sci.crypt	 I'd *desparately* prefer it if we didn't rehash the same arguments that went on ad infinitum last time. That's especially true for the traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now. 
sci.crypt	 This announcement is somewhat disconcerting; it doesn't do anything evil in and of itself, but bodes badly for the future of open algorithms and standards in information security. I won't start panicking until/unless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited, but I'm a little anxious. (No doubt it won't be long before someone posts explaining how this just a small part of some far-ranging and long-lived NSA-PKP-IRS-FBI-CIA-HandgunControlInc-Clinton conspiracy to subvert freedom, democracy, and mathematics.) My feeling is that the administration probably isn't that worried about things like DES and RSA and PGP and RIPEM, since they'll never be used by a group much wider than us computer geeks. 
sci.crypt	 I change login passwords every couple of months. I sure would suck if I had to get a new sparc station everytime I wanted to do this. It seems that this is what they expect you to do if you want to routinely change your password on your phone. I'm sure the government contractor doesn't mind, but a system where you can cheaply change keys (DES) has inherent security advantages, regardless of the algorithms involved. 
sci.crypt	 From the limited details released so far, It seems that the clipper chip system must employ some sort of public key cryptography. Otherwise, the key management problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system unworkable. It probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes place at the start of each call. Thats how they would identify the private key in their data base? 
sci.crypt	 I agree. This is the danger I see, not the system itself. That is to say, this is a political issue, not a technical one. 
sci.crypt	 I saw this article posted in a local newsgroup. I haven't seen it, or any followup traffic relating to it in these groups or other groups which I subscribe to. So, I am posting it here so others can read it, check it out, and comment on it, and provide ideas for handling these sorts of things. 
sci.crypt	 Umm... I beg to differ with the phrase ``only conceivable meaning''. The SDNS protocols, for example, make explicit provision for multiple encryption systems, as does PEM. (And I'd love to see how they'd mandate this new system for PEM without disclosing it....) 
sci.crypt	 Clipper Chip is a response to the fact that there is no business or professional body in a position to establish a standard and provide chipsets to implement it for analog or digial transmission systems. 
sci.crypt	 I tried to mail Peter Boucher, who posted the question, but my e-mail bounced, so, apologies to thsoe who are not interested. trinomials are all of the form X**a + X**b + 1, where a Have you read: Bremner,A., On Trinomials of Type x$+n$-+Ax$+m$-+1. Math. Scand. 49(1981) pp. 145-155. Zbl. 458.12012. MR 83k:12002. 
sci.crypt	 Hear hear! I completely agree that we need to work quickly to establish alternatives to the government's Clinton Clipper. As Brad Templeton and others have noted, once the Clipper becomes ensconced in enough phones there will be enormous pressure to make it the *legal* standard, and it will become the "market* standard as well. (There is a lot of confusion in the proposal about whether the use of Clipper is mandated, about whether non-escrow alternatives will be allowed, etc.) 
sci.crypt	 with scanners, as compared to what the feds can do, and have done, to their targets?

sci.crypt	 I wish I could agree with you. Ask yourself this. Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least partially compromised? (Key escrows in this instance) Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly evaluated? (i.e. algorythm not publically released) The answer seems obvious to me, they wouldn't. There is other hardware out there not compromised. DES as an example (triple DES as a better one.) 
sci.crypt	 What they would need to do, though, is make sure that nobody has access to decent crypto in the first place. They probably can't tell Clippered voice from Clippered triple-DESed voice until they get their copy of your key. Any criminal who's going to use encryption will do it under cover of Clipper. The only way to avoid this will be to try to prohibit strong encryption. 
sci.crypt	 I'd lay long odds that it was the other way around. Clinton didn't just pull this plan out of any bodily orifices; the NSA has to have been working on it for years. While it's possible that Denning (and other prominent people) just happened to start arguing for such a system, it seems more likely that there was a suggestion involved. If this guess is wrong, I apologize. 
sci.crypt	 The message from the NIST about the clipper chip comes from the following address: 
sci.crypt	 brad@clarinet.com (Brad Templeton): }And yes, this has to be a public key system or it would be almost }impossible to handle. It might not be RSA, but that does not mean }that PKP doesn't get paid. Until 1997, PKP has the patent on the }general concept of public key encryption, as well as the particular }implementation known as RSA. 
sci.crypt	 Not at all. Two weeks ago I registered a concern about some programming that was being conducted by a student organisation here at the University of Texas at San Antonio. As a result, I was interrogated by the capus police, who also attempted to create a positive-identification file (photo, fingerprints, etc.). I refused to permit this, and filed a complaint with the University administration. The Vice-President for Business Affairs (the 'boss' of the campus police) stated that he had no interest in the legal/Constitutional implications of those actions. 
sci.crypt	 No. The LAPD officers were tried first by the State of California on charges of police brutality, and secondly by the Federal Government on depriving RK of his civil rights - a different crime.

sci.crypt	 If the data isn't there when the warrant comes, you effectively have secure crypto. If secret backups are kept...then you effectively have no crypto. Thus, this poster is essentialy arguing no crypto is better than secure crypto. 
sci.crypt	 This way to detect pre-encryption may be defeated ; one can do transformation of the spectrum of encrypted signal just by adding some pre-arranged (in the beginning of communication) function. I think so. Say, you can do FFT of your encrypted signal. Just thinking ... 
sci.crypt	 What follows is my opinion. It is not asserted to be "the truth" so no flames, please. It comes out of a background of 20 years as a senior corporate staff executive in two Fortune 50 companies. 
sci.crypt	 If the Administration is this far along, is it possible that the government been working on it for a while and has been using the Dennings to prime the pump, so to speak, or as the Judas goat? Whether paid off, just gullible, or what, doesn't really matter. 
sci.crypt	 I first heard rumors of a similar government proposal (in Risks Digest???) in 1987 or 1988. 
sci.crypt	 I have lurked here a bit lately, and though some of the math is unknown to me, found it interesting. I thought I would post an article I found in the Saturday, April 17, 1993 Toronto Star: 
sci.crypt	 I know that at least one person on that list says the first he heard of Clipper was in the Friday morning newspaper! And another has already fired off a letter of protest to NIST. 
sci.crypt	 It seems to me that all discussions about Clipper security are almost irrelevant - if I cannot choose the key, but have to use a key chosen for me by the foundry, the security of the WHOLE UNIVERSE OF USERS is as good (or as bad) as the security of VLSI Technologies Inc. 
sci.crypt	 2) The system is vulnerable to simple phone swapping attacks like this. Criminals will quickly figure this out and go to town. 
sci.crypt	 The Clipper chip is just the culmination of Dorthy Denning et all. But lets ignore that for the moment. 
sci.crypt	 It might pay to start looking at what this proposal might mean to a police agency. It just might be a bad idea for them, too. 
sci.crypt	 Don't forget, you are in the country that wouldn't let the Russians buy Apple II's because of security concerns. 
sci.crypt	 Following precedent in other areas, the government is likely to put a tax on encryption technology. Once the tax is imposed, it becomes a federal matter and suspicision of an unlicensed cryptographic tool will bring the BATF or FBI tossing grenades into your house. (The BATF appears to be the logical agency to enforce such regulations: federal control over alocohol, tobacco, and firearms is similary based on taxes.) 
sci.crypt	 I'm sure Dorothy Denning is an honest person and wouldn't lie to us. Simply think up a question to ask her about her involvement, but be very careful to phrase it in such a way that there can be no Jesuitical evasion or a true but wholly misleading answer. 
sci.crypt	 The dead giveaway is the repeated protestations that the new plan is aimed at "criminals", "drug dealers", "terrorists", etc. You'd think the tactic would be too obvious to trot out yet again after a decade of Sarah and the rest of the Brady Bunch using it to destroy the Second Amendment, but evidently the control nuts feel it will serve them one more time. 
sci.crypt	 I am not an expert in the cryptography science, but some basic things seem evident to me, things which this Clinton Clipper do not address. The all pertain to opportunites for abuse, and conclusions based on what I have seen the membership of this group (except for two notable persons) agree to. If anything bad is possible by the government in theory, it almost always ends up happening in fact. So the key is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE. Question authority, and remember power DOES corrupt. 
sci.crypt	 And if Richard Nixon had had this kind of toy, he wouldn't have had to send people into the Watergate. 
sci.crypt	 A few more sources are statistics on your filesystems (easily and quickly obtained) and the output from the "rusage" system call. 
sci.crypt	 As long as "you are on your own" means that you can use your own encryption, I'm sold. 
sci.crypt	 I am currently writing a paper on computer protocols security. I would appreciate your help. I currently have no insight into these topics except that they relate to security in multilevel security network. Please semd me any references, books, FAQs or contact persons names and Internet addresses. The topics I am interested in: 1. The "firewall gateway model" as implemented in Internet gateways. 2. Kerberos Authentication Service 
sci.crypt	 With E-Mail, if they can't break your PGP encryption, they'll just call up one of their TEMPEST trucks and read the electromagnetic emmisions from your computer or terminal. Note that measures to protect yourself from TEMPEST surveillance are still classified, as far as I know. 
sci.crypt	 Let me ask you this. Would you trust Richard Nixon with your crypto keys? I wouldn't. 
sci.crypt	 I received the following two notes from Martin Hellman with details on how Clipper will work. They are posted with his permission. The implications of some details are fascinating. 
sci.crypt	 Excuse me? This has *already* happened. There's a couple of humps in the tent already. Ask the folks at Qualcomm what became of the non-trivial encryption scheme they proposed for use in their CDMA digitial cellular phone standard? There *already* are restrictions in place. 
sci.crypt	 As John Gilmore has pointed out repeatedly, if you produce the infrastructure that would permit a police state to function, all that is required to suddenly find yourself living in one is a change of attitude on the part of the government. 
sci.crypt	 I know that at least one person on that list says the first he heard of Clipper was in the Friday morning newspaper! And another has already fired off a letter of protest to NIST. 
sci.crypt	 I think this to be inaccurate. One can buy TEMPEST equipment commercially. Even Macs. 
sci.crypt	 Short summary of what Bellovin says Hellman says the NSA says: There is a global key G, plus one key U_C for each chip C. The user can choose a new session key K_P for each phone call P he makes. Chip C knows three keys: G, its own U_C, and the user's K_P. The government as a whole knows G and every U_C. Apparently a message M is encrypted as E_G(E_{U_C}(K_P),C) , E_{K_P}(M). That's it. 
sci.crypt	 This appears to be generic calling upon the name of the anti-christ. Just for the hell of it, let's destroy this remark. Let us imagine that the executive branch actually could extract keys from the escrow houses without anyone knowing, or telling. Now what? Dick has 80 bits of data. What the hell's he gonna do with it? 
sci.crypt	 Being a browser of this group for some time, and being very concerned about the clipper chip proposal, I am hoping someone with more knowledge can help out. 
sci.crypt	 We might get further if we begin by accepting that the government really couldn't be bothered less about the political opinions of the right wing pro establishment types. Just about the only circumstances in which I could think that they would be interested in their political views would be to recruit them as spooks. They can be guaranteed to give the government line when it counts. In US history it has been the socialists such as myself who have been persecuted. 
sci.crypt	 There are some issues which come to mind when one considers the law enforcement aspects of the use of the Big Brother (Clipper) chip.' "The drug dealers and terrorists aren't going to let themselves be caught by using this type of encryption. In 1985 the New York Times reported that government investigators broke up a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated equipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to eavesdrop on the law-enforcement agents who were trying to arrest them. A Mr. Deely, an NSA official, said "There are a lot of medium-sized countries that would have been proud to have the signals intelligence operation of this group." For every John Gotti there are probably many more people who have the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure communications are. The press given to the Big Brother chip will only increase their numbers. Even if there is some benefit to law-enforcement through the use of Big Brother, it must be weighed against the constitutional and civil liberties questions involved. For example, in some areas of the world torture is used as an investigative tool by the local "law-enforcement" people. I suspect it is an effective means of obtaining information and shortening many investigations. It probably also helps keep the conviction rate high. The fact that the torture tool is not used in this country (even with a court order obtained by showing "probable cause") is because we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency and what is ethically and morally right. I think that the same question of expediency versus morality should come into play when considering the use of Big Brother. I vote for morality. I am quite disturbed by what I interpret as a veiled threat to prohibit the use of all encryption if this Big Brother chip is not put into wide spread use. After a quick reading of the White House press release I came away with that impression. To most of the American public, the word "hacker" has rightly or wrongly come to mean "high tech adolescent vandal". regarding this issue are intelligent, thoughtful individuals who have genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issues surrounding Big Brother. I hope that the use of Big Brother does not become mandatory and other encryption become illegal. I would hate to see this become some kind of high tech Volstead Act. The high speed digital communications revolution is coming at us with the speed of an SST. The times they are a changing, and just as IBM is learning that they can't do business the same way they have done it for the past 40 years, maybe NSA should evaluate another approach. EFF, who have correctly questioned the cryptographic strength of Big Brother, may need to send a stronger message out regarding the constitutional issues involved. Al Gore may want to think this one through a little more. And as for Dorothy Elizabeth Robling Denning: En quoi cela vous concerne, cheri? 
sci.crypt	 I was wanting to ask the same question Dan Bernstein asked--how does the Clipper chip exchange keys? If the public key is only 80 or 160 bits long, does anyone know of any public-key schemes that are secure with that key size? (Diffie-Hellman or maybe El Gamal, with p set to a constant value?) Presumably, the real scheme is something like: 
sci.crypt	 Yes, but they'll be encrypted with Cripple Chip encryption, the encryption algorithm so great it's TOP SECRET and so unbreakable they WON'T EVEN LET YOU LOOK AT IT! 
sci.crypt	 I don't know about classified, but I do seem to remember that unless you're authorized by the Govt, it's illegal to TEMPEST-shield your equipment. Besides, effective TEMPEST-shielding is much more difficult than you might think (hi Jim!). 
sci.crypt	 Here are some ideas for those of you who want to oppose the White House Clipper chip crypto initiative. I think this is going to be a tough measure to fight, since the Government has invested a lot of resources in developing this high-profile initiative. They are serious about it now. It won't be as easy as it was defeating Senate Bill 266 in 1991. 
sci.crypt	 Maybe I don't know enough to know what I am asking, but with millions of these things about, how could the algorythm possibly stay secret? Couldn't some clever hackers just grind the thing down layer by layer, and see how it worked? 
sci.crypt	 It just occurred to me why the algorithm is secret. If it were published, one could then build physically identical clone versions of the chip that would interoperate with official Clipper chips. But the cloner wouldn't provide the keys to the escrow houses. Hmmn. 
sci.crypt	 And in Russia, capitalists were persecuted for trading goods on the black market. And in the US, capitalist minded types are imprisoned and killed for things such as selling drugs, guns, pornography, and other victimless activities. It doesn't matter whether you are socialist or capitalist, power and control are central to government. Since citizens can't be trusted to run their own affairs, the government must watch them. (for their own good of course. I mean, with strong cryptography, citizens might <gasp! start to hide things from the IRS, sell drugs/guns/pornography, and that cannot be allowed!) 
sci.crypt	 Thus said djb@silverton.berkeley.edu (D. J. Bernstein): Short summary of what Bellovin says Hellman says the NSA says: There is a global key G, plus one key U_C for each chip C. The user can choose a new session key K_P for each phone call P he makes. Chip C knows three keys: G, its own U_C, and the user's K_P. The government as a whole knows G and every U_C. Apparently a message M is encrypted as E_G(E_{U_C}(K_P),C) , E_{K_P}(M). That's it. 
sci.crypt	 The following is available in some FTP archive somewhere, I insert my comments liberally throughout this demonic memo of Big Brotherdom: 
sci.crypt	 This is the one part that really scares me. Without the keys, it can likely be determined if a person is using the "State Approved" encryption method, and if not then that persons life is forfet, and the profits go to making more busts, and more profit. 
sci.crypt	 sizes, the rights of people to have their own standards, and the non-right of the gov. to regulate screw-threads...] 
sci.crypt	 I need to know the following information about the upcoming Crypto Conference; The address to submit articles, and the number of copies needed. Thanks, Jonathan DeMarrais jed@pollux.usc.edu 
sci.crypt	 A lot of us out here in the hinderland will trust the Japanese before we'll trust the NSA, the President, or those stupid Fortune 50 companies you're so proud of. 
sci.crypt	 I envision incorporation of new standart into various communication systems, thus making it prevalent on the market & therefore cheap. The way to do that may be detaching crypto chip from communication equipment. It seems logical to provide Clipper chip to the end-user not as a part of phone, fax, modem & like but in the form of smart-card compatible with various telecomm. products. Banks will encourage extensive use of new cards to make transactions by phone. Natural step will be to cross-reference this card to the person in the government databases - or else this new version of "wiretap proposal" make no sence at all; one wish to eavesdrop (spell.) on the particular person, not on the particular modem or phone. 
sci.crypt	 I've recently moved from Unix to a DOS box and have a number of files that I used crypt to "protect". Does anyone know of a DOS version of crypt? I've found one, but it insists on six letter keys and I used some shorter ones. Thanks for your help. -- Doug 
sci.crypt	 But, for all the wrongness of our attempt to correct it (VietNam, et. al.), the domino theory wasn't disproved at all. 
sci.crypt	 The cryptographic algorythm MUST be kept secret, or private individuals could make ClipperClones with which they could transmit messages which the feds would not have ready access to. This is clearly unacceptable. 
sci.crypt	 Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access. The telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant. That's the rule today. 
sci.crypt	 I take it you mean President Nixon, not private citizen Nixon. Sure. Nothing I'm doing would be of the slightest interest to President Nixon . 
sci.crypt	 This is a very curious thing to say. STU-IIIs (NSA-designed secure telephones cleared for classified traffic) are already readily available to law enforcement agencies. Word has it they're standard in every FBI office, for example. Something like several hundred thousand of these phones exist in all. They are clearly the US government standard. 
sci.crypt	 dwight tuinstra posts a very interesting message in which he comments on the effects of the Clipper chip on state and local police. Actually, reading between the lines, it could be a very good thing for civil liberties in one respect, since it will at least prevent cowboy cops and cowboy state and local agancies from reading your traffic if they tap it illegally. 
sci.crypt	 The description of the chip's operation evidently leaves out some of the key management aspects. Either the K_P is the secret key corresponding to a public key which is broadcast at message initiation, or it is the result of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange or something similar. Either way there must be some protocols beyond those described here. It isn't clear whether they are implemented in the Clipper wiretap chip or must be provided by other system components. 
sci.crypt	 Via K_P, of course. Nothing was said about where K_P comes from. It's the session key, though, and it's chosen however you usually choose session keys --- exponential key exchange, shared secret, RSA, etc. But however you choose it, the chip will apparently emit the escrow header when you do. 
sci.crypt	 I don't doubt that this will be the attitude of many corporate leaders. It's understandable--most corporate execs don't know much about cryptology, and it's easy to get taken in by someone peddling snake oil. And, the proposed scheme *is* a major improvement in telephone security to what exists now. 
sci.crypt	 Not necessarily. I've been thinking about this, and if this chip/scheme is to provide any real security, there must be some sort of key exchange, either using a public-key encryption scheme, or using a key exchange scheme like Diffie-Hellman. If there's an out-of-band transmission of a shared session key, then what protects that band from eavesdropping? If the phone company or some other online central authority generates a session key and sends it to both users, then what's the point of going to the trouble of having some complicated key-depositories? Just ask the phone company for a copy of the session key for each call. 
sci.crypt	 This isn't true. Today's criminals regularly use all sorts of unsafe methods, from cordless phones to cellular phones to plain old copper wire analog phones that you can put alligator clips on to plan and execute their crimes. 
sci.crypt	 No, the poster (me) has his brain in the wrong gear. As you can infer from the first sentence, I meant the consequences of no backup are *better* than the consequences of an easy to copy database. 
sci.crypt	 Perhaps one way of getting away from this cripple chip that the U.S. government seems to be pushing would be to come up with a good alternative. For example, how about a scheme using RSA, and some hybrid of DES-CFB and another strong stream cipher (Maybe IDEA-CFB)? This could be substantially the same as the cripple chip, except that instead of key-registration, the police could demand that you give up your secret key to them (with a court- issued warrant). Then, they could read the last few months of wiretapped messages you've sent, and assuming you've committed no crimes, you could generate a new key pair and go about your business. I find that I'd be willing to pay RSA for the right to use such a system, especially given the alternative. If you were unwilling to give up your secret key, then you'd probably stay in jail (has anyone got a real legal precedent for this?). This would allow court-issued warrants to be used to gather information on suspected criminals, but it couldn't be done in secrecy, and there would be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed keys. (Maybe someone from the law-enforcement or intelligent community will correct me, but this doesn't *seem* like such a big loss in terms of law-enforcement capabilities.) 
sci.crypt	 Oh? Hellman said ``each user will get to choose his or her own key.'' That's the key which I called K_P, the session key. According to Hellman, if Alice and Bob are communicating with the Clipper Chip, then Alice chooses ``her own key'' and Bob chooses ``his own key.'' This is incompatible with the suggestion that when Alice and Bob are talking, they use a _common_ K_P, chosen by classical or public-key approaches. 
sci.crypt	 Philip, I think your ideas are well taken and constructive. Thanks for articulating them in this forum. 
sci.crypt	 I recall seeing a post some time ago saying that if the details of an encryption scheme couldn't be revealed, then the encryption scheme is worthless. I believe the statement was in response to somebody saying that they had some new snazzy scheme, but the algorithm was a secret. 
sci.crypt	 The idea that foisting the Cripple Chip standard on US manufacturers would result in saying "Sayonara" to yet another high-tech market isn't technical, isn't in the least difficult to understand, and plays on a concern lots of people are worried about already.... 
sci.crypt	 Hi, I'm new to Internet, so this is a bit of a test message, so even a token reply would be very appreciated. 
sci.crypt	 The protocol/key-management description published so far is either incomplete or incorrect. It leaves me with no idea of how the system would actually _work_. I hope the CPSR FOIA request succeeds so that we get full details. 
sci.crypt	 Ah yes, don't anyone mention Ronald William Pelton[*], heh heh heh. How embarrassing. 
sci.crypt	 So if we subvert one of the two escrow agents, we only have a 40-bit space to search through... 
sci.crypt	 Have you read the applicable part of the Constitution and interpreted it IN CONTEXT? If not, please do so before posting this misinterpretation again. It refers to the right of the people to organize a militia, not for individuals to carry handguns, grenades, and assault rifles. 
sci.crypt	 I can buy a DES keysearch machine off the shelf now for approx $500K, but it is not sold by that name. Go buy a circuit emulation machine (eg. Quickturn) containing a bunch of FPGAs, (say 500 to 1000 3090's), and program each to be a DES search engine. Lets say 500 chips, running at 10Mhz = 5G tests/sec. Time is 14e6 sec max = 23 weeks, 12 weeks average. Can't wait that long? Buy a bigger machine. 
sci.crypt	 There was an interesting column on the editorial page of the Dallas Morning News on Saturday by Walter Williams, who I believe is a professor at Georgetown (I wonder if he knows of Dorothy "you're not in Kansas anymore" Denning). The article was titled "Government slowly eroding our liberties", and in it he tells a story attributed to the late Leonard Read who 
sci.crypt	 I must respectfully disagree with this assertion, Brad. The government is notoriously sloppy with physical, communications, and information security. They can't keep their computers safe, and they're "trying". Read "DEA is Not Adequately Protecting National Security Information" [GAO/IMTEC 92-31] for an excellent example of what I'm talking about. 
sci.crypt	 As usually, you are not reading. The proposal -does- say that it is a "voluntary program". This doesn't make it more desirable, though... 
sci.crypt	 It is incompetent, like almost anything you have posted here, so you'll be flamed, sorry. 
sci.crypt	 Nathaniel Sammons (ns111310@LANCE.ColoState.Edu) wrote on Mon, 19 Apr 1993 02:36:36 GMT: If the gov establishes a cryptography standard that has to be used by everyone, and everyone's personal key is divided into two segments and stored at two separate, albeit easy to find places, and that key is only 80 bits to begin with, we are screwed (pardon the allusion to the affore-mentioned article)! 
sci.crypt	 As usual, David Sternlight is demonstrating his inability to read. The proposal clearly states: 
sci.crypt	 A typical example of seep-minded thinking. We all know that David Sternlight is a jerk, but I'm afraid that in this case 90% of the population will think like him. Realize it guys - NSA, Dorothy Denning, and the US government have already won the battle... 
sci.crypt	 Here are some corrections and additions to Hellman's note, courtesy of Dorothy Denning. Again, this is reposted with permission. 
sci.crypt	 I've been asked to supply more specific directions for automated fetching of the source and documentation for "agrep," the powerful similarity pattern matching tool. 
sci.crypt	 Misinterpretation, though it should be a crime in itself, is what United States lawyers use to make their bread and butter. 
sci.crypt	 I recently published a new privacy-protecting off-line electronic cash system as a technical report at CWI. Being a PhD-student at David Chaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research in the field of privacy-protecting cash systems. 
sci.crypt	 I have also been in contact with Mitch about this. I believe him when he says he didn't ask to be on the "clipper" list. 
sci.crypt	 For example, I don't own a cordless phone. With Clipper, I would. If the local men in blue really want to listen to me talk to my friends or order pizza, I'm no worse off than I am now, and I don't have to worry about local kids or nosy neighbors. 
sci.crypt	 Not necessarily --- they could release the details of the algorithm without releasing the "system key" (called SK by Hellman). That would make most people happy, and with some sort of verification procedure before key exchange, the "official" chips would only work with other "official" chips. In other words, secrecy of SK makes "physically identical clone versions" impossible; secrecy of the algorithm shouldn't be necessary. 
sci.crypt	 I am a PhD student. Also I would like some feed-back on the encryption schemes that my research in finite fields can be applied to. Any takers Reply to gamv25@udcf.gla.ac.uk Thanks yours Gavin. 
sci.crypt	 I understand, believe it or not, and there are any number of kinds of conversation and communication I engage in that I wouldn't even consider using this scheme for. On the other hand, I don't see "Clipper" as providing a secure channel--it just prevents casual eavesdropping. This is part of why I am not worried about it per se. Trying to look at Clipper as a serious security tool is simply ludicrous. It's a voice scrambler, nothing more. 
sci.crypt	 I am sure that Mike is correct on this point. I am also pretty sure that administering "truth serum" would be ruled a violation of your right not to incriminate yourself. But, what is the salient difference? Both drawing blood and injecting "truth serum" incapacitate you for a while, but do no permanent damage. Is it simply that we have come to view one as acceptable, while the other is viewed as a fundamental violation of one's rights? If this is the case, how do we expand the protections of the 5th amendment to incorporate new technologies without the results being a hodgepodge of different judges personal opinions? 
sci.crypt	 Just because they can do it anyway, somehow, does not mean it is smart to make the job easier for them. 
sci.crypt	 You're drifting off topic. In any case, if you check on any of the topics devoted to gun rights issues, you will find ample evidence that the "misinformation" is your assertion that the term "the people" in the Second Amendment has mysteriously taken on a meaning diametrically opposite the meaning of the exact same term in the First and Fourth Amendments. 
sci.crypt	 This is an addition (posted with permission) to some tech. details of cliper. They enligthen ??? the use of S1 and S2 for keygeneration. 
sci.crypt	 I think i heard someplace (misc.legal?, comp.org.eff.talk?) that the courts have pretty much eliminated the fourth amendment already. 
sci.crypt	 Are you sure you aren't being watched? Let me remind you that Watergate was only the tip of the iceberg. Nixon extensively used the NSA to watch people because he didn't like them. According to _Decrypting the Puzzle Palace_: 
sci.crypt	 Ah, not in the USA. Thats a relief, thought 'reality' must be slipping for a second. :-) 
sci.crypt	 You can find the salient difference in any number of 5th amendment related Supreme Court opinions. The Court limits 5th amendment protections to what they call "testimonial" evidence, as opposed to physical evidence. 
sci.crypt	 Let me see if I have this straight --- if a person knows S1 and S2, and the serial number of the unit, it's easy to reconstruct UK. Of course, if they know SK, the "family key", they can easily get the serial number of any unit that has made a transmission. So with S1 and S2 being used for a while "batch" of the unit keys, the number of used S1/S2 pairs will probably be fairly low. Of course, you have to believe that the NSA/FBI/name-your-favorite-government agency will know SK so all it needs is the S1/S2 pairs, and presto, nasty details like court orders for wire taps are no longer necessary. 
sci.crypt	 If we do not trust the NSA to be a registrar of Clipper Chip key halves, I would not trust Mitre either. Mitre does lots of work for NSA, at least in the Trusted Product Evaluation Program (evaluation of commercial off the shelf software for its efficacy in safeguarding classified information), and I assume in other, less open, programs. 
sci.crypt	 There has been extensive discussion in the eff forum, for example, about inadmissible taps being used to develop information that could then lead to admissible evidence. This might put a stop to such things, which must from time to time be simple fishing expeditions. 
sci.crypt	 I wholeheartedly agree. Knowing that WE have let our law enforcement agencies seize our property against the Fifth Amendment of OUR Constitution tells me that we are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for SELF-GOVERNANCE. WE have to take our government back from the self-serving politicians who create laws and rules only to better their positions within the government. WE have allowed them to take too much power from the people of this nation. That situation has to be changed. 
sci.crypt	 Thanks for posting this and making it available. This post will be LONG, I will comment on most of it, and am reluctantly leaving all of the original in place to provide context. 
sci.crypt	 The system, or 'family', key would appear to be cryptographically useless, since *every* chip must know it and be able to remove its effects from the bitstream. I daresay that it will be widely known almost immediately after this system is deployed, and since it's been pointed out that there is not a separate decrypt key -- the same key is used for both encryption and decryption -- there goes any benefit to the use of a system-wide key in SkipJack. 
sci.crypt	 For example, I don't own a cordless phone. With Clipper, I would. If the local men in blue really want to listen to me talk to my friends or order pizza, I'm no worse off than I am now, and I don't have to worry about local kids or nosy neighbors. I do tend to agree. Sigh. 
sci.crypt	 arms shall not be infringed, so a well regulated militia may be more easily formed. I have an interpretation of the Second that shows there are no qualifications to the right to keep and bear arms. If you want, I can E-mail it to you. By the way, gun talk belongs in talk.politics.guns. Doug Holland 
sci.crypt	 It always amazes me how quick people are to blame whatever administration is current for things they couldn't possibly have initiated. This chip had to take *years* to develop, yet already we're claiming that the Clinton administration sneaked it in on us. Bullshit. The *Bush* administration and the career Gestapo were responsible for this horror, and the careerists presented it to the new presidency as a fait accompli. That doesn't excuse Clinton and Gore from criticism for being so stupid as to go for it, but let's lay the body at the proper door to start with. 
sci.crypt	 Since the wiretap chip is being distributed internationally, allowing the U.S. government to spy on foreign governments, companies and people as as well as to wiretap domestic citizens, this is a world-wide issue. Please put DISTRIBUTION: WORLD on the Distrubution: line. Thank you. 
sci.crypt	 The final stages of denial... I can hardly imagine what the result would have been if the Clinton administration had actually supported this plan, instead of merely acquiescing with repugnance as they've so obviously doing. I don't believe the chip originated with the Clinton administration either, but the Clinton administration has embraced it and brought it to fruition. 
sci.crypt	 No kidding. The most recent post I saw in alt.privacy.clipper (and I hope anyone interested in this topic ends up there) states that Clipper has been in development for over four years. 
sci.crypt	 I have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentioned examples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on (it has been a couple of years since my Con Law class in college so I hope I am not missing something obvious here...) 
sci.crypt	 Gee, I guess they should also have such a repository for house keys, car keys, safety deposit keys, ... :-( 
sci.crypt	 At first I was going to complain that your analogy was completely irrelevant. But then I remembered something. 
sci.crypt	 reported the Big Brother (Clipper) chip will encrypt plaintext in 64 bit blocks as is done with DES. The users key K which can be derived from RSA, Diffy-Hellman, etc. is used to encrypt plaintext M and is then used to form a "three part message". This three part message consists of E[M; K], K encrypted with some other key, and the chip serial number. This three part message is then encrypted by still another key. My question is: What is a message? For example, say we are dealing with an encrypted digitized voice application. The speech waveform is sampled and digitized and then some number of samples are grouped into a 64 bit block. This block is then encrypted and transmitted over a non-secure communications link. Where is the three part message? Is something appended to each 64 bit block? Is a header sent at the beginning of the session? If the header is sent at the beginning of the session, how do they insure the equipment manufacturer using the chip does just that? Can just anyone manufacture products using the chip? Is a facility clearance required to manufacture? Any ideas? 
sci.crypt	 I am sure you didn't miss the implication that we could have another Richard Nixon type president in the future (perhaps not too distant future, acutally). With that in mind, then I take it you also would not object to the Gov coming up with a decision (not proposal - just like Clinton Cripple is a decision, not a proposal) sprung on us to start placing video cameras with sound in every room of your house, which could be activated without your knowlege. They would be well concealed so you wouldn't know the location, to prevent you from covering the lens opening. After all, nothing you're doing would be of the slightest interest to a government official, right? So, you surely should not object to such a proposal... 
sci.crypt	 I wouldn't trust Mitre for another reason: remember "The Cuckoo's Egg"? How great was their security, eh? 
sci.crypt	 The point you all seem to have missed was covered when the UK cellphone scrambling system was discussed. Incidentally, my MP has responded to my questions on that issue, and it appears that the UK and other `approved' countries will get the secure A5 encryption, and `dodgy' countries will get A5X. Existing mobile equipment will drop to clear mode when used with A5X systems, but newer equipment will use A5/A5X/clear depending on the capabilities of the base station. 
sci.crypt	 I suspect that this clipper thing could backfire on the Gov in a big hurry. I expect that products using these chips will socket them rather than soldering them, since once the keys are handed over by the escrow agencies, the chip is so much garbage, and will need to be replaced. I expect that someone will come along with a pin compatible chip that uses secure encryption -- possibly even disguised so that it's not possible to tell it from the clipper chip until you try to use the 2 backdoor keys. 
sci.crypt	 Just a question. As a provider of a public BBS service - aren't you bound by law to gurantee intelligble access to the data of the users on the BBS, if police comes with sufficent authorisation ? I guessed this would be a basic condition for such systems. (I did run a bbs some time ago, but that was in Switzerland) 
sci.crypt	 Another objection occurred to me. There was a comment about how supposedly there would only be one decode box, operated by the FBI. This is flat ridiculous, and I don't believe it for a millisecond. Even *if* they in fact only build one (or two or some other small number) of these, that won't stop others from building one. Make it work like two Clipper-chip phones, one listening to each side of the recorded conversation. I'll have to have another look at the specs posted so far, but offhand I didn't see anything that would preclude this sort of thing..... 
sci.crypt	 How about this: The TelCo has your Clipper key. The TelCo has your intended partner's key, if he is using one. Whenever you call, the message gets decrypted and reencrypted wihtout y key exchange. I know it's a stupid system, but for the feds, it'd be" 'great. The point of this isn;t to take over the crypto market, BTW. Clinton doen not want people to have any sort of crypto at all (just like Busch). But he needs some support for the "technology initiative" garbage he's pushing (industrial policy stuff) and a computer hip designed by the gov't is just the thing. 
sci.crypt	 And in other parts of the world, European "Socialists" would be known as fascist capitalist pigs. Get your head out of your labels and think carefully for once: 
sci.crypt	 I feel like Winston Churchill in 1941 :( ...... but, the privacy Clipper will, TO THE EXTENT KEY ESCROW IS LEGITIMATE, stop most of the abuse of wiretaps by local cops, company cops, angry husbands/ wives, etc... It is going to be hard for the keystone cops, the Proctor&Gamble cops, etc. to bypass even a product as flawed as the ClipJob. 
sci.crypt	 Unless there has been a _major_ change in the law, there's no such beast as a "classified patent." Patents exist to encourage communications and develop the state of the art. 
sci.crypt	 This must have been in the works for some time. The Bush administration must have been working on it for quite a while. --Clinton simply took the credit (or blame, depending on how you look at it). 
sci.crypt	 The following document summarizes the Clipper Chip, how it is used, how programming of the chip is coupled to key generation and the escrow process, and how law enforcement decrypts communications. Since there has been some speculation on this news group about my own involvement in this project, I'd like to add that I was not in any way involved. I found out about it when the FBI briefed me on Thursday evening, April 15. Since then I have spent considerable time talking with the NSA and FBI to learn more about this, and I attended the NIST briefing at the Department of Commerce on April 16. The document below is the result of that effort. 
sci.crypt	 I would think that you could reduce the defense of using non-clipper based encryption technologies to defending freedom of expression (IE, free speech). That you have to right to express whatever you want in whatever form your little heart desires so long as you do not impinge on the rights of others. 
sci.crypt	 Clipper might be a good way to cover the use of another layer of encryption. 
sci.crypt	 Even if what Brad says turns out to be accurate, you can bet that the Administration will have made it "very clear" to the vendors that "it would very much be in their best interests" to institute a "voluntary" policy of refusing to sell anything but Clinton Cripple equipped equipment to anyone other than "Authorized government agencies and Law Enforcement", or individuals and corporations who "have been been determined by the Administration to have a valid need on a case-by-case basis" for an effective system. 
sci.crypt	 Ok, so there are in fact two distinct components transmitted by the chip; the real message encrypted with the "conventional" key, and the serial number and encrypted "conventional" key encrypted with the (IMHO kind of bogus, as the whole concept of "one key that millions of people use which can't be changed" doesn't seem reasonable) "family key". 
sci.crypt	 Even if they somehow address this issue it is unlikely to be the only back door in -- they might even have a few intentionally visible to distract from the ones that aren't visible. 
sci.crypt	 The Supreme Court seems to disagree with you -- they have stated that "the people" is a term of art refering to an individual right, and have explicitly mentioned the second amendment as an example. 
sci.crypt	 Could you expand on this? I have a feeling you're right, but I don't quite understand. 
sci.crypt	 And the initiative for actual implementation. Clinton is not just an innocent bystander here - They didn't just slap his name on it without consulting him. What exactly is his extensive history of individual rights advocacy that people are assuming he really has nothing to do with this? He just went back on his pledge to cut the espionage budget, and is now asking for more money than even Bush wanted. 
sci.crypt	 Ironically, the domino theory in fact *was* a reasonable metaphor for the collapse of communism, from the liberalizations in Poland and Hungary to the border crossings in the summer of '89 to the fall of the Wall later that year....and then to the ultimate collapse of the USSR. 
sci.crypt	 Other alternatives include output of vmstat, iostat, pstat and friends with various flags, or even better crash. 
sci.crypt	 Doesn't this just mean that the government might not approve something for use by other government agencies. This does not sound to me to be any form of threat that Joe User can't develop and use his own encryption algorithm. 
sci.crypt	 If the Clipper chip can do cheap crypto for the masses, obviously one could do the same thing WITHOUT building in back doors. 
sci.crypt	 True, but will traditional encryptions schemes, when further encrypted by Clipper, be _more_ vulnerable to attacks such as partially known plaintext? 
sci.crypt	 No! Distribution keywords are case sensitive. What you want is 
sci.crypt	 Sounds to me like a *great* gimmick for a replacement market...every so often issue a "Clipper Alert" announcing that some key backup tapes are missing, that some Drug Lords got 'em, whatever. Then the owners of these $1200 Clipperphones have to trot down to their local Key Escrow Agency and buy new chips and have them programmed. 
sci.crypt	 Sure you can buy a TEMPEST approved Mac -- if you have enough money. I haven't had any reason to look at this type of pricing for about 10 years, but a TEMPEST rating in 1982 would raise the price of a $2,495.00 Radio Shack Model III to something around $15,000.00. 
sci.crypt	 The chip and algorithm are classified. If you reverse engineer it and tell people, you are likely to go to jail. 
sci.crypt	 to the phone network. (Anything that plugs in to our BT phone sockets must be approved - for some reason crypto devices just never are...) 
sci.crypt	 That was true for the UK Paul, but I'm fairly sure they're talking about building end-to-end encryption phones out of this chip. It's *not* for cellular (though it certainly could be used there in the way you suggest) 
sci.crypt	 Since the AT&T wiretap chip is scheduled to be distributed internationally, allowing the U.S. government to spy on foreign governments, companies and people as as well as to wiretap domestic citizens, this is a world-wide issue. Thus Distribution: world.

sci.crypt	 Just a question. As a provider of a public BBS service - aren't you bound by law to gurantee intelligble access to the data of the users on the BBS, if police comes with sufficent authorisation ? I guessed this would be a basic condition for such systems. (I did run a bbs some time ago, but that was in Switzerland) 
sci.crypt	 Oh, but can Big Brother afford such things in these times of tight budgets? 
sci.crypt	 With all the activity in sci.crypt these past few days, I am not supprised you missed it... NIST got Skipjack from the NSA :) 
sci.crypt	 And this means that the FBI will want to track the customer lists of better encryption phones, because "the only reason a person would want one is to evade the police." 
sci.crypt	 Just a question. As a provider of a public BBS service - aren't you bound by law to gurantee intelligble access to the data of the users on the BBS, if police comes with sufficent authorisation ? I guessed this would be a basic condition for such systems. (I did run a bbs some time ago, but that was in Switzerland) 
sci.crypt	 Perhaps the trusted escrow agencies can be the ones who come up with S1 and S2, and if these agencies are really trusted (ACLU & NRA is an interesting example), we can hope that they'll use some physical process to come up with truly random numbers. If the NSA comes up with the numbers, that's a trap door you could drive a truck through. 
sci.crypt	 So in a few years there could be millions of these chips in the USA, all networked together? Sounds like a good science fiction story - the government wants to crack foreign DES (or whatever) messages, so they con the public into individually buying all of the components and installing them. Soon the US could be covered by the largest parallel computer in the world, built on top of our current phone net. 
sci.crypt	 nobody seems to have noticed that the clipper chip *must* have been under development for considerably longer than the 3 months that clinton has been president. this is not something that choosing choosing bush over clinton would have changed in the slightest; it has been in the works for some time. 
sci.crypt	 Wouldn't a a second monitor of similar type scrolling gibberish and adjacent to the one being used provide reasonable resistance to tempest attacks? 
sci.crypt	 I seriously doubt that any practical implementation of this proposal would place the onus on the individual to register keys. Realistically, the Clipper-Chip will probably emit an ID code which will serve as the identifier when requesting the key fragments. The chip manufacturer would register this identifier code vs. key combination when the chip is made and the (uninitiated) end-user can therefore remain completely outside the loop. The chip could be used in a cellular phone, a modem, or other device -- it really makes no difference: When the authorities detect the use of this encryption standard during surveillance, they would then capture the ID and apply for the key in order to decrypt the data. 
sci.crypt	 Please note that Bill Clinton probably has little if anything to do with the design, implementation or reasoning behind this chip or behind any "moves" being made using this chip as a pawn. 
sci.crypt	 What are the typical sizes for keys for commercial secret key algorithms? I know DES is 56 bits ("tripple DES" is 112 bits) and IDEA is 128 bits. Is there anything made in the US that has 128 bit keys? Anything anywhere that has larger keys? I've heard that RC2 can be scaled to arbitrarily large keys, but is this actually implemented anywhere? 
sci.crypt	 If Clipper comes to cellular phones along with legal proscriptions against using other cipher systems on these phones, a new and potentially dangerous class of crime is created. 
sci.crypt	 Actually, old video games and pinball machines are supposed to work pretty good (at blocking EM eavesdropping), too. Those things put out a LOT of EM noise. Back in the 80's, I read about computer companies putting bunches of games in their buildings for just this purpose (not to mention the $$$). 
sci.crypt	 They key depositories are IRRELEVANT. In order for the applicable law enformcement agencies to be able to know what keys to request from escrow, the system will have to squawk its serial number in clear text as part of the link establishment protocol. Whoever owns the program that assigns keys to each serial number won't need access to the key depository. 
sci.crypt	 It does give privacy, just not absolute privacy. The announcement was very up front about this, and about allowing wiretaps. How is this "fooling" anyone? 
sci.crypt	 Actually, many of us have noted this. We have noted that the program started at least 4 years ago, that the contracts with VLSI Technology and Microtoxin were let at least 14 months ago, that production of the chips is well underway, and so forth. 
sci.crypt	 Notwithstanding all the legitimate fuss about this proposal, how much of a change is it? ATT's last product in this area (a) was priced over $1000, as I suspect 'clipper' phones will be; (b) came to the customer with the key automatically preregistered with government authorities. Thus, aside from attempting to further legitimize and solidify the fed's posture, Clipper seems to be "more of the same", rather than a new direction. Yes, technology will eventually drive the cost down and thereby promote more widespread use- but at present, the man on the street is not going to purchase a $1000 crypto telephone, especially when the guy on the other end probably doesn't have one anyway. Am I missing something? The real question is what the gov will do in a year or two when air- tight voice privacy on a phone line is as close as your nearest pc. That has got to a problematic scenario for them, even if the extent of usage never surpasses the 'underground' stature of PGP. 
sci.crypt	 Note that TEMPEST is the name of the shielding standard. TEMPEST is not the name of the surveillance technique. 
sci.crypt	 But, if you are making custom equipment in any case, why not just roll your own Clipper implementation and report the wrong keys to the Escrow agency? (Tells us who is going to be in the chip business if this thing goes through--NSA, and those with something to hide from NSA.) 
sci.crypt	 I can see high-voltage type display devices being vulnerable (CRTs, plasma displays, etc.) But Jason beat me to this question. What about EM radiation from low-voltage items like LCD displays? 
sci.crypt	 Thousands? Tens of thousands? Do some arithmetic, please... Skipjack has 2^80 possible keys. Let's assume a brute-force engine like that hypothesized for DES: 1 microsecond per trial, 1 million chips. That's 10^12 trials per second, or about 38,000 years for 2^80 trials. Well, maybe they can get chips running at one trial per nanosecond, and build a machine with 10 million chips. Sure -- only 3.8 years for each solution. 
sci.crypt	 Why doing it in such a rough manner? It is much more professional to steal the chip from the phone and even to replace it with a pin-compatible do-nothing chip that does not encrypt at all. Chances are that the victim will not notice anything, especially if it is done professionally. 
sci.crypt	 It depends on the algorithm used. 128-bit secret keys for RSA are definitively not secure enough. 
sci.crypt	 Well, I'm not a lawyer, but from what I can tell this is completely and utterly untrue. 
sci.crypt	 Actually, I am *completely* baffled by why Dorothy Denning has chosen to throw away her academic respectability like this. It looks to me like a *major* Career Limiting Move. There can be very few people who know what she's been saying who take her seriously any more. 
sci.crypt	 Even more interesting: the SMTP server at csrc.ncsl.nist.gov no longer recognizes the 'expn' and 'vrfy' commands... 
sci.crypt	 I've got no doubts that this would probably have gone ahead if Bush was still president. What's puzzling to me are the people who are apparently amazed that Clinton is going along with it. 
sci.crypt	 One of the candidates that has been suggested for a key registration body is the ACLU. I think this is poor choice. The ACLU is essentially a group of auditors: they audit how people's civil liberties are administered. Traditionally, auditors do not like to get involved in the design or operational aspects of things, and with good reason. 
sci.crypt	 I think I should also point out that the mystical DES engines are known plaintext engines (unless you add a ton of really smart hardware?) 
sci.crypt	 I'm attempting to write a serious policy paper examining whether the proposed wiretap (or "Clipper") chip is a cost-effective tool for police investigation. That is, ignoring concerns about government intrusions into individual privacy, is the value of easy wiretaps to investigators greater than the cost to the communications industry, and their customers, to support this wiretap technology? 
sci.crypt	 in this regard that permission to export PKZIP's encryption scheme has twice been denied by NSA. Draw you own conclusions. 
sci.crypt	 I am an idiot. The plaintext that's relevant is the session key. If you know that, you probably don't need a roomful of chips, do you? If you were going to brute force something interesting, that'd be the message stream, which is sort of approximately known by, say, a bug in my office. Then your roomful of chips could get the session key. Which I change every morning. 
sci.crypt	 Yow - get some sleep Brad! You mean that people (i.e. life-is-cheap terrorists & drug-dealing warlords) who want to communicate in privacy will prefer to break into my house, kill or kidnap me, and steal my telephone, rather than: 
sci.crypt	 I've been a very intent NREN spectator of the NREN for years. As a commercial IP software vendor, it really is my professional opinion that the NREN, at this point, is irrelevant to private sector networking. If it had been deployed five years ago, it would have been a major development. Now, however, it's just an upgrade to the NSFnet, and an attempt to revive the lagging use of the national supercomputer centers. You could cut out the NSFnet completely, and the Internet would continue chugging along without a hiccup (aside from a few universities). 
sci.crypt	 The only way to view this method of generating unit keys is as a back-door. What else can you call a key deterministically generated from the serial number? 
sci.crypt	 I find this a very disturbing view! Yes, we DO care about EVERYONE's privacy... Even if "they" don't know it. What happens if the gov't starts creating legislation such that the Clipper and such technologies become the only "legal" encryption forms? What happens when the Clipper is the *ONLY* type of encryption chips available to the masses? 
sci.crypt	 Quoting pla@sktb.demon.co.uk in article <8AOHOnj024n@sktb.demon.co.uk: You have every reason to be scared shitless. Take a look at the records of McCarthy, Hoover (J. Edgar, not the cleaner - though they both excelled at sucking) and Nixon. 
sci.crypt	 Actually, I've been following her remarks for some time, with interest. I'm also a member of academia, and her remarks have nothing but elevate her respectability in my eyes. It remains to be seen whether you are the radical fringe, or I. 
sci.crypt	 Hmmm, this could become a flame war very quickly. The text is "...well regulated militia..." When that amendment was written and approved, "regulated" meand "armed". Remember all of those Westerns where bounty hunters were called "regulators"? This is now an archaic usage of the word, but the original intent of the amendment was about weapons, not control. 
sci.crypt	 We don't yet know if all 80 bits count. Anyway, its looking like the keys and escrow arrangements are smoke and mirrors to cover the way the NSA can regenerate the key from the transmitted serial number. 
sci.crypt	 While I think it is unrealistic to suppose that the federal agencies will fail to promptly comply with a court order, there is still a good point here. Local law enforcement will be unable to perform a wiretap without bringing in federal agencies. Based on the (possibly incomplete) understanding of the system quoted from D. Denning, only the FBI will be able to decrypt the system key encryption layer, which seems to be needed even to identify what escrowed keys to request. This moves a great deal of law enforcement power to the federal level. The reason I like this point is that it may sway or even persuade people who don't generally line up with the civil liberties crowd. A national police force is opposed by people from a broad range of political viewpoints. 
sci.crypt	 For that matter, it shouldn't be that difficult to design a black box that gives off EMR similar to a monitor with gibberish on the screen.... 
sci.crypt	 I'm not sure it is a major limiting move... in the academic circles I've seen, arguing for increased government intervention and management is almost always a plus (not the least because it usually means more high paying jobs for academics as "advisors"). Also consider that it looks like Denning has some decent NSA / government connections, which is always a plus for an academic institute that wants more government funding and work tossed their way. 
sci.crypt	 Assuming that the bad guys can easily obtain substitute chips which don't cause any noticeable effect to either the user or the person at the other end of the line (if there is any significant difficulty to obtaining such chips, some of the criminals will decide to fall back on the murder/kidnap method). 
sci.crypt	 Which is to say: is the NSA -totally- perfidious, or does it at least have the redeeming virtue of taking care of its own? <g 
sci.crypt	 First, what the fuck is NASA doing wasting my tax dollars doing policy papers on stuff far outside of their purvew/mission? 
sci.crypt	 Here are four pseudo-random character generators, based on irreducible trinomials. Each contains 16 separate trinomials, one of which is selected on initialization (there are 64 distinct trinomials between the 4 PRCGs). The PRCGs are initialized with a 32-bit seed, and a 4-bit trinomial- selector. 
sci.crypt	 It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained. I can even imagine this being found legal and constitutional, since nothing is actually listened to until a valid warrant is issued and the keys are obtained. 
sci.crypt	 It depends on the attack. Adding a bit to the key doubles the amount of work to be done in a straight brute-force attack, where you try every single possible key until one works. Processing and storage requirements for this kind of attack on a 128-bit key seem like they ought to make it effectively impossible. However, there may be other attacks whose difficulty is (for example) proportional to, say, 2**sqrt(n), or some such. Also, a long key does you little good if there is a way to incrementally guess a little of the key at a time.... 
sci.crypt	 note Clinton's statements about encryption in the 3rd paragraph.. I guess this statement doesen't contradict what you said, though. 
sci.crypt	 This only makes sense if the government prohibits alternative non-escrowed encryption schemes. Otherwise, why not just use the front end without clipper? 
sci.crypt	 I'd lost the White House's deathless prose when I posted (that's what happens when you read news at home when you're rat-arsed), but I did have a bunch of follow-ups going on about cellular/cordless comms. The original article has reappeared, so: 
sci.crypt	 previous poster to yourself, as well. The first clause is not a condition, it is a reason for explicitly supporting the right WHICH EXISTS, MILITIA OR NOT, that the people have a right to keep and bear arms. This is NOT a right granted by the Constitution, it is a right presumed to exist by default. The Constitution mentioning a right is to prevent the government from removing that right by stating very clearly the government shall NOT infringe (mess with, block, limit) that right. Remember the Constitution is a bunch of negative things - things the government CANNOT do. All rights, etc not epxressly given to the government go to the states and the PEOPLE (the same people the other 9 Amendments in the Bill of Rights talk about). 
sci.crypt	 I think your experiences under the Bulgarian regime are highly relevant. We have too many people with their heads in the sand saying it cannot happen here, as our Constitutional Rights are being trashed every day because the government justifies doing some end-run around the protections by a 'crisis' requiring 'drastic action'. It is most likely that in the future possession of secure encryption tools will be regarded as possession of 'terrorist and drug dealers tools', and be some serious Fedaral Felony. Just like common tools are 'burgular tools' if the police say so, common computer programs (even computers themselves) are now 'hackers tools', and will become 'terrorist tools'. BET ON IT. 
sci.crypt	 One minor nitpick: It is not a proposal. It is a *DECISION* ... from their point of view it is a DONE DEAL. The chips are being manufactured, it obviously has been budgeted, the whole thing. THAT IS WHAT IS SO UPSETTING. THIS WAS ALL DONE IN SECRET. Because they DIDN'T want the people to know what was going on until it is too late. 
sci.crypt	 Some countries have laws about importing crypto gear--I believe the U.S. does. Without a license the above scheme won't work (at least not legally) in such countries, including at least France and the U.S. 
sci.crypt	 This won't work if there is a checksum on the keys you don't know about. Neither will registering a clipper chip and then substituting a "counterfeit" one if the serial number contains a checksum. 
sci.crypt	 Actually the govrnment is telling you that if you want to use their "product" the manufacturer (actually better yet, some "trusted" pair of escrow agencies) has to have the key. 
sci.crypt	 OK, Doug is right, it would be obstruction of justice, blah blah blah, BUT, saying "I forgot" is a lie, which is just as bad from a moral point of view _IF_ you think "lawfulness" is a good in and of itself (which admittedly most people do not.) But there's an even better way out of this. PROVIDED the government is prosecuting you criminally, you can probably plead the fifth amendmeent and thus LEGALLY avoid revealing your key. The government cannot demand information from a criminal defendant which "may tend to incriminate" that defendant. Though this has never been applied in the cryptography context (at least as far as I can tell) it seems an obvious application to me. 
sci.crypt	 The people on usenet are clearly a special bunch. We live the net, which is the future of our culture. Usenetters have rapid electronic access to information. Society in general must depend on CNN. 
sci.crypt	 OK, I should have read the thread before posting my own $0.02. I would just add to Phil's very infomative discussion the following caveat: the fifth amendment applies ONLY in crinial cases. ("...nor shall any person . . . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself..."). Thus if the father sued for custody of the children, the case would be civil and the defendant mother would not have fifth amendment protection. Oddly enough, her refusal to give information in a civil case can lead to criminal contempt charges (thus landing her in jail.) The interesting part of all this is that in a murder trial, the woman CAN plead the fifth as to the location of the child--this is routine. A "computer crime" prosecution thus would seem to be fertile ground for this kind of defense, where a suit by a party injured by "hackers" would not. If I am accused, for example, of sending encrypted kiddie porn over the nets the fifth should protect my key. If I am accused of sending copyrighted material, however, it proabably will not (copyright infringement not being a "crime" in the technical sense.) The REALLY tricky question is, say I do both (naughty boy that I am) can the government use the information gained in the civil trial (ie. my key) to gain access to my files for use in the criminal prosecution. The answer should certainly be no, but lord only knows how this would work out. 
sci.crypt	 as someone who just lived through a switch from SunOS4.x.x. to Solaris, i'll heartily agree with this. 
sci.crypt	 Can we use murder instead of copyright violation, just to keep things straight? The 5th applies only to criminal cases which copyright infringements are not (they are civil). 
sci.crypt	 So what? Justices William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, John Paul Stevens, and Byron White are associated with a plurality Supreme Court decision that prevented the removal of "anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, and just plain filthy" books from a public high school library [_Board of Education v. Pico_ (1982)]. Does this mean that they could no longer defend free expression and privacy? 
sci.crypt	 Whew! Take it easy on the guy. Maybe he's going to do this in his spare time. Maybe he's going to do this to see how much a wiretap *really* costs. Maybe he's going to do this so he can add to the opposition to Clipper. I don't know fully why he might do this, but maybe we shouldn't start flaming at the drop of a hat. 
sci.crypt	 Funny, we had plenty of them in Bulgaria, regardless of the embargo... :-) So much for export controls... 
sci.crypt	 What is the status of cruptology for private citizens throughout the world? or, more clearly, is there a listing of countries and their policies on citizens encrypting electronic data? 
sci.crypt	 It means that the EFF's public stance is complicated with issues irrelevant to the encryption issue per se. There may well be people who care about the encryption issue who don't care to associate themselves with the network erotica issue (or may even disagree with the EFF's position). 
sci.crypt	 I am a new reader of sci.crypt I would like to obtain a copy of a public domain program that can encrypt files, preferably using DES, that runs under MS-DOS. 
sci.crypt	 I thought I would note that except Lenstra's packages, none of the large-integer packages are in the public domain. As an alternative, a straightforward *PD* implementation of Knuth's algorithms may be found as a part of Uof Arizona's ICON distribution. 
sci.crypt	 Normally I'd be the last to argue with Steve . . . but shouldn't that read "3.8 years for *all* solutions". I mean, if we can imagine the machine that does 1 trial/nanosecond, we can imagine the storage medium that could index and archive it. 
sci.crypt	 I perhaps should have been clearer and more concise in my post, but that's what I get from posting at 1 am... 
sci.crypt	 This only makes sense if the government prohibits alternative non-escrowed encryption schemes. Otherwise, why not just use the front end without clipper? 
sci.crypt	 Once the chips are released (in phones, or whatever), they are vulnerable to phsyical inspection and observation. Now, I will grant that there will no doubt be safeguards against "peeling" the chip, but the NSA has no monopoly on cleverness. The chip, and the algorithms it uses, will not remain secret for very long. Any university with a VLSI lab has the required equipment, as does any offshore semiconductor manufacturer. 
sci.crypt	 No, he gives the keys to the FBI (who may then give them to the local police on request) who then simply put some alagator clips on your phone junction box and conduct an illegal tap. They then decrypt when they recover the tape. Its just doing what the government does best: breaking the law. 
sci.crypt	 grady@netcom.com suggests using a common but restricted-distribution private key to allow public key system encrypted postings. In theory that will work fine as long as the privae key remains secure. 
sci.crypt	 Absolutely, if I were assured by someone I trusted that the black box was more secure. I have nothing to conceal from the government, but I would like to be sure that any Russian, Japanese, French, or other competitors for my services can't read my traffic. I'd like to be sure that competitive bid information was safe from commercial competitors and foreign governments which would aid them. 
sci.crypt	 Hmmmm. I think, with really large keyspaces like this, you need to alter the strategy discussed for DES. Attempt decryption of several blocks, and check the disctribution of the contents. I don't think it's at all feasible to keep 2**80 encryptions of a known plaintext block on *any* amount of tape or CD-ROM. And certainly not 2**128 such encrypted blocks. (Anyone know a cheap way of converting every atom in the solar system into a one bit storage device?) 
sci.crypt	 er, excuse me but since the escrow agencies aren't yet chosen, how can you say they have a "history of untrustworthy behavoir[sic]"? 
sci.crypt	 I don't claim to be a crypto analyist... there isn't a whole lot of good literature on the subject, and the best people don't seem to publish their work :) but I rather doubt the approach such folks use is brute force (sorry to have implied that in my previous post). The history of these things is folks find clever ways of limiting the search and bang from there. 
sci.crypt	 I may be an anarchist nutcase, but I wouldn't have frothed overmuch had the government proposed a secure encryption standard. In fact, if the NSA had come up with a privacy chip rather than a wiretap chip, I would have been happy. They *could* have done this -- set up an ANSI committee, picked a secure cryptosystem, defined a protocol and interface, and said, "Hey, start building them." 
sci.crypt	 I apologize for being so dense but this sentence reads as if it was lifted from a Luis Bunuel screenplay. Am I missing something? Why on earth would drug smugglers even _use_ the device then? Obviously, they'll be using something like triple encryption DES instead. As long as alternatives to Clipper remain legal, Clipper accomplishes absolutely nothing, ZERO, as far as law enforcement is concerned. The whole scheme is an absolute, total, incredible, waste of government time and money AS LONG AS other encryption schemes that are any good remain legal. In order for Clipper to work as intended all strong cryptosystems have to be outlawed. 
sci.crypt	 Aside from possession of "terrorist tools" (unapproved encryption devices or programs)... 
sci.crypt	 There is a very comprehensive list in sci.math.symbolic, which detailed descriptions of many packages. (Especially you, Mark, should update your list :-) ) Here it is: 
sci.crypt	 I think I should also point out that the mystical DES engines are known plaintext engines (unless you add a ton of really smart hardware?) 
sci.crypt	 Even more interesting: the SMTP server at csrc.ncsl.nist.gov no longer recognizes the 'expn' and 'vrfy' commands... 
sci.crypt	 Actually, many of us have noted this. We have noted that the program started at least 4 years ago, that the contracts with VLSI Technology and Microtoxin were let at least 14 months ago, that production of the chips is well underway, and so forth. 
sci.crypt	 It seems pretty obvious that it will be made illegal if VERY LOUD NOISE is not made about this IMMEDIATELY to Congress and the House! 
sci.crypt	 I refer to the Federal law enforcement apparatus (which is ultimately in charge of this) generally. 
sci.crypt	 Yes, "Clipper" is a trademark of Intergraph. Its the RISC chip used in some of thier workstations. 
sci.crypt	 This is true for the mass market, but not for those who need strong crypto and are willing to pay the price. After all, one can buy strong crypto today if one is willing to spend enough. 
sci.crypt	 Agreed. Remember, I don't even think of Clipper as encryption in any real sense--if I did, I'd probably be a lot more annoyed about it. 
sci.crypt	 But there is a MUCH more pernicious problem with the scheme as proposed. Building a brute force machine to test 2^40 possible keys if you have the other half from one escrow agent is EASY. (One chip, one test per microsecond gives you one break every two weeks, and that break gives you all messages involving that phone.) 
sci.crypt	 but there are certainly exceptions. If you write a paper which includes sufficiently detailed information on how to build a nuclear weapon, it is classified. As I understand the law, nuclear weapons design is _automatically_ classified even if you do the work yourself. I believe you are then not allowed to read your own paper. 
sci.crypt	 Have you heard of PGP? I assume from your post that you have not. PGP 2.2 is a freeware RSA encryption program which includes digital signatures and comprehensive key management facilities. Most sites also keep the source code. A growing number of people are using this excellent software to encrypt (to a very high standard) their email and data. Get it before Clinton outlaws it. 
sci.crypt	 Marc is not spoofing. Try it yourself. At least, the commands work exactly as he described (i.e. they do not work.) 
sci.crypt	 I was a cryptologic tech in the US Navy (CTRSN, nothing big). All 'spooks' in the Navy are required to know the "gist" of "USSID 18", the Navy-way of naming a particular Presidential "Executive Order". It outlines what spooks can and can't do with respect to the privacy of US nationals. 
sci.crypt	 Perhaps these encryption-only types would defend the digitized porn if it was posted encrypted? 
sci.crypt	 Unless there has been a _major_ change in the law, there's no such beast as a "classified patent." Patents exist to encourage communications and develop the state of the art. 
sci.crypt	 That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something they can get caught at. And key size is one of the things that can be verified externally. Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the output. We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change. 
sci.crypt	 The willingness of the majority of the people to give up their freedom in exchange for a sense of safety is hardly limited to the USA, and is an endemic problem in any human society of any appreciable size. The structure of the US government does try to combat this tendency to some extent, but fighting entropy is always a losing battle. Most people would rather have comfort than freedom. The paradox is that you can't really have the former, in the long term, unless you have the latter. 
sci.crypt	 Now I wouldn't be the one to claim that you are injecting some disinformation into the net, Andrew, but 'paranoia' refers to unwarranted or excessive suspicions or fear, not those that have reasonable roots. 
sci.crypt	 Imagine if this were available during the 1992 elections; instead of clumsily searching through the Clinton passport file, they could have just done a "voice-grep" (as someone stated earlier) on his telephone conversations for the last 10 years. 
sci.crypt	 The Clipper standard *is* the first step toward outlawing other strong encryption standards. If the government didn't intend to outlaw other forms of encryption, than Clipper is just a big waste of time and money. Why, you ask? Because anyone who is transferring data that any government agency could use against him/her would be a total fool to use the Clipper system..So why add the backdoor-key if all lawbreakers will use alternate encryption methods? Because they assume they can just do away with everything else. I, for one, am planning on boycotting any equipment that contains clipper technology. 
sci.crypt	 As one of the happily sleeping people, I would just like to ask this- aren't people just slightly overreacting to this? Or are we all of a sudden going to draw parallels to Nazi Germany and Communist Russia? 
sci.crypt	 A good vocoder like ours will give you 8000 bits per second locked at full rate (it's a variable rate voice activity vocoder). If you want less quality, cut that to 4000 bps (half rate). At full rate variable you could put two full-duplex conversations on a V.32bis modem. This requires a DSP or ASICs, though. An RS-6000 has a CPU that could probably do it in real-time, because it has the add-and-multiply instruction and a few other DSP things. 
sci.crypt	 How are you sure of that? Weren't there some recent studies that found corelations between not-yet announced decisions and market changes? 
sci.crypt	 Without getting into the *really* *thorny* questions about reverse engineering and all of that, let me just point out that there already exist gate arrays and suchlike that have what's known as a security fuse which can be programmed after you've verified all other programming -- this makes it impossible to read out the programming of the device (again, ignoring the reverse engineering questions). Speaking from experience here: I had to completely reinvent one of my designs some six or seven years ago when the disk file was zapped, the backups were all bad, and the devices were unreadable because of the security fuses. Made me appreciate the value of printouts. ;-) 
sci.crypt	 i don't have FTP and i live in canada ( this means that it would be illeagle for a U.S. citizen to send the program to me. their gigerment wishes to restrict its dispersil ) but someone in europe must have ported a coppy of RSA to the atariST by now. how do i get a coppy of the RSA from a non-FTP news feed? 
sci.crypt	 CHIP STRUCTURE The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption algorithm called "Skipjack." The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES). It supports all 4 DES modes of operation. Throughput is 16 Mbits a second. [...] 
sci.crypt	 What??? This is an incredible statement! The NSA tried to suppress public key crypto and RSA, and yet they claim to encourage use of strong crypto for US citizens. 
sci.crypt	 I think you'd have to do some massive data compression just to fit a bit of key information on each primary particle of the known universe.' "But, hey, it's fun to imagine. 
sci.crypt	 Do you know of any freely distributable c++ (or c) code for public key cryptography (such as RSA)? 
sci.crypt	 And some people thought that I am exaggerating when claiming that the Cripple Chip is just a first step in a totalitarian plot against the civil liberties in the USA... It seems that I've even been an optimist - the things are happening even faster than I expected.... That's another of the dirty tricks they used to apply on us under the communist regime - do something secret, THEN tell the people about is (after the fact, when nothing can be done any more), and of course, explaining them how much better the situation is now... 
sci.crypt	 If there are many as..., er, people in the USA who reason like the above, then it should not be surprising that the current plot has been allowed to happen... 
sci.crypt	 I guess the cryptowranglers read this group too. But of course I knew that because it is so easy to do. There is not a single doubt in my mind that every byte that passes every significant gateway or 'bone is captured for the colligation of data about __________? (Maybe your name is here). 
sci.crypt	 Of course, nothing prevents you from buying a new lock with cash and installing it yourself. Even modifying the core to match some arbitrary key is not difficult to do at home. I once knew someone who had fixed his locks in this way - his house, office and cars all took the same key (which he took GOOD care of :-) 
sci.crypt	 If the device is designed to use the key that's registered with the Feds, I don't see how you -can- feed it a different key. If the user can change the key to any of the 2^80 possibilities, the main reason for regarding this proposal as unacceptable disappears. 
sci.crypt	 I hope there is something I don't understand about this system, but can someone tell me how these chips are going to be manufactured while maintaining each half key under total control of the separate escrow agencies? Don't both halfs of the key have to come together (in some form) at the time the chip is constructed? 
sci.crypt	 Us having the liberties to talk about this doesn't make the problem go away. It doesn't make it right. Rather the opposite, if we do not do anything about it, you can bet it's going to get worse. 
sci.crypt	 Now why would anyone "post" anything encrypted? Encryption is only of use between persons who know how to decrypt the data. 
sci.crypt	 I was responding to another person (Tarl Neustaedter) who held that the EFF wasn't the best organization to fight for crytography rights since the EFF also supports the right to distribute pornography over the internet, something some Crypto people might object to. In other words, he's implying that there are people who will protect any speech, just as long as it is encrypted. 
sci.crypt	 Agreed. This is like the Bay of Pigs fiasco (planned by the Eisenhower Administration but given the final green light by Kennedy). To be sure, hen it all went down, Kennedy was at least man enough to take full responsibility, which is not what I expect from Slick Willie Clinton.... 
sci.crypt	 Yes. Reasonable parallels. (though I don't think Russia ever claimed to be Communist) 
sci.crypt	 I hope there are some silicon jocks on the committee who can follow the algorithm through to hardware. While I doubt the NSA would pull any monkey business on this point -- they have to expect that the chip will be reverse-engineered sooner or later -- it's an obvious opportunity to introduce additional holes. 
sci.crypt	 I think a new organization would be a much better idea, as the NRA carries as much undesireable baggage for me as the EFF and CPSR do for others. 
sci.crypt	 long to start up. I would certainly join.) 
sci.crypt	 That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something they can get caught at. And key size is one of the things that can be verified externally. Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the output. We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change. 
sci.crypt	 As far as I know ISDN (call it Swissnet here, and it's being plugged in) it's 8 bit 8000Hz (gives you one channel of 64kBit/sec) I guess you should not go below a sampling rate of 6000 Hz if you want to have same quality as on an analog-line. Anybody knows compression-algorithms & -factors for voice ? 
sci.crypt	 ONLY IF this chip catches on. Which means alternatives have to be developed. Which will only happen if Clipper is discredited. 
sci.crypt	 That's nothing. They wouldn't let the British buy Inmos Transputer systems because of security concerns. And we designed the damn things! 
sci.crypt	 As promised, I spoke today with the company mentioned in a Washington Times article about the Clipper chip announcement. The name of the company is Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end of this message on how to contact them). 
sci.crypt	 Note: I am *not* a cable freak, so I might have completely misunderstood what you said. Also, my math is frequently noted for being wrong, so you'll better check the calculations yourself. 
sci.crypt	 But what about second sources for pin-compatible non-Clipper algorithm chips that also have escrowed keys? If a "reputable firm" produces a chip (with escrowed key) that is a pop-in replacement for the Clipper chip in my phone, and uses an algorithm that is widely known and evaluated and "trusted," then what's the problem? 
sci.crypt	 Preventing black market chips w/non-escrowed keys IS exactly what they mean by protecting the security of the key escrow system. There are two parts to the security of such a system: 
sci.crypt	 The problem with "Let's assume" reasoning is that, taken to the extreme (and you're close), you arrive at "Let's assume this is perfectly OK." 
sci.crypt	 To me, a larger problem is that once disclosed, your keys could be used to decrypt any previously recorded conversations. I gather that from this proposal a warrant would be required to get the keys, but not to collect conversations! Consider the scenario where an agency collects preemptively all encrypted conversations for certain people likely to be targets (and not necessarily "legitimate" targets), then arranges for some unrelated incident that can trigger a warrant: 
sci.crypt	 I don't find this a credible argument, for two reasons. One you have supplied below: unless I care about entering the USA at any time in the future (eg. the Taiwanese backyard cloners - who BTW have been known to decap custom silicon and reproduce it on daughterboards when pirating high-profit arcade machines and the like - who wouldn't care less), I am not going to care much about US confidentiality, am I? Only people like the real me, who does care about travelling to various countries for business reasons, will sit up and follow laws like this, but I would contend that we're not the main threat. 
sci.crypt	 I must admit that this point has been running through my mind for most of the discussion: one the dice are out there, it won't be long before someone decaps it and, after a bit of work, has full details of the Clipper algorythm. This isn't trivial to do, but then again, it is not impossibly difficult either. Any half way decent VLSI design student should be able to take a photograph of a technology s/he is familiar with, and given a description of the input, output, control and supply lines, figure out the function of various subsystems on the die. Indeed, this is not an uncommon exercise performed during training (because it makes you think about design decisions made by other designers. 
sci.crypt	 I really like these claims. Where did they come from? We hear, practically daily, that the NSA monitors, oh, everything. They can crack anything. They'd never release a cryptosystem they couldn't crack. 
sci.crypt	 Having read the various "Clipper" announcements on the net over the last few days and a LOT of uninformed speculation about the chip, its uses, government plots, etc, I have the following questions. 
sci.crypt	 I'm definitely going to write my Congressman, and nobody's ever going to make me respect a law that violates my freedom of speech, and if the feds try to enforce this law on me, I will protect my freedoms, with force if it ever comes to that. (Hopefully, it won't) 
sci.crypt	 I agree with this assessment. Furthermore, its promotion as providing greater protection than bare voice is quite true, as far as it goes. However, the only way for it to fulfill its stated goal of letting LE wiretap "terrorists and drug dealers" is to restrict stronger techniques. 
sci.crypt	 Just to make sure everyone is clear on this: "it never has" refers to "protects", not "fails to protect"; i.e., in my lifetime I have never seen the U.S. government consistently protect the interest of U.S. citizens, except by accident. 
sci.crypt	 It would be in a different location, so a directional antenna could probably lock in on just the one monitor. Failing that, a phased array could likely seperate the signals. Admittedly, this is expensive, but so is all the rest of this stuff anyway. 
sci.crypt	 At the company I worked for previously, I received a file that was des encryped and the person that had sent it, went on vaction. Rather than wait two weeks I set up a straight frontal attack with one key at a time. It only took two(2) days to crack the file. No, I don't have any faith in DES. 
sci.crypt	 I totally agree. But how do you propose we take government back? They obviously don't listen to the people or want the people to know who is responsibile for what (a person telnetted the site of the Clipper chip release, to see what the entity 'clipper' was, and got a few lists. BUt when another person tried a bit later, the commands were disabled) Does not sound like an Administration that wants to have any accountability or information they don't control given to the people. The secret development and implimentation of the Clipper Chip decision further backs that up. You can bet unaurhorized encryption methods and software will be considered 'terrorist tools' and also subject to civil forfeiture, along with the systems that are running it. YOU WATCH, SEE IF I AM WRONG. 
sci.crypt	 Probably cheaper than you think. I'll bet some of my (and yours) tax dollars become a subsidy for these chips. If these chips don't sell well, what's to stop the US government from 'giving' them away (in the interest of National Security)?

sci.crypt	 Here is a revised version of my summary which corrects some errors and provides some additional information and explanation. 
sci.crypt	 You seem to be assuming that all arrests are of equal value, and that the use of wiretaps is spread uniformly among them. 
sci.crypt	 While I didn't try the expansion personally, I know of at least two other people who did and got the same results. Your allegation is incorrect at best. 
sci.crypt	 For those of you looking for information on MS-DOS 6.0's file system compression API: 
sci.crypt	 Don't get fooled by exponents 2^80 (possible keys) is not in the same league with 10^80 (particles in the universe). 2^80 < 10^25. Remember Avagadro's number? There are about that many elementary particles (not molecules) in one mole. Pretty small universe! Or if you can put 5 Gigabytes on one tape, you would need about 10 trillion tapes (allowing several bytes per entry). Still more than all of the existing magnetic media on the planet, but wait a few years. (I'm including existing audio and video cassettes in the total. Ten trillion is about 2,000 per person worldwide... Gives new meaning to the suspicions of hiden messages.) 
sci.crypt	 Excellent point, and there's a related point I'd like to make. They'll have to back up these databases themselves, won't they? How many tape copies will there be, and how secure will the tapes be? If they store them off-site, it wouldn't be too hard to hijack them in transit. If they're all kept on-site, one good bomb attack by some group intent on freeing us from the threat of government snooping will take care of the problem once and for all. I can see it now -- "Hi, we're from the government and we, um, misplaced our copy of your key. Could you mail us a copy?" 
sci.crypt	 Could somebody provide an overview of the proposed systems using the chip? (Ought to see if ATT has a spec sheet) Skipjack sounds like a normal digital encryption algorithm, so the data path will have to be voice -- digitize -- compress -- encrypt Compression will be necessary to fit the data on the wire, unless they want to wait for ISDN (that we should be so lucky...). Feeding pre-encrypted data into the compressor will cause it to chuckle at you; you'd have to tap into the guts of the phone and hack either the compressed data stream, or selected parts of the output stream before it hits the modem. Unless you want to pay for two fast modems on top of the encryption, and just plug the box in between your phone and the wall. 
sci.crypt	 After reading the debate over the Clipper, I have a few things to add. 
sci.crypt	 She hasn't. Dorothy Denning has spent many years earning the professional respect of her colleagues, and something won in this manner is not easily lost. Her support of the clipper -- no matter how unpopular that position may be -- serves far more to enhance the clipper's respectability than to diminish her own. 
sci.crypt	 The M code stream might be independently attacked based on knowledge of clipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext. This could be invalidated by changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream and the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure key generator synchronized between endpoints. 
sci.crypt	 My earlier argument that "Clipper will encourage state and local cops to commit criminal acts" is largely moot, now that we've learned that the FBI will perform the actual tap. [It will encourage the *FBI* to commit (even more) criminal acts, but that's not the point here.] 
sci.crypt	 I don't have the wiretap statute handy. But here's what the law says on pen registers. This is all from Title 18 of the U.S. Code. Note how vague S. 3125(a)(1)(B) is.... I haven't had a chance to check out 50 U.S.C. 1801 yet. 
sci.crypt	 Apart from the storage and search requirements, because the evidence is inadmissible: wiretaps require a warrant. And as soon as one such case comes to light, all previous cases are likely to be discovered, and thrown out. There was an article in the NY Times a few months ago about how many convictions in the state might be invalidated because they relied on pen registers -- and the Court of Appeals ruled that pen registers were equivalent to wiretaps, and hence required warrants under New York law. 
sci.crypt	 I agree that notifying your elected officials of your feelings on this (and any other, for that matter) issue is the way to go. And by the way, the phone #s on the list posted the other day were all in Washington D.C. -- For most of you, your elected officials will also maintain a local office in your area code.

sci.crypt	 Thank you very much. After reading the text some distinct questions arised to me, which I guess will also be asked by other people. Perhaps would it be interesting to find an answer to these questions ? 
sci.crypt	 Hate to mess up your point, but it is incredibly easy to learn how to make a nuclear weapon. The hard part is getting the radioactives to put in it. Have you ever read Tom Clancy's _The Sum of All Fears_? It describes in great detail how a Palestinian terrorist group constructed a nuclear bomb using stolen (actually found) plutonium, with some help from an East German nuclear physicist. For some non fiction, read Tom Clancy's article _Five Minutes Till Midnight_. It shows how a terrorist group could construct a nuke using Neptunium, a low grade radioactive waste product dumped in toxic waste sites and forgotten about. He also claims information on constructing a nuke is easily found in any large library. Sounds kind of scary, doesn't it? :-( 
sci.crypt	 Assume in this case the usual canard-adversary of narcotraficantes. They probably have more cash than the KGB did, and they're probably more generous at handing it out. It will be easier than ever to find or cultivate Walkers and Pollards for the keys, and it will be easy enough to find someone to reverse-engineer the chip (unless the tamper proofing is damned clever and effective). 
sci.crypt	 Gee. Say they feed the 80-bit key through Snefru-8 and take the first 60 bits of the result, then use those 60 bits as the real key. How do you figure out that each key is one of 2^20 ``equal'' keys? You can try a birthday attack, but if the key can be changed only once a second then you will need several lifetimes to get reliable statistics. Somehow I don't think you could catch the NSA at this sort of skulduggery. 
sci.crypt	 Here's a simple way to convert the Clipper proposal to an unexceptionable one: Make it voluntary. 
sci.crypt	 around 20,000 T3 trunks (45 Mbit/sec), which is on the order of 10**12 bits/sec. That doesn't even count the amount of traffic in the LOCAL phone companies, or our long-distance competitors. It's about 200 Exabytes tapes / second, which is pretty large even for the NSA :-) 
sci.crypt	 I just found out from my source that this article was a joke. Heh heh.. It seemed pretty damn convincing to me from the start -- I just didn't notice the smiley at the end of the article, and there were a few other hints which I should of caught. 
sci.crypt	 Just a little nitpicking. Wasn't it the government that required a standard railway gauge ? Didn't that improve things ? 
sci.crypt	 I suspect that the decisive element in the political battle will be the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) factor. If the people who would be end users of the Cripple Chip hear of the whole debate only vaguely -- the government says it's solid; other people in the field say it's Swiss cheese -- the balance of doubt could shift against the Feds. Any attempt to limit other forms of encryption could then be presented as the government covering its own butt by protecting its poor product from superior competition. Comments? 
sci.crypt	 My MDC cipher (which uses any one-way hash function as a CFB-mode stream cipher, the current implementation uses MD5) uses a key of up to 2048 bits (that is, you can use a 1-bit key if you want and copy it over the entire 2048-bit range, or you can use the entire 2048 bits). Runtime is independant of key size, the system runs slightly slower than MD5 itself. I presume RC2 and RC4 use a similar system (or possibly they just hash an arbitrary-length key down to n bits, maybe 128, using something like MD5). 
sci.crypt	 People took this article seriously? I mean, I know it's the Net and all, but the prankster didn't even have Clinton's sound-bites right. 
sci.crypt	 Just doing a quick reality check here - is this for real or did someone invent it to provoke a reaction from people? It sounds more like the sort of thing you'd have heard, suitably rephrased, from the leader of a certain German political party in the 1930's.... 
sci.crypt	 I am most embarassed that my irrate, intemperate post is still circulating. 
sci.crypt	 It's all easy with a DSP. The Olivetti Quaderno, for example [*great* 1kg subnotebook/palmtop PC -- sorry for the plug, folks, but Olivetti don't seem to be doing a good job marketing it themselves :-)] includes sound digitisation hardware; they provide vocoders for their DSP which produce varous bit-rates. There's one which gives pretty acceptable voice quality at 13Kbit/sec, just right for a V.32bis modem. 
sci.crypt	 Maybe 300 such pairs suffice to reconstruct S1 and S2? By such a back- door (in the encryption algorithm perhaps) it would be possible (for the manufacturer) to get the keys of all chips that were programmed in one session. This would not, btw, enable anybody else to retrieve the keys in the same way because they'll never get a bunch of 300 (N,U) pairs with identical S1 and S2. (Note that these have to be constant for the whole batch by the very nature of the procedure, i.e., they have to be typed in manually by the `random number supplying agents'!) 
sci.crypt	 You're right, and I retract the suggestion. Still, I wonder. That there are only 60 bits of key information should, in principle, be detectable. Maybe some variant of the tests Rivest et al. did to demonstrate that DES was probably not a group? It should make an interesting paper -- a black-box analysis of a cryptosystem. 
sci.crypt	 Hell, just set up a spark jammer, or some other _very_ electrically-noisy device. Or build an active Farrady cage around the room, with a "noise" signal piped into it. While these measures will not totally mask the emissions of your equipment, they will provide sufficient interference to make remote monitoring a chancy proposition, at best. There is, of course, the consideration that these measures may (and almost cretainly will) cause a certain amount of interference in your own systems. It's a matter of balancing security versus convenience. 
sci.crypt	 The recent discussion in this news group suggests that a key search attack against DES is quite feasible now. But normally DES is applied in CBC or CFB mode where one chooses a random init vector of 8 bytes. Questions: 
sci.crypt	 Mr. Ward, before you start blathering about your skill "interpreting" the Constitution, it might be helpful to learn to read. After a review with a high school English teacher emphasizing participial phrases, you might start with the Second Amendment, and follow it up with: 
sci.crypt	 Quoting pmetzger@snark.shearson.com (Perry E. Metzger) in article <1993Apr21.012011.27470@shearson.com: Whats the difference between a V.32bis modem and a V.32bis modem? 
sci.crypt	 If "I forgot" doesn't have as much credibility as you'd like, consider this alternative. Somewhere on the hard disk, duplicated a few times, keep a 128-bit random number. When the 128-bit digest of your passphrase is computed, it is XORred with the random number before being used as the key for your hard disk. Writing random junk over the random numbers makes the hard disk unreadable by anyone. 
sci.crypt	 On the contrary- The Walker spy case is one where the KGB was given keys (as I recall) 
sci.crypt	 IMHO, encryption is (also) protected under the SECOND amendment of the Constitution of the United States. 
sci.crypt	 disturbing trend in some of the E-mail and posts I've tossing back and forth. 
sci.crypt	 We've got a tempest receiver in the lab here, and there's no difficulty in picking up individual monitors. Their engineering tolerances are slack enough that they tend to radiate on different frequencies. Even where they overlap, you can discriminate because they have different line synch frequencies - you can lock in on one and average the others out. 
sci.crypt	 First of all, the chip doesn't do that. It runs at 16 megabits/second, which is far beyond what you need for voice. It's obviously intended for data as well, and on high-speed lines at that. 
sci.crypt	 The only theory that makes any sense is that S1 and S2 are either the same for all chips, or vary among very few possibilities, so that anyone trying to break the encryption by brute force need only plow through the possible serial numbers (2^30, about one billion), multiplied by the number of different S1, S2 combinations. 
sci.crypt	 Someone in Canada asked me to send him some public domain DES file encryption code I have. Is it legal for me to send it? 
sci.crypt	 I think it is unlikely that data like this could be used in court. Currently LEAs can install wiretaps on large numbers of phones, record calls without listening to them, and then post-facto obtain warrants and listen to calls after probable cause is established. But this strategy wouldn't get the stuff admitted in court. (At least, not in the near term.) 
sci.crypt	 I am testing IDEA block cipher implementations for correctness and needs some golden test vectors. I've looked through the postscript IDEA chapter but the single example gives me zero degrees of freedom. I'll contact the inventor if necessary but since we are NOT paying him money for use of his invention, I'd like to offload this from him. Anybody got vectors? (No disease vectors, please). 
sci.crypt	 Sigh... my version of 'rn' asked me whether I really want to send this posting! 
sci.crypt	 Standard "voice" circuits run at 56kbps inter-exchange in the US. Therefore, you need to achieve 4:1 to get standard voice quality. 
sci.crypt	 This is a very good point. AT&T obviously knew and participated in the development of the Clipper chip. This amounts to unfair business practice and gives AT&T an early monopoly on the market [hopefully a non-existant market]. Other companies that compete with AT&T in the cellular market (Motorola, NEC, etc) have grounds to file a complaint over this. 
sci.crypt	 Looking for PostScript or Tex version of a paper called: "PUBLIC-KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY" 
sci.crypt	 Not me -- which is precisely why the government must be cut off at the knees when it pulls stunts like this, lest the situation worsen to the point where extreme measures are required. 
sci.crypt	 The average amerikan today seems to think that the government should be able to eavesdrop on everyone (else). Opinion polls show that most people belive the Bill of Rights to grant too much freedom to people, when it is not identified as such (BTW, if anyone knows of a cite for that, I'd love to have it). Not only does this mean that these people are willing to give up everyone (else's) rights, they don't even know what the Bill of Rights actually says. 
sci.crypt	 I have an idea as to why the encryption algorithm needs to be keep secret, and some things that i think it implies. (Of course these could all be wrong.....) 
sci.crypt	 Of course they take care of their own ... very well ... until the person has 'outlived his/her/undefined usefulness'... then 'elimination' becomes a consideration... :-) 
sci.crypt	 Taking this at face value (though it seems quite dissonant with much else that has been published here about brute force DES cracking, unless Russell was lucky with respect to the key), I'd be very interested in whether the program Russell used is available? 
sci.crypt	 It also falls within the purview of the ACLU, but that doesn't mean the ACLU (or the EFF) would be the most effective instrument to "win the hearts and minds" in favor of access to cryptography. 
sci.crypt	 I like it. PGP would be useful, I guess. Although I don't have a working version for VMS yet... :-( 
sci.crypt	 Well, after a lot of trawling through archives, I found the post I reproduce in full below. Is it time to get together to develop a tcp/ip standard for crypto voice that we could then layer on point-to-point SLIP as *the* free standard for crypto voice like pgp is for mail? 
sci.crypt	 My choice for the escow house would be the Smithsonian, and someplace on the west coast. My biggest concern isn't that the escrow house could be compromised (it will be), but the fact it has been compromised will be kept secret. 
sci.crypt	 I've posted some info on CELP coding on sci.crypt. Looks like you can squeeze speech into 4000bps if you have a fast enough computer like a sparcstation (or a Newton with the Acorn Risc Machine in it :-) ) 
sci.crypt	 If the administration *really* believes big-time drug dealers are the threat (personally I thought it was the CIA and the air force that did all the real drug shipping :-) ) then they *ought* to take this seriously: unlike the KGB, drug dealers can make a most convincing argument for cooperation: "help us and we'll be nice and give you some money, don't help us and we'll start cutting off your favourite body parts" 
sci.crypt	 The points raised about checking what is actually -in- the chip, as opposed to what is allegedly programmed therein, raise yet another trust issue. Even if we assume that these "trusted agents" are really entering a wide range of S1 and S2 seeds (rather than using the same one all the time to reduce the key search space to 30 bits), I assume they are not doing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry at carefully selected points to encode data. They would presumably be punching numbers into a computer, which for all they know could program the chips in a manner completely independent of the S1 and S2 values they are feeding into the system. 
sci.crypt	 Codecs. They have to get about 6:1 compression on 8 bit samples to squeeze them down v32bis. I played around with the lossless 'shorten' program last night, but it only managed 2.5:1. I've got some specimen CELP code but it's not obvious that it runs in real time; I think it's just proof-of- concept code, and I have some mucking about with file formats to do before I can put my own sample through it.

sci.electronics	 First of all, realize that Tesla invented AC power generators, motors, transformers, conductors, etc. Technically, *ALL* transformers are Tesla coils. In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean an "air core resonant transformer". The TV flyback version Tesla coil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for diagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called "Oscillating Shuttle Circuit" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly efficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors, which are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active reactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve efficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core resonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI for wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil from it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all Tesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter and die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind to a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat, gas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and telegraph for communication. Is that real world enough for you???????

sci.electronics	 Thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and I am looking at using a couple of the ideas. I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil. spec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C and sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time delay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this application, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is disabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset. When triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x the timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can be programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it is, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K resistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of 2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !) Of course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for 256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'. After the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14 day timing cycle and so forth. 
sci.electronics	 I'm still not sure how this is supposed to work, since the .ZIP files took up about 2.5Mb, so it must be a tight squeeze on those floppies... 
sci.electronics	 Perhaps you're using the wrong brand! (Sorry all HP fans, but I have a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their (excellent) gear). 
sci.electronics	 I have a stereo compressor-limiter by Audio Logic (Model MT-66). The gates work, but the compressor seems to be gone on one channel, and very weak on the other. 
sci.electronics	 I'm trying to figure out how to operate a Pioneer Laserdisc LD-1000 that I bought at a surplus store. It is reputedly from some kind of computerised viewing and/or ordering system. THere is what may be an HPIB connector on the back. When I power it up, the front panel power light comes on, but no activity, and the door doesn't open. Anyone have any experience with this unit or any ideas on how to obtain documentation? 
sci.electronics	 Firstly, I would never consider trying to make a one-shot timer. Your 2F2 cap will have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their performance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap. The other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances, so calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering the cold). 
sci.electronics	 From what I know, protection is necessary, esp. if you plan to route the cables into an unknown environment (out of your control). Things like accidental shorts between the signal lines and power cables, or even lightning strikes are very likely and I don't think you like to see the sight of your computer going up in smoke! [Even ethernet cards are protected. I've looked at the one in my PC and the connector is protected by a gas discharge tube!] 
sci.electronics	 RS Components (they exist in Australia and the UK. Don't know about the US) have little chips called Isolated MAX 250 and 251. They give you isolated RS-232 from a single 5V supply. External components are 4 caps, 4 optoisolators, a diode, and an isloting transformer. They go up to 19.2K baud.. 
sci.electronics	 I didn't hear the tell-tale cracking that indicated HV at work, nor are the filaments at the far end of the tube glowing orange, just nothing. 
sci.electronics	 mechanically resonating device, extreme cold is likely to affect the compliance (?terminology?) of the quartz, and hence its resonant frequency. 
sci.electronics	 The HC711 is an EPROM version of the HC11. Raw HC11 parts have factory set ROM images, and as such are useless to the hobbyist. HC811 parts have EEPROM, allowing for electrical erasure and reprogramming. 
sci.electronics	 The subject line says it all. I'm working on a project that will use a car battery. I need to pull off 3V and possibly 48V at 3A. 
sci.electronics	 Sounds like a job for a universal time reciever. I don't know the logisitics of the situation, but if you could just place a reciever in snow and place the oscillator in a nice lab somewhere else, your problems should be solved. Just a suggestion. 
sci.electronics	 B ) Votre host est mal configure... <<<<<<<<<<<< 
sci.electronics	 Fortunately, wire-wrapping is a better wiring technique than most at high frequencies; Cray computers (up to the X-MP, at least) all had wirewrapped backplanes. Wirewrap gets into trouble at much higher frequencies than any TTL can handle. The 'increase' of wiring capacitance is not really relevant (you have to use transmission line techniques, and the capacitance is no problem). 
sci.electronics	 What you have is one of the LD players from a video game (Dragon's Lair, Space Ace, etc). Call Pioneer Technicial Support 213-498-0300 (at least that's the number I called them at) and ask for the LD-V1000 Interface Guide. It shows how the parallel interface should be wired and the codes for the commands (play, pause, reject, etc). The guide is mainly for hooking the player to a computer, but with a little work, you could build a wired controller. 
sci.electronics	 Yes, I know it's nowhere near Christmas time, but I'm gonna loose Net access in a few days (maybe a week or 2 if I'm lucky), and wanted to post this for interested people to save 'till Xmas. :-( Note: Bell Labs is a good place IF you have a PhD and a good boss, I have neither. 
sci.electronics	 Hello netters:) Does anyone out there know any FTP sites for projects, plans, etc of an electrical nature? 
sci.electronics	 We've just been donated a large machine for use in our robotics lab. This device is complete with a 286 based controller, running the Intel RMX operating system. 
sci.electronics	 Good gravy! Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in any ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference power, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which should also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms in an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted notation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of the circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude* (rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted reference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB. So. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation such as 'dBm' has an explicit reference. 
sci.electronics	 I've found this works pretty well on noisy laminated power transformer cores and windings (the 60Hz kind). Likewise, if anybody has tried this on a flyback I'd like to hear about it. 
sci.electronics	 I believe that the "A-D converters" found on a joystick port are really timers that tick off how long it takes an R-C circuit (the R being your paddle) to charge up to something like 1/2 Vcc. For games this works pretty well, but you certainly wouldn't want to try to take lab measurements off something as non-linear as that. 
sci.electronics	 I want to convert a 500 Volt sinewave with frequency between 1 kHz and 10 kHz, to a 10 Volt sinewave with the same frequency, by means of a transformer. The secondary current will be .6 A (600 mA). 
sci.electronics	 Bob is indeed correct here in more than one way. A look in the old RCA picture tube manual backs this up, as does SAMS Reference Data handbook. The internal coating around the perimeter of the CRT (not the aluminum or tin CRT face coating) is referred to as a "dag" as well as the outer coating. 
sci.electronics	 Why not try one of the projects to build a DAC connected to the parallel port as documented in some files which come with modplay ? These vary from a 4 DAC design to a simple single DAC made only of resistors.-- David Hembrow EO Europe Ltd., email: dhembrow@eoe.co.uk Abberley House, Granhams Road, Great Shelford, Cambridge CB2 5LQ, England 
sci.electronics	 Does anyone out there have the toll-free (catalog request and order line) for Heathkit/Zenith? Please post the number if you've got it! Thanks. 
sci.electronics	 If you can find a copy of "8088 Assembler Language Programming: The IBM PC" by Willen and Krantz, 2nd ed. pub. by Sams, there is a discussion of the game control adapter, monostable multivibrators, and conversion to other uses, as well as an assembler program. If you need greater accuracy, there is no reason you couldn't modify the approach to suit your needs. 
sci.electronics	 I too would be interested in ANY information on the subject of programing PALS etc..... 
sci.electronics	 From what I have read about these little gadgets, it works on a electrochemical galvanic principle. The sensing unit has a chemical matrix which produces an electrical voltage proportional to the amount of chemical compound it is designed for ... in this case I believe it is the Hydroxyl group??? 
sci.electronics	 I need a off-the-shelf method of transmitting small amounts of data up to 300 feet. The data is low speed and can be encoded as needed. Low power on the transmitting end would be a plus. An FCC certified product would be prefered. 
sci.electronics	 Yes, but in a fairly reproducible way. -40 is only a smidgen of the distance to absolute zero. And in any case you're going to have to borrow freezer space from a bio lab or someone to test/calibrate this darling anyway. Btw, you're probably going to want those big capacitors you found to fire the solenoid -- High current drain on frozen batteries can be an ugly thing. 
sci.electronics	 No, it is independent of the speedometer. The gun processes two doppler returns--the speed of the car relative to the pavement and the speed of the target, taking the difference between the two. Some guns with a "moving mode" actually have a split beam with one beam aimed preferentially at the pavement. 
sci.electronics	 I'm looking to build a DSP for guitar processing. Hence lots of background information would be really useful !

sci.electronics	 I've never seen a speedometer-reading model. Are you sure? Who makes them? Consider the difficulty of reading the speedo on various makes of cars in use... I've seen single beam moving-mode and split beam moving-mode. 
sci.electronics	 Permit me to quote fragments of' "praetzel@sunee.uwaterloo.ca's article out of context. 
sci.electronics	 Why are you fooling around with analog for this job? A single chip micro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily. An 8748 only costs about $5. That and a $1 crystal and you're in business. Embed the whole thing in a foam insulated blanket, power it from a solar cell, use the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely on the insulation to hold the heat during darkness. If you don't want to try thermal management, contact someone like ICL and have them cut you a special low temperature crystal. It'll cost at most $20. 
sci.electronics	 They detect the oscillator operating in the detector. Saw a story about their use in Canada. Now don't go putting oscillators in your cars... :-) 
sci.electronics	 Hi. I'm looking for software to aid a friend of mine with designing speakers. Does this type of software exist? If anyone can point me toward a shareware or freeware product with this description, that would be ideal. 
sci.electronics	 Power lines and airplanes don't mix. In areas where lines are strung very high, or where a lot of crop dusting takes place, or where there is danger of airplanes flying into the lines, they place these plastic balls on the lines so they are easier to spot.

sci.electronics	 I think the hangup with digital scopes is that you have to know so much more about them and how they work on a scope-by-scope basis, and some of the functions are typically presented, in my opinion, in a counter-intuitive fashion (HP has made some strides in their 54600 series, IMO). Automatic setups are fine for simple, repetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more complex events where you need to understand how the scope is actually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope in "equivalent time" or in "real time" sampling mode (equivalent time being a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to the trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual sampling rate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but before display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope. 
sci.electronics	 This is for a friend of mine. Please send answers directly to him (E-Mail adress see below )! 
sci.electronics	 Actually, I think J. Chiu knows the score and is just being silly. However, "decibel" is in fact 1/10th of a bel. He is right on that one, but I don't know if it was accidental or not. 
sci.electronics	 I've seen several references to split- or separate-beam radars, which I claimed didn't exist. Gotta eat some crow here - I wasn't aware of them. All I really knew was that it can be done with one beam. 
sci.electronics	 Here's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or contribution to: 
sci.electronics	 Here in the UK, the bandwidth restriction apparently only apply to local lines.. ie those used by the average domestic client. Private lines which are run from the local exchange to the leasing client are usually capable of a higher bandwidth if the exchange is digital. 
sci.electronics	 Have anyone some idea about how to build a cheap, low resolution (or high :-) video projector... 
sci.electronics	 Well, I'm not sure I'd use this to process a guitar but there was a audio filter DSP construction article in the Sept 92 issue of QST magazine (Ham Radio oriented). The DSP is available in kit form for about $120. 
sci.electronics	 Is there a fast 'n dirty way to kill the line spiking that occurs when an inductive load is turned on sometime other than at zero-crossing of the AC cycle? A capacitor kludged in somehow, etc? 
sci.electronics	 Obviously the police officer reads the speedometer. I cannot believe the nit-picking in this group. There's 2 beams, there is not, is too, etc.... 
sci.electronics	 From what I understand about radar dectectors all they are is a passive device much like the radio in your car. They work as an antenna picking up that radar signals that the radar gun sends out. Therefore there would be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of detecting whether some one had a radio in their car. 
sci.electronics	 There are two more reasons to save old databooks and then beyond two years--obsoleted parts and better application notes and tutorials. 
sci.electronics	 I need information on microstrip circuit design especially filter design for the 1-3GHz range. Can you recommend any good books, journals, or microstrip circuit design software. 
sci.electronics	 The best info I have seen so far is the article "Joystick Metrics: Measuring physical properties through the PC's joystick port" by Michael Covington in the May 1985 issue of PC Tech Journal. It talks about how to read all kinds of things (voltage, current, resistance) in BASIC, and even includes code for a simple "oscilloscope" display. 
sci.electronics	 I was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when I came across a range of Peltier Effect heat pumps intended for cooling components. For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a current through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side to the other. Reverse the current and you reverse the effect. I think a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well. 
sci.electronics	 Brad, For an antenna, gain is synonymous with directionality. The only way to get gain (1) out of an antenna is to design in directionality. The "gain" of an antenna is defined as the signal increase (for a preferred direction) over the signal obtained by an isotropic antenna. 
sci.electronics	 just a suggestion: take a motorola mc14536B set it up to give you a pulse once every sec or ten secs with either a RC or xtal clock input. then feed to a MC14521B as clock input and decode output for 1,209,600 sec output ,might have to add a few 'and' gates or decoder chips to get output and reset pulse back to the'521 to restart cycle... Trigger a oneshot from the decoded riseing edge ;the one shot then goes to a mosfet to drive the mechanism to fire the pellet launcher.. these ckts require uAmps of current,between 5 - 15 volts, so a 12 volt gel cell of a few Amphours would last the six weeks. Then take the ckt board & battery wrap in 3" or 4" of foam or build a box of out of the stuff...with plywood or metal exterior... build a small heater out of 10-50 Watt resistors in series to keep the battery and ckts warm. 2nd thought use 2 batteries one for heater one for timer and pellet trigger. 
sci.electronics	 I think there is a huge difference in the materials and process for printer/toner PCB's. I get first time, everytime results from a local HP Postscript, and hardly ever works from copies of the same artwork. The printer results are so good that I have quit even looking for PC board processes. If I had to use the copier version, I would think I would look elsewhere. The moral? Experiment and find what works. Toner transfer CAN give excellent results. It, like any process, gives erratic results with variable inputs. 
sci.electronics	 I got a question from my dad which I really can't answer and I'd appreciate some net.wisdom. 
sci.electronics	 I've got an rgb Mistubishi monitor and on the back it has 5 BNC connectors labeled like this: 
sci.electronics	 Unfortunately, you're wrong on both counts. The most common method of implementing a tunable receiver is to have a local oscillator. The local oscillator's frequency can be radiated out of the receiver via the antenna unless the circuit is designed and constructed with great care. 
sci.electronics	 So-Called Cool-Hot boxes have been advetised for several years. I recall Damark advertising them in a recent catalog. Problem with the units is they do a sh***y job of keeping food cold/warm. The peliter devices used just don't seem to have enough punch to keep up. If you want something hot, you need to heat it up before you put it in the box, and end up hours later with food thats only moderately warm. Same goes for cold items. 
sci.electronics	 I am looking at buying a low cost (< $500) scope for general purpose use. Any recommendations? Is this info in a faq somewhere? Any pointers appreciated. Thanks, -Gerard. 
sci.electronics	 I would like to be able to amplify a voltage signal which is output from a thermocouple, preferably by a factor of 100 or 1000 ---- so that the resulting voltage can be fed more easily into a personal-computer-based ADC data acquisition card. 
sci.electronics	 Hi all, I've been following this thread about jacob's ladder for a few weeks and I happened to come across one of the best project books that I've seen in a while. The book "Gadgeteer's Goldmine" by Gordon McComb offers over 55 excellent low cost projects including: Jacob's Ladder, tesla coils, plasma spheres, a Van de Graaff generator, robots, an IR scope, and several laser projects. The instructions come with complete part lists, warnings and diagrams. For those of you who are interested in building any of the above listed projects, you should seriously consider getting this book. The paperback version is only $19.95 too. 
sci.electronics	 That's completely inaccurate. The ohm was an original standard made equal to a the resistance of a standardized electric stove heating element. That's where the song "Ohm on the Range" came from, of course. --scott 
sci.electronics	 I think those are to make the lines more visible to airplanes and helicopters... cheaper than blinking red lights. 
sci.electronics	 I have a HP 1740 scope that (I think) has a problem in the HV section. Symptom: started turning on and off on its own, making intermittant bright flashes on the CRT, and then finally, passed away. If you have a manual (or any suggestions), please send me mail. Will gladly pay reproduction/shipping costs plus a little $ for your efforts for the manual. Thanks in advance. 
sci.electronics	 DAMN RIGHT it doesn't! Ohm's come from the greek letter omega, which is used for resistance/impedance. 
sci.electronics	 Sometimes. It depends on your monitor and your timing. If you don't have enough vertical front porch and you use XOR composite sync you can get even/odd tearing at the top of the screen, which is very sensitive to the HHOLD control. It looks like what you would expect if you scanned the even fields (say) onto a sheet of mylar and had pinched the upper left corner with your fingers and started to tear it off the tube. With proper composite sync (equalizing pulses) the interlace is rock solid. 
sci.electronics	 If you're thinking of reactive polymers they're making ESD safe contaux08iners out of it. As far as being conductive goes anything with a resistance less than 10 to the fouthx08x08rth power ohms per cubic measure is classed as conductive per MIL-STD-1686 for ESD protection. My $0.02 ($0.016 US). 
sci.electronics	 From my rather rusty knowledge of radio, most radio receivers use a superhet circuit, so that the incoming signal is mixed with a local oscillator, giving a fixed intermediate frequency (IF) that is more easily amplified. The detector detectors work by picking up IF re-radiated from your radar detector. In Britain, where one has/used to pay for a TV licence, there are/were TV detector vans prowling the streets, looking for people who hadn't paid their licence fee. They had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the roof, and I believe could triangulate an operating TV from the IF. 
sci.electronics	 Do you know if there is an airport nearby? They may just be markers to tell pilots of small planes that there are power lines nearby. 
sci.electronics	 OK, I've asked this before, and with a new thread on these lines, I ask this again: 
sci.electronics	 My impression -- it's not an area I've played with much -- is that the much-beloved NE567 is basically obsolete. If you want to detect a 1kHz tone, set a switched-capacitor filter chip to that frequency, feed your input to it, and see if anything comes out the other end. The NE567 was what you used when good clean bandpass filters were hard to do; nowadays they're easy, and the results are better. 
sci.electronics	 Does anyone out there know of any products using Motorola's Neuron(r) chips MC143150 or MC143120. If so, what are they and are they utilizing Standard Network Variable Types (SNVT)? _________________________________________________________________________________ 
sci.electronics	 I just got an IBM-PC XT with no documents. Its a true IBM, and I was wondering if anyone had the definitions of the 2 8 position dip switches? 
sci.electronics	 Umm, when I was doing sound reinforcement for a living, I used to get direct boxes (which convert unbalanced 1/4" jacks to balanced XLRs) for about $25 each, or a little more for higher quality. You'll need two for a stereo signal, of course, and a little adapter thingy from Radio Sh#$&^t to convert from RCA to 1/4". Total cost should be around $50. You can also buy transformers for quite a bit less and wire them yourself. Total cost there should be under $30. You can get all this stuff from any pro music shop that sells sound reinforcement gear. The benefit? NO noise that you can hear will be generated in the cables going to the component with the balanced inputs, even when you run them in bad places, like next to power lines. 
sci.electronics	 If you're going to do the series Diode thing (which is the easiest), just make sure that the LED can take the current (I can't recall it off-hand, but it's something like 100mA or more?) 
sci.electronics	 I have a new scope and I thought I'd save a few bucks by buying one with a function generator built in. After having it awhile I noticed two things about the function generator. For one, there seems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset' is pushed in. That is, I have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some random 50mV bias. The other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output won't go below about 1V p-p. I am a student ( you may have guessed from my previous posts ), and I often have to measure the input impedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits have maximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most have input impedances in the 10's of Kohm range. The thing is, in order to use my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing reasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my circuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series. With the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but now with this little divider there I have to figure that in. It's kind of a pain in the ass. Is there any way I could make myself a little box that could solve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generator input, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some low, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factor of one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but I'd like to have this box not be active. Any quick ideas. The scope's not broken. For other reasons I had sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it. The function generator was the same way on that one, too. 
sci.electronics	 As the subject says - Can I use a 4052 for digital signals? I don't see why it couldn't handle digital signals, but I could be wrong. Anyone have any advice? Thanks. 
sci.electronics	 Here in Erie, PA there is a system in the inner city called Rado-Lite (a trade name) which allows police and ambulance vehicles to gain right of way by controlling traffic lights through RADIO signals. The receivers look much like what you describe, but they include a UHF whip antenna (less than a foot tall) and a light which flashes on and off to let traffic know that an emergency vehicle has taken control and is approaching. Local folklore says this system was invented here; I don't know if this company has any other installations. It has been in operation for at least 30 years, going only by my memory. 
sci.electronics	 Greetings. I received a reply stating that unless someone else confirms that the following company is operating, I should remove it from my lst: 
sci.electronics	 This is not news. In fact it's where I got the idea from, since it was such a neat item. Mattell made it, I believe, modeled after a "space saber" or "light sword" or something likewise theme-y. My addition was using a motor for continuous display, and polar effects in addition to character graphics. I should have protected it when I had the chance. No one to kick but myself... 
sci.electronics	 I'm no expert at UPS's, but you said something that made it sound like you didn't realize something. On a typical UPS (well, on ours, anyway), there is NO switchover from AC to DC. All the protected equipment is ALWAYS running from the batteries (via an inverter), with the usual condition of also having them on charge. If the power fails, big deal - the computers never see it (until the batteries start to droop, but there's something like 60 car-sized batteries in that cabinet, so it takes a while). 
sci.electronics	 I had a GE Emerson 13" color TV for about 3 years and one fine day, while we were watching something (I doubt if the program was the cause), we heard a mild explosion. Our screen went blank but there was sound, so we thought, 'oh we have special effects on the program'. But soon the sound stopped and smoke started to appear at the back of the TV. The brilliant EEs we are, we unplugged the TV and called customer service only to be thrown around by please hold, I will transfer u to blah blah.. Finally we abandoned the idea of trying to fix the TV and got a new one (we wanted a bigger one too!). After all the story, what I wanted to know is: Is my problem an isolated incident or a common one? (I recall reading about Russian TVs exploding, but not here, in the US). Why would the picture tube explode or even smoke? I still have the left over TV set, I might dig into it this summer. Any idea where I can get parts for these things? (probably will cost more than TV). 
sci.electronics	 Of course you could develope this system, but there is already a system called Global Positioning Satellites. It gives three dimensional coordinates anywhere on earth. Many surveyors use this system with a differential receiver/transmitter to get coordinates within centimeters. Basic receivers with resolution of a few meters (on a good day) are available from many sources. 
sci.electronics	 1. Can low Voltage lights be controlled with an X10 module by putting it before the transformer? It seems to work, even the dimmer works. Not very reliable. Will it damage the module? Can it be done reliably? 
sci.electronics	 Hmm... now where was that ad for the combination radio/hand cranked generator/flashlight/siren I saw? :-) 
sci.electronics	 I suggest that misc.consumer.house is a better forum for this, several electricians, a huge FAQ that adresses ALL the issues raised here. 
sci.electronics	 I'm doing sound for a couple of bands around here and we need Direct Input boxes for the keyboards. These are the little boxes that take a line level out of the keyboard and transform it into low-Z for the run to the mixer. Sadly they cost like $50 (or more) each and I'm going to need like 5 or 10 of them! I looked inside one (belonging to another band) and it looks like just a transformer. Does anyone have any plans for building them? Perhaps in Anderton's "Electronic Projects for Musicians" book (which I am having a hell of a time tracking down...)? 
sci.electronics	 There SHOULD be a connection of the GROUND wire to a ground in the breaker box. There also should be a connection of the NEUTRAL wire to a ground in the breaker box. There should be no other place in the building where such a connection occurs (i.e. not in any of the outlet boxes). 
sci.electronics	 Since the digital transmission schemes include error correction and concealment, the performance remains about the same down to a very low carrier-to-noise ratio, below which it degrades very quickly. Hence, digitally compressed TV is supposed to be less susceptible to interference than amplitude modulated TV. 
sci.electronics	 I had the insturment panel go out in my car (a 1990 Lincoln Contenintal) which is a digital dash. They replaced the whole thing with a 1991 dash (thank god it was under the warrenty ! :-) Anyway, the odometer was reading the exact milage from the old panel. It must have a EEPROM of some sort in it that is up-dated. Seems to me that removing the battery would erase it, but it doesn't. So I guess they swapped the NVM chip (non-volitile memory) and installed it in the new dash. No, they wouldn't let me have the old dash to tinker with :-( 
sci.electronics	 Now there's a good idea ! All you need is 20 amps DC for a few minutes, and a good (wetware) memory (was I using wp or autocad or ...). I thought of the same idea myself a few days ago. I've got a fairly new car battery that I take along in my 4x4 when I go camping, and it sits around useless when I'm home. I wish I could get a batteryless ups to use it with, or use it with a heavy duty 5-volt regulator to supply the PC. But I guess you'd need -5v and -12v (and +12) too (2 more batteries ?). 
sci.electronics	 Or, if you've got some entreprenuerial (sp?) spirit, get a cheapy clear plastic box, mount the simm inside, and sell it as a 'Pet SIMM'! 
sci.electronics	 No need to be sorry, I blew it on this one. At the main breaker box where there is a thick wire ground leading to the earth, both neutral and ground are hooked to this bus. In any other breaker box (or an outlet box, etc.) the ground and neutral must not be connected together. 
sci.electronics	 What is happening is this: 1) You turn the TV on. 2) The horizontal output begins normal operation. This powers up the high voltage and most of the rest of the circuitry. 3) A problem is sensed and the horizontal oscillator shuts down. 4) After it powers down the cycle repeats.

sci.electronics	 Pardon me, but why would carbon-zinc cells have any lead in them at all. --scott 
sci.electronics	 Well, one reason for getting conflicting answers is that it depends on what you want the ground plane to do. A continuous conductor is a good electrostatic shield. Do you have signals on your board that need shielding rom other things? This shielding won't do much good for magnetic fields, unless you make it continuous around the circuit to be shielded, like a Faraday cage. 
sci.electronics	 Yes, but they don't look appropriate. I much prefer used 833 tubes on my tree. --scott 
sci.electronics	 Without doing anything really tricky, the best I've seen is the Burr-Brown INA103. Their databook shows a good application of this chip as a phantom power mic pre. 
sci.electronics	 LBL now offers ethernet support also, although presently it is limited to NE1000/NE2000 style boards. LBL owners can get an update for $8.50. 
sci.electronics	 We have a Sun CD-ROM drive which I would like to play audio CD's in. I have an old 10 watt amplifier which works fine when connected to a junk "Walkman" style AM/FM radio. This amp ties the common path of the earphone connection to ground. 
sci.electronics	 Ok, so your a HAM. Well, tune in 10.7Mhz or 455Khz. These numbers sound like some you have herd before? Thats right, you guessed it, they are common IF numbers. Every Super-Het receiver has a local oscillator(s) which generates an IF. This is what your detector detector is detecting (the local oscillator). 
sci.electronics	 Hi. I was doing research on subliminal suggestion for a psychology paper, and I read that one researcher flashed hidden messages on the TV screen at 1/200ths of a second. Is that possible? I thought the maximum rate the TV was even capable of displaying images was 1/30th of a second. (or 1/60th of a second for an image composed of only odd or even scan lines) 
sci.electronics	 I've got two lines coming into my apartment. Two different telephone numbers. When I ordered the second line installed, instead of bringing out another 4 wire bundle, the telco just connected up to my yellow and black wires. So I have one line on red & green and the other on yellow & black. 
sci.electronics	 One week to the Robot Olympic games. Fire up the mechanoids for combat and come on down. 
sci.electronics	 I was wondering if anyone can shed any light on just how it is that these electronic odometers remember the total elapsed mileage? What kind of memory is stable/reliable enough, non-volatile enough and independent enough (of outside battery power) to last say, 10 years or more, in the life of a vehicle? I'm amazed that anything like this could be expected to work for this length of time (especially in light of all the gizmos I work with that are doing good to work for 2 months without breaking down somehow). 
sci.electronics	 Anyone out there in netland have a spare data pod or two from an old 1615A Hewlett Packard logic analyzer? If you do, I'd like to buy it off of you. The pod's part number is 10248B. 
sci.electronics	 Sounds like the picture tube lost vacuum. This would cause the filament to ignite and could actually turn the tube from a vacuum to a pressure vessel, followed by an explosion when the neck assembly (mostly likely cracked to begin with) blows off. During the whole sequence of events, the other circuits may continue functioning, which accounts for not losing sound. 
sci.electronics	 Greetings. I've been seeing the word "storage" mentioned around oscilliscopes but I'm curious, what does it mean? 
sci.electronics	 My experience is that the CD drawer becomes a bit loose, and the CD either skips or can't be read. Try seeing if all the screws that hold down the drawer assembly are tightened properly. Other than that, my next guess would be one of the motors. Hope this helps. Dave Haans, Laurentian University, Sudbury, Ontario. 
sci.electronics	 Like most high-volume manufacturers, Adcom has most of its PC boards assembled off-shore (in their case, mostly in the far east). Final assembly _and testing_ are done in East Brunswick. 
sci.electronics	 Careful now folks... Also consider the 90VAC+ @20Hz that is forced on ring and tip when the phone's supposed to ring! Even with a simple zener and LED setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick. Whatever scheme you use, make sure you've got at least 200V-rated components on the frontend. 
sci.electronics	 Actually, it's a bit more complicated than that...I sounds to me, your UPS takes in AC, rectifies it to DC to charge the batteries, and then takes the battery DC and chops it to AC again, feeding your equipment. This approach is the easiest and cleanest way to switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since, as you mentioned, nothing will know about what happened down the line. 
sci.electronics	 Heh, heh, heh, heh....I laugh because I have the same damn TV, and it did the same thing! Actually it is a Goldstar, but it's essentially the same TV and electronics--just a different face plate and name. 
sci.electronics	 Might be a good idea... The resolution you requested is about 0.3mV In order to get what you've paid for, noise level better be lower than that. It is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect inside a PC. 
sci.electronics	 Yes some radar detectors are less detectable by radar detector detectors. ;-) 
sci.electronics	 My very favorite ad for such a device is on the back of the latest Damark catalog. Quoting from memory: 
sci.electronics	 You've got the oscilliscope, so you connect it up to the sensor wire and measure this stuff. That way you know what it expects. 
sci.electronics	 Wow, what a concept! Does anybody want to speculate on how this "non-connection" would fit into the theft of cable services laws? It seems to me that unless this case is specifically written into the legislation that the cable company would not have a leg to stand upon in court. 
sci.electronics	 Does anyone have some information on the relative fraction of the final cost of each component in an average hard drive? For instance, I'm pretty sure the heads and the platters are the most expensive parts, with the assembly costs running a close third. Cost of the electronics is likely in the noise. Any hard numbers ($$ or percentage)? Thanks. 
sci.electronics	 They are illegal here in Manitoba as well though I don't know what methods are used to detect them. 
sci.electronics	 First, it will not pass a National Electrical code inspection. Secondly, The neutral wire is current carrying and the ground wire shouldn't be, or only during a fault condition. 
sci.electronics	 I really don't know where to post this question so I figured that this board would be most appropriate. I was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that are ever present at nuclear poer sites. They look like cylinders that have been pinched in the middle. Does anybody know what the actual purpose of those things are?. I hear that they're called 'Cooling Towers' but what the heck do they cool? I hope someone can help 
sci.electronics	 Since electrical wiring questions do turn up from time to time on in electronics), I am hijacking the following FAQ and posting a copy here. 
sci.electronics	 Water. Nuclear stations don't generate electricity directly from the reactor, they use the reactor to generate heat. The heat is then used to heat water just as in a conventional oil or coal station, and the resultant steam drives the turbines. 
sci.electronics	 And if it's not quick and dirty, you can get bus bars that are stamped out with leads that insert in the PC board. 
sci.electronics	 Is there another book. I have this one and don't find it helpfull in learning Spice. It would make a good reference book but I found it lacking for learning Spice. Are there any others? 
sci.electronics	 An Easy way to solve the problem is to use two op-amps to form the balanced low-Z output, but this solution does not provide any galvanic isolation between keyboard (or whatever plugged) and mixer. If no tight requiremets are demanded and some hum, snap, crackle and pop sounds (formed by ground loops) can be tolerated, the op-amp solution is just what you are looking for! (It is cheap...somewhat $10/DI-box). Not sure, but Craig Anderton did introduce one DI-box project in Guitar Player mag years ago (transformerless)..... 
sci.electronics	 This is indeed one function, but more sophisticated ones do level control and ground-lift (separating the keyboard and mixer earths) aswell. 
sci.electronics	 I've had very good results from the SSM2016 from PMI (part of Analogue Devices). They have also now introduced the SSM2017 which looks good on paper, but which I haven't tried yet. 
sci.electronics	 Here in switzerland, the situation is exactly the same. The cable tv companies even tried to stop amateur radio in switzerland in the beginning of cable tv(they seem to be too stupid to know anything about international frequency conferences or so). Even today, they use the cheapest possible coax running into problems they can't solve anymore. As Bill noted, the only way is to look for a solution with the neighbours *BEFORE* calling for the cable tv guys or the fcc. The chance to find neighbours with some sense for reason is by far bigger than with these people (especially the first ones). As anywhere in an administration people don't like, if You tell them to work for the money they get... The problem is, that radio amateurs don't have the power to put trough their rights in all cases. So let's hope they start soon with optical fibers and get out of our freqencies. 
sci.electronics	 I was wondering if anyone out there in net-land knew of a SIMPLE way to make a 4-band equalizer (single channel). I need it to accept LINE inputs (tape deck, CD player, etc.) and output to the same! So input impedance should equal output impedance. Also, since I am driving a line, I would need 1 volt p-p output. Final requirement is that I can either: 1. Control it digitally OR 2. Control it easily, or with few resistors 
sci.electronics	 and of course you older folks on the net will remember way back when Adcom got its RAVE reviews and kudos (ca 1985 or so) their 555 amp and preamp WERE not only designed here but built here in the USA. then they went to mexico and then to taiwan right after their sales skyrocketed because of their Stereopile review!!! if you have units that old look for MADE IN --- stickers on your unit. 
sci.electronics	 Dear Netters I want to send EMG-signals from a running person to a computer. Each signal is 4KHz wide and there is up to 30 of them on each running person. The signal is only to be sent over a few hundred meters. It seems to me that the frequency intended for this use is about 150MHz and about 440MHz. To make the transmitters as light as possible I suppose it will be best the to send the signals in an analog form. As this application is rather specialized I do not expect to be able to buy the exact transmitter- units i need. On the other hand I imagine that I can buy the receiver somewhere. I need a multichannel (up to 30 channels) receiver or 30 complete receivers in some rack system where one can add as many receivers as needed in the particular case. DO ANYBODY KNOW IF THERE IS EXISTING SUCH RECEIVER SYSTEM ON THE MARKET? 
sci.electronics	 Not recommended. Your circuit would take too much current, when telephone is on-hook. Telephone company does not like it. 
sci.electronics	 I own the Adcom 60W power amp. As far as I'm concerned, there's no amp which can touch it at the price range. The build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other amps in the price range. The whole amplifier is extremely solid with massive heat sinks and very solid casing. If you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well. Perfect symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each channel. The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good. 
sci.electronics	 I missed the first article[s] on this line due to not having a chance to read the news for a couple of days... 
sci.electronics	 I have an Adcom GFA-555 that I got in 1985. There certainly isn't anything magic about it. The components used are decent, but nothing uncommon with respect to consumer grade components. 
sci.electronics	 could | do the job. For example, say you want to map an acre lot, it'd be convenient | to place MW transmitters around the lot's periphery (either 2 or 3) and then | carry a hand-held recorder and walk to a point on the lot, press a button and | the coords of the recorder's location is stored as digital data. 
sci.electronics	 If the set is direct line powered, try checking the [likely to be there] hybrid regulator module down stream from the 170 volt supply. Several sets I've looked at use a 135 volt regulator. The regulators have a tendency to short out, making the safety circuits shut down the EHT supply section. 
sci.electronics	 Does anyone know what causes the ever-growing black border around the edges of my computer screen? The growth has been gradual so I don't know how long it's taken to get this bad. I have a 19" DEC (?) color monitor, maybe five years old, and the black border is about 1.1 inches on the left and right sides, about 1.75 inches on the bottom and negligible at the top of the screen. The only controls are brightness knob, contrast knob, deGauss switch, and power switch. 
sci.electronics	 1) Output offset: Obtain the service manual for the oscilloscope and adjust the internal output offset contorl. There is virtual certainty that there is an internal ajustment for the offset control's zero detent position. 
sci.electronics	 Hi, I am looking for some help in choosing a package for a high-speed silicon ADC (100Mhz) currently being fabricated. This is a PhD research project and I have to test the chip at speed on a PCB. I expect to have roughly 100 packaged circuits and will do DC, low-speed and high-speed testing using 3 different set-ups for the test chip. 
sci.electronics	 Just to complete that thought, the cooling towers cool water that circulates through heat exchangers that recondense the turbine exhaust back into feedwater for the heat exchangers that transfer energy from the reactor's cooling circuit. 
sci.electronics	 This is definitely the wrong newsgroup for this, but never mind. Any machine powered by heat (motor, steam- or gasturbine, steamengine, thermoelement,etc) work the better, the bigger the temperature difference between input and output is. Because You never get all thermic energy out of the powering medium (steam, burning gaz, etc), You have to eliminate the rest of the energy to keep the efficency high. A thermal electric power plant (coal, oil or atomic power) works just the same way. You heat water (steam) to power the turbine and generators. Because You don't get the whole energy out of the steam (efficency is never 100%) You have to cool down this steam again by something else. Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose (some type of mega-refrigerator...). Others use water of a river (ecologically not unobjectionable). Got it ? 
sci.electronics	 Back in the 70's I was a service technician for a cash register company. The cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they were VERY susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise. The biggest problems came from outlets that were not properly grounded. 
sci.electronics	 Help !! - I'm looking for a ISA driver card and driver software for a Logical Devices Husky programmer (It aint mush good without these) can anyone help with either of these items ? cheers Mike. 
sci.electronics	 One thing to consider is time division multiplexing the EMG channels to reduce the number of RF carriers you have to generate. If you multiplexed the EMG inputs at 10KHz, that would probably be sufficient for most physiology studies (you'd have ~ 330 Hz per channel sampling rate.) That level of analog multiplexing should be rather easy to accomplish. 
sci.electronics	 The Casio 7500 lectric diary has a 3-wire serial interface with param setting like RS232, for which one get a magic but expensive cable to connect to a PC. Does anyone know the spec of this interface, e.g., it needs inverting and boosting from CMOS signals to match RS232 lines? 
sci.electronics	 You still need to supply a proper ground for a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter! So rewiring is still a part of this job, however, the ground may be connected to a local earth ground, rather than back at the breaker box.

sci.electronics	 Radio Shack has canceled their "Battery of the Month" Club. Does anyone know why? 
sci.electronics	 During the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enough to melt. When this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the cooling tower where it is sprayed into the air. Contact with the cool outside air will condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor. There it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then reformed into pellets for reactor use the next day. 
sci.electronics	 Oddly enough, you don't, at least according to the wiring FAQ that is regularly posted on misc.consumers.house. 
sci.electronics	 There is a postscript manual at ic.berkeley.edu in pub/spice3/um.3f.ps directory (about 650kbytes, 126 pages).

sci.electronics	 My next project is to come up with an IF/detector module for fast -- 112 to 250 kB/sec -- packet radio use. No fancy modulation scheme, just wide FSK for use at 902 or 1296 MHz. 
sci.electronics	 I have a thermal fuse from a Apple Laserwriter II power supply (Made by Cannon) that I need to replace. The fuse is not the standard tubular thermal fuse like those found in hair driers etc, but is a rectangular plastic package, much like a transistor or diode. It is about 0.2"x0.2"x0.1", with both leads coming out of one of the 0.1"x0.1" sides. I have been told that it was made by MITI, a asian company, but I can find no information as to a supplier. This fuse is rated at 1A, 130C. Does anyone have a source for this fuse? I only need 5 or so, which means that the manufacturer wouldn't even want to talk to me, let alone, deal with me. 
sci.electronics	 No flames please, but I picked up this discussion a bit late and I am really curious... 
sci.electronics	 If anyone out there has an HP180 series scope or mainframe, I have the TDR plug in (the 1810, I believe) for it and have no need to keep it. Interested? E-mail me. 
sci.electronics	 The simplest one is easy. Take a lemon or other citrus type fruit, and stick a pair of metal strips into it for the contacts. The two strips must be of disimelar metals like copper and zinc. Then connect a voltmeter to the contacts and read the voltage. 
sci.electronics	 Hmm - I don't think you and I are thinking of the same thing. I was the original poster, BTW. The accelerator that I'm talking about almost certainly uses a 68HC000, according to the footnotes in the Supra ad. It only costs $199 list, so I really doubt if it has a 28 MHz 68030 inside. 
sci.electronics	 Not even in sub panels! The only place the neutral should be connected to the ground is in a SERVICE DISCONNECT! In your house the "main" panel serves as the service disconnect. Sub panles in your garage or workshop for example must maintain seperate neutral and ground busses because they are not service disconnect equipment. 
sci.electronics	 It's not the picture tube. More likely the flyback. Emerson? can't admire. Han 
sci.electronics	 Does this also affect the viewing of tapes ? I have had problems with a couple of rented tapes; they were virtually unviewable. I fiddled with the tuning, tracking and vertical hold but it was no good. 
sci.electronics	 Does anybody know if there is a mailing list or newsgroup for Power Systems and related areas? 
sci.electronics	 About a month ago there was a photo posted on alt.binaries.pictures.misc of a 17.5-inch Northern Pike which had been caught on a lure made of 256K SIMMs.

sci.electronics	 on the outside (not inner layers), expect, in 1 oz copper, at 15 amps, the following temperature rises versus width. This is from Sams' "Reference Data for Engineers," seventh edition, Pg 5-30, which claims in turn to be from MIL-STD-275C... 
sci.electronics	 This isn't exactly audio, but take a look in "RF Design" magazine, April 93, for the article "A Robust Signaling Technique for Part 15 RF Control Netowrk Applications." Page 29. Sources of parts are mentioned; in the same issue is an article that features a chipset for the Digital European Cordless Telecommunications standard. 
sci.electronics	 May I respectfully suggest you NOT do this?? The ground is supposed to be a protective ground, and though what you suggest looks good on paper, it's dangerous to rely on the same wire for power and protection. It'd never meet code, and if you now own the property and later sell it, you may end up with liabilities you don't want, and if you _don't_ now own it, well... 
sci.electronics	 What you describe is very close to what I built and described in the 10th ARRL Computer Network Conference proceedings. 
sci.electronics	 I have an HP 1815 TDR plug-in for an HP180 series scope or mainframe that I'm never going to use (no scope any more). If you're interested in it, please let me know. Price? Probably real cheap. 
sci.electronics	 I would be interested in hearing from anyone who knows of good software for antenna simulation, particularly in source form suitable for Unix workstations (though good PC software would also be of interest). I'm aware of the numerous mininec mutations, and have been using MN for some time now. I'm primarily interested in HF, VHF, and low UHF (< 500 MHz) designs, mostly wire antennas, but for thick wires and mesh surfaces as well as for your basic thin wire assumption. Is anything interesting happening with NEC itself? I've seen a version that was mutilated to run (sort of) under Microsoft Fortran, but I'm not sure how many "new and improved" versions of the code might be out there somewhere. I'd also be interested in non-NEC derivatives. The ones I've seen have been aimed at microwave applications, but if there is something out there useful at the lower frequencies, I'd like to know about it." 'Thanks, 
sci.electronics	 You didn't mention whether or not cost is an issue. Where exactly are you running 100MHz?? THe digital side? TTL? ECL? We run 200MHz and 100MHz all over our IC test equipment all day long in the ECL domain, and we use DIP's along with PLCC's, 25mil and 20mil pitch 256pin QFP's to name a few. I don't see a problem in packaging as long as you adhere to sound engineering practices. 
sci.electronics	 Good point...also, I wouldn't be surprised that the components they use off-shore are of inferior quality. As long as it was properly designed and robust, premium components are used, it shouldn't matter where it is assembled. 
sci.electronics	 Nonsense. First, the uranium fuel is sealed in zirconium alloy cylinders (which don't melt in any circumstances short of major failure of the power plant). Second, the primary water (that circulates inside the reactor core) is never pumped into the cooling tower (it's the SECONDARY water cycle that goes through the cooling tower). Third, liquid uranium would burst into flame on contact with air. 
sci.electronics	 Has anybody out there used/tested these new Fluke Scopemeters? How do they compare to a low-end Tectronix oscilloscope? Are there any big drawbacks about these handheld scopes when compared to the benchtop scopes of the same price range ($1000-$2000)? 
sci.electronics	 At 50 miles, a conventional set of TV antennas on a pole (one aimed at each transmitter location) should work well. 
sci.electronics	 I am interfacing some simple circuits that run on 9V to my cpu board which runs at 5-6V. The optoisolator is a 4N35. On the led side, I put the signal I want through a 10k resistor to the base of a 2N2222. On the transistor side, I tie my cpu input line to the collector which has a pull-up resistor of 47k. 
sci.electronics	 I've recently picked up some TIL311 display chips, but I can't find any information on them. It seems they are no longer made by TI, and I don't have an old enough data book. :-( 
sci.electronics	 Has anyone done a model of the 52 pin version of the 68hc11? It doesn't seem to be too big a job, but if someone else has already done it ... 
sci.electronics	 This probably only tells you that the DC blocking capacitor that's in series between the one-chip, single-ended audio amp and the speaker terminal is there. 
sci.electronics	 I keep finding these programmers in local junk shops. This may mean that they are indeed junk - but i'd like to hear from anyone else that may have met up with them. The basic device is a "Data I/O 29A universal programmer", and the usual pod is a "LogicPak 303A-Vo4" with a "303A-001" programming tester/ adapter. I'd really like to hear from anyone who knows whether these monsters are worth bothering with. All i want to do is blast PALCE22V10s. - Ideas, folks Mike.

sci.electronics	 I just installed a Motorola XC68882RC50 FPU in an Amiga A2630 board (25 MHz 68030 + 68882 with capability to clock the FPU separately). Previously a MC68882RC25 was installed and everything was working perfectly. Now the systems displays a yellow screen (indicating a exception) when it check for the presence/type of FPU. When I reinstall an MC68882RC25 the system works fine, but with the XC68882 even at 25 MHz it does not work. The designer of the board mentioned that putting a pullup resistor on data_strobe (470 Ohm) might help, but that didn't change anything. Does anybody have some suggestions what I could do? Does this look like a CPU-FPU communications problem or is the particular chip dead (it is a pull, not new)? Moreover, the place I bought it from is sending me an XC68882RC33. I thought that the 68882RC33 were labeled MC not XC (for not finalized mask design). Are there any MC68882RC33? 
sci.electronics	 Except for their size, the cooling towers on nuclear power plants are vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling towers designed and built in the 1890's (a hundred years ago) for coal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways.

sci.electronics	 Gee, I got the idea from somewhere that devices like this were in common use in WWII, so that commanders on board ships could bellow at the troops landing on a beach, for example. 
sci.electronics	 NASA and related agencies apparently used this same principles to create the loudest reported reproduced sound. They used an "analog" electrically controlled valve to control the flow of air across a horn throat. If I remember correctly it was called a "modulated air blast transducer". There were reports of the thing being able to produce 106 dB @ 80 Hz @ 10 mile distance, communicate directly with fighter pilots @ 5000 ft, etc. 
sci.electronics	 You are correct; the fastest "complete" image that could be presented on TV would be one field, which is 1/60 of a second (approximately). Of course, the phrase "TV screen" is often thrown around in reference to any CRT display, so perhaps this researcher wasn't using normal TV rates. Might even be a vector ("strokewriter") display, in which case the lower limit on image time is anyone's guess (and is probably phosphor-persistence limited).

sci.electronics	 A verrrrrry long time, like on the order of days. I had the pleasure of doing that once (playing with the speedo cable) and with my B&D heavy duty at full speed (600 rpm) all the speedo ever got up to was 30 MPH. Now if you go a high speed drill and ran it at say 4000 rpm, you could get 200 MPH out of it. (If you speedo doesn't burn out.) Anyways, to roll a 100000 Mile odometer would take 22 days or so. Much easier just to take the speedo apart. 
sci.electronics	 There has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding practices here. A few points need to be clarified: 
sci.electronics	 I used a bunch as weights, when building a model airplane. Hung them on the stringers, across the stringer, or whatever. Worked pretty well. 
sci.electronics	 I've also found that the electronic starters on these "instant-on" compact fluourescent lamp fixtures kick out interference that nukes my cordless phone. (I can hear it in my guitar amplifier, too...) 
sci.electronics	 This is a followup post to something I've written previously. Several people responded with good information, but I don't think I communicated exactly what I am looking for. I'm working on a custom I/O device that will communicate with a host via RS-232. My custom circuitry will use an 80C186EB or EC CPU and require about 64K of RAM (preferably FLASH RAM). In looking around, I see that lots of people have engineered UART-CPU-ROM-RAM subsystems that are ready to be interfaced to your custom I/O devices. It's been done so much, that it would be best if I can avoid reinventing a system. It just needs to use an 80C186 (or 188) CPU, and be able to load a program from the host then transfer control to that program. Well, there's one other thing the ROM needs to know how to do. It should have routines to send and receive bytes to/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (DTR,RTS,DTS,CTS). Everything I've seen is in the $200.00 and up range. That's too much for this application. I need something around $100.00. The CPU has the UART built-in, so you're only looking at a few chips. Does anyone know a company that markets a good board in this range, or some public domain circuitry I can use? Thanks in advance for the info.

sci.electronics	 Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual boiling-water reactor nuclear plants. (There's a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology). So it's more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as possible. Hence big cooling towers.

sci.electronics	 How hard would it be to somehow interface them to some of the popular Motorola microcontrollers. I am a novice at microcontrollers, but I am starting to get into them for some of my projects. I have several 256k SIMMs laying around from upgraded Macs and if I could use them as "free" memory in one or two of my projects that would be great. One project that comes to mind is a Caller ID device that would require quite a bit of RAM to store several hundered CID records etc... 
sci.electronics	 My monitor display has a bad case of the wigglies. I have a good ground. I live in an old house and I have replaced much of the wiring. I have two EMI filters on the computer, the monitor plugs into the computer. When fluorescent lights are on upstairs, the display jiggles, when motors run in the house, the display jiggles, when incandescent lights are on in the kitchen the display jiggles. I could bring a separate line from the breaker box, and use it only for the computer, would this do it? EMI doesn't only travel the 110 volt line though. Should I shield the back of the monitor? Ground a grid or plate? Your expertise is appreciated. Thanks very much! Ed Byrnes 
sci.electronics	 I have a spare Fluke 8062A. This is a true RMS digital meter with 4.5 digit display. It's in "average" condition (been used) but works fine - which is what Fluke's are all about. BTW - according to the fellow who designed these meters, they can be converted to 8060A function by clipping a jumper, and adding the 2 extra switches.. Like I said $115 seems fair - these sell for $300+ new. 
sci.electronics	 I would like to experiment with the INTEL 8051 family. Does anyone out there know of any good FTP sites that might have compiliers, assemblers, etc.? 
sci.electronics	 I have a Fujitsu M2322K which has been removed (I believe) from a digital X-Ray machine (takes X-Ray pictures without film). The Fujitsu part number is B03B-4745-B002A. 
sci.electronics	 I was told that this is an environmental based move. I was also told that there will be 'somthing' else to replace the battery club. Like maybe the 360K floppy club ;-). 
sci.electronics	 Not hard, you can do the refreshing and access cycles by software, but this hogs most of the available CPU cycles on a low-end controller. I've seen some application note from Philips that used one of their 8051 derivatives as a printer buffer, with up to 1MB of dynamic ram that was accessed and refreshed with software bit-banging. 
sci.electronics	 I'm not up on the details of US patent law, but I think this is incorrect. There is a "reasonable use" exemption for *copyright*. There is none for *patents*. The exemptions from patent licensing are quite narrow; R&D work is exempt but personal use is not. That is, it's okay to experiment with a patented idea, but not to put it to practical use (e.g. to improve your stereo), even if it's only your own private practical use. 
sci.electronics	 I am making a search for a CAD program that does a decent job of making schematic drawings. The program needs to be in MS-DOS, Windows if possible.

sci.electronics	 Assuming 68HC11... In expanded muxed mode, you *could* do it. Much easier if you get a DRAM controller IC. The MMI 673102 could be used to implement this, or you could use a counter and a huge multiplexer to provide row/column/refresh address multiplexing. The thing with DRAMs is that they require wierd timing, address multiplexing, and refresh. 
sci.electronics	 power plants are there to cool the used steam back into near ambient temperature water deleted 
sci.electronics	 Here's something I posted about this a few years ago. It's not fully up to date with all the new variations (some of which are just different manufacturer's synonyms): 
sci.electronics	 The actual hourglass is hollow and is designed to generate a draft, exploiting the venturi effect. Around the base of the hourglass is a ring of water towers. Warm river water, coming from the steam condenser in the plant, is sprayed over louvres. The draft being pulled through the tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection. The sensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for draft generation.

MF The most obvious way I've come up with is to use analog switches MF to adjust the gain of the op amp. The only analog switch I have MF experience with it the 4066. Unfortunately I want to switch an MF AC signal which goes from about -5V to 5V, and the 4066 is only MF for positive signals.

sci.electronics	 I recently bought an apparantly complete Expansion Chassis by Mountain Computer Inc. It consists of a box with 8 Apple ][+ compatible slots, powersupply brick, interface card and ribbon cable to attach it to the computer to be expanded. There was also included a small card with empty sockets on top and pins on the bottom that looks like it would plug into the ][+ motherboard somewhere after pulling a chip. There's an empty socket also on the interface card and a short 16-pin DIP jumper like the ones used with ][+ language cards. 
sci.electronics	 Does any one know if the 6551 is timing/pin compatible with the 6551.. It seems the 6551 has in iheirent bug with cts/rts handshaking and i need a suitable pin replacement to put in my serial card... possibly a buffered version perhaps? 
sci.electronics	 Where can I buy or build a device that will convert 20 ma current loop signals to RS232 voltages? I know some old terminals came with that option, but none of the ones I own have that. Anyway, I want to connect a computer to this old industrial computer to use the computer with communications software as a console instead of an old DecWriter. Please e-mail me if you have any info that would point me in the right direction. 
sci.electronics	 I think you posted your article 15 days too late :-)) April 1st is over. I don't like nuclear powerplants but i think it's not fair to tell such "storys" about them. OK ? Let me try to explain what that tower is used to: -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine. It has an hightech "boiler" but the rest is still verry verry conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation- powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too. If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find a chapter about the "CARNOT-process" which describes how to get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and "cold" steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy. And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of energy that carnot will give them. The cooling towers are for cooling the steam ! The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation, because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent radioactive pollution of the environment ! 
sci.electronics	 I need to reduce the speed of a Boxer fan by about 30-50%. I recall reading somewhere that the right capacitor in series will do it. 
sci.electronics	 On an A/D board I've got, I'm using the A/D lines. It measures the voltages properly, ie: with a 7v power supply it reg's 7v and with 5v, it reg's 5v. Problem is when I've got the input voltage, and I wish to lower it via a resistor. The sensitivity of the board is so great that I can triger it with holding the 5/7v wire in one hand, and touch the probe and it will register the full input voltage. A 1m resistor only lowers voltage by .1v so this is not too feesable. 
sci.electronics	 Well it looks as if Digi-Key sells a chip with the number ICL232 that does what you want. They are selling it for about $3.50... 
sci.electronics	 There usually is a way, however, often, telephone companies like to keep all of their internal numbers private. Depends on your exchange. Any modern electronic switching equipment usually have voice synth lines that echo the number you called from. The line service guys use this to make sure they connect up the right pairs of lines. 
sci.electronics	 We're looking at a series of chips by WSI, the PSD3xx series. They have _mega_ address decoding logic on them, various ROM sizes (upto 1Mbit), various RAM sizes (upto 16 K), and 19 I/O ports which can be chip select lines, I/O or the buffered address lines. 
sci.electronics	 to <All on 04-15-93 11:02 KG Yeah... keychains. I have seen 64K simms with a silver KG keyring attached, big seller at the computer store. I'm KG sure you could find a bunch of geeks^H^H^H^H^H^H computer KG science majors around that would buy them for $10. Maybe KG $15, if you're lucky. 
sci.electronics	 I understand that the new GPS boxes now have an option known as "differential ready". Apparently land-based beacons tranmit GPS correction information to your GPS receiver (with differential option installed). 
sci.electronics	 890 the phone company will read back the number to you. Try it. It might work. 
sci.electronics	 How about calling someone with the Caller ID service and have them call you back with the number? 
sci.electronics	 The switches have a non-negligable on resistance (up to 1k ohm when powered by 5 volts) and a maximum current and a Maximum Static Voltage Across Switch. Not a good bet for TTL. Should work for CMOS, but slow things down a bit. There are 74HC versions that have better specs. but lower max voltage. 
sci.electronics	 It's even older than that. I remember seeing a description of a garage operation selling them at some of the early Computer Faires in San Francisco about 5 years before that. 
sci.electronics	 Hi there, I have a mac 512 with a burned out part which looks like a voltage regulator.

sci.electronics	 The object of a cooling tower is to distribute dissolved salts in cooling water over large areas of farmland and to therefore decrease farm subsidies for non-producers by rendering their land infertile. 
sci.electronics	 Just as a not of possible interest on this subject .. It is my understanding that exploding televisions were a major cause of domestic accidents in the Soviet Union in past years! 
sci.electronics	 Not according to the NEC nor the CEC, as explained in the electrical wiring FAQ, which I posted here separately. Note the material under the headings 
sci.electronics	 I, too, have a XC68882RC50 math coprocessor, which I installed succesfully in my Mega Midget Racer (clocked at 33 MHz). I have tried clocking my FPU at 28 to 50 MHz and it all worked just fine. I have a MC68030-33 CPU. I don't know why my FPU has an XC (my original 33MHz FPU was label MC68882-33), but it seems to work fine on my system. Maybe you just have a bad chip. 
sci.electronics	 Actually the reasons you don't see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are 1) fossil units (multiple units per plant) are generally smaller than nuclear plants. 300 MWe seemed to be a very popular size when many fossil plants were built. The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe. 2) many fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were adopted ("why those old dirt burners can't harm anything, let 'em go."). 3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally not visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants. 4) fossil plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears. 
sci.electronics	 Are you (two) joking? Is the entire Internet flaming you (two)? Ahh!, now I remember that Ohmite company was the first introducing "the pink colored resistor", only for electronics working females ;-) 
sci.electronics	 Definately, I agree wholeheartedly. If they can build the amp where the labour is not so expensive, they can afford to put decent components in and go to more effort to improve the design of the amplifier - as Adcom has done. 
sci.electronics	 Digi-Key also sells Quad Line Receivers, parts DS1489AN (68cents) and DS1489N (48cents). A Quad Line Driver, part DS1488 (48cents), is also sold. I guess if you don't won't to supply +12V, the chips with the pump-up circuitry might be worth the extra cost. But 1488's and 1489's are available at your friendly neighborhood RS, parts MC1488 (276-2520) for $1.29 and MC1489 (276-2521) for $1.29. 
sci.electronics	 Have you changed the crystal that clocks for the FPU. If you haven't then it won't work. 
sci.electronics	 GEC/Plessey specify a series of FM demodulators (SL1454 etc) for use in satellite TV receivers : 150 or 600MHz in, 10MHz of baseband video out. I think there's also a related data slicer / clock recovery circuit intended for use in DMAC decoders, though that isn't used in the most common implementation - it may not be in volume production. 
sci.electronics	 We used to buy Beckman 110 and HD110 ("ruggedized") versions for use by electricians in the steel mill where I work. After a while we got round to filling all the current-input jacks with silicone - electricians have a regrettable habit of not checking where the last guy left the leads before using a 3 1/2 digit 0.5 % autoranging $400 meter to check if a fuse is good or not. Its very hard on meters (and electricians) when you put the milliamp shunt across a 600 volt bus.' "But that's not why we stopped buying Beckmans - after a while a lot of them got "funny" in the LCD display. A black stain would spread from one edge, or else they'd come adrift from those Zebra connectors and fail to operate. Now we buy Flukes, the low-end 20 series mostly ( and we still fill the amp jack with silicone). What the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges or turn it on/off with a lead stuck in the amps jack - a little bit of clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world safer for electricans, anyway. Not that I've ever put a meter on the wrong range into a live circuit, no, not me...not more than a dozen times, anyway.... Bill

sci.electronics	 I've been thinking of sending into Mad magazine an idea for a parody, of those books entitled "How Things Work" that engineers buy their sons, which explain how engines, elevators, flourescent lights, etc. work. 
sci.electronics	 This was the Pathe you are thinking of, although there were other imitators. It didn't wear the disks any more than conventional acoustic designs, but it did have a high noise level due to the continual hiss of escaping air. There are a lot of them still operating, and they are pretty ingenious.

sci.electronics	 Here's a rough sketch of how the system works. A reference station with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the incoming GPS signals. These errors are due to several factors including atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time dithering, etc. The reference unit contains complex computational equipment to "back out" the errors in its position (since it knows where it is already). It then transmits these corrections on a broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local receivers. If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using the same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit. Thus, the receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference unit. 
sci.electronics	 I'm looking for brief information on new applications of electronics (or new electronics in applications.) If you know of any interesting new stuff, I would be intrested in hearing about it. 
sci.electronics	 Some weeks ago, someone posted an article telling when and where a hamfest and computerfest was going to be help in Dayton, OH. Unfortunately, I lost the article and I was wondering if someone could repost it. 
sci.electronics	 Someone was looking for these a few weeks ago - check out comp.dsp Mike. 
sci.electronics	 Aaahh... a problem very near and dear to my heart. In our case, other monitors cause this problem - the deflection coil of other monitors to be specific. Have also seen a monitor backed up to a fuse panel exhibit this problem. This sounds like your problem since flourescent lites, motors, etc several 10s of feet away seem to me to be too far to cause it, but the juice running to them must pass nearby your monitor. Fusebox on other side of wall maybe? We started spec'ing Panasonic CT-1331Y video monitors (3 switchable input lines(vid & aud) S-VHS on one) <$400. This stopped the wavy interference effect on the computer monitor next to it. Now on to your problem. You need what is known as mu shielding (very common, in fact almost mandatory on electrostatic deflection type O'scopes). I talked to a EE prof. He said get a coffee can, cut both ends off, mount around deflection coil of interfering monitor. BE CAREFUL TO AVOID ALL HIGH VOLTAGE CIRCUITRY. ESPECIALLY THE THICKER HIGH VOLTAGE ANODE LEAD USUALLY COLORED RED. IF YOU KILL YOURSELF, DON'T BLAME/SUE ME!!! USE PLASTIC OR OTHER NON-CONDUCTING STAND-OFFS AND SUCH TO MOUNT CAN. Now, I would assume that what is good for keeping mag fields in is also good at keeping them out, so hopefully this'll work by mounting shield on monitor being interfered with as well. If not, start shielding those other sources. 
sci.electronics	 Does anybody out there have one of those food dehydrators I've been seeing all over late-night TV recently? I was wondering if they use forced air, heat, or both. If there's heat involved, anybody know what temperature they run at? My wife would like one and I'm not inclined to pay $100.00 for a box, a fan and a heater. Seems to me you should be able to throw a dehydrator together for just a few bucks. Heck, the technology is only what? 1,000 years old? 
sci.electronics	 Well, this is my second try at posting on this subject. Here goes... In Texas (Corpus Christi at least) if you pick up the phone and dial 890 the phone company will read the number of the phone you are on back to you. I believe the service department uses this to make certain they are repairing the correct lines when they open the BIG junction boxes. I don't know if it will work but you can give it a try. Good luck. 
sci.electronics	 I built a little project using the radio shack 5vdc relays to switch audio. I got pretty bad 'clicks' when the thing switched. I was doing most of the common things one is supposed to do when using relays and nothing seemed to get rid of the clicks. 
sci.electronics	 Does anyone know what frequencies the wireless transmitter/receiver microphone systems that Radio Shack sells operate at? I've tried everything short of opening one up (not actually owning one makes this difficult...) and just looking.. Any help would be greatly appreciated.. These systems are designed for wireless PA systems, etc.. 
sci.electronics	 It appears as if the problem is related to the 68882/50's need for very fast (and clean) signal transitions. I got some email (Vielen Dank, Thomas) stating that Motorola provides a solution for this problem in their 68030 manual. Since my manual (1989) predates the 50 MHz 68030/68882s I couldn't find it. Could someone please email me the specifics? Thanks Christian 
sci.electronics	 I remember watching a whole "Mr. Wizzard" program on this subject when I was a kid.

The electrolyte was sauerkraut!

sci.electronics	 The rule for the designations is that if it says MC, that means it works *exactly* the way the datasheet/book specifies. If it says XC, that means there is at least one known bug. Often these bugs are small and obscure; you might never run into them in practice. 
sci.electronics	 Since your MOSFET is a 1972 vintage, it's probably not a very good one by today's standards. If you have an idea about its voltage and current ratings, e.g. 60VDC @ 6A, you can probably get away with replacing it with anything with better specs. Early MOSFETS had a gate-source voltage rating of approximately +/- 20 VDCmax, and they would usually turn completely "ON" at +10VDC. Otherwise, MOSFETS are not really mysterious -- they're more or less voltage controlled current sources. If the MOSFET in your circuit is used as an open-loop, voltage controlled current source, you may have to experiment with various gain-altering techniques. 
sci.electronics	 I have never worked with really small signals before and have a few questions about low level noise. I have noticed that the waveform synthesizer that I am using (Analogic 2020) has some relatively large common mode noise on it. I am using this synthesizer to 'null' out another transient waveform and am amplifying the difference (~200uV) several hundred times. The 2020 has about 1-3 mVp-p of common mode noise and this tends to make my measurements hard to repeat. (The noise is not quite in sync with line frequency, and on a spectrum analyzer, the main component is about 64Hz).

sci.electronics	 There is a number you can call which will return a synthesized voice telling you the number of the line. Unfortunately, for the life of me I can't remember what it is.

sci.electronics	 I am in the midst of designing a project which requires two motors and an LED illuminator driven with Pulse-width modulation. I'm using the 8751, and I understand that the -FB version has a programmable counter array that can essentially be set and forgotten to do the PWM. The problems is, that variant is difficult to come by. I need two or three of the D prefix (ceramic window) version for development, and then lots of the P prefix (plastic OTP) for later production. I've tried Avnet, Arrow, and Pioneer. They (might) have them, but I'm looking for samples at this point, and they're not too willing to provide them. I would buy them, but these vendors have $100.00 minimums.

sci.electronics	 was : wondering if anyone could provide me with some information as to how to : construct a home-built battery. In my grade school days, I remember 
sci.electronics	 I repair a lot of monitors here, and I'd like to know where I can get a pattern generator (or a circuit for one) that will provide MDA, EGA and VGA signals. Using a whole PC to do this takes up too much space on my bench, and is somewhat less than portable. I guess I could sit down and design something, but I don't have the time right now - any (reasonable) suggestions would be appreciated. 
sci.electronics	 Can anyone please email a diagram or give me details of an ftp site where there is a diagram of a simple, small fm mono voice transmitter for trasnmitting in the 90-104 range (preferably above 100 Mhz). Only a short distance requiered, and frequency variation no too important but must run from 9v or smaller DC supply. 
sci.electronics	 Are you switching high level signals or low level signals like pre-amp out level signals? Also, are the clicks you mentioning the big clack that happens when it switches or are you refering to contact bounce? How are you driving the relays? TTL gate output? Switching transistor? How are the relays connected to what you are driving? 
sci.electronics	 I need the specs on various eprom data formats such as Intel Hex, Motorola S JEDEC etc. 
sci.electronics	 Does anyone know if a source for the TCM3105 modem chips (as used in the Baycom and my PMP modems)? Ideally, something that is geared toward hobbyists: small quantity, mail order, etc. 
sci.electronics	 The Federal Communications Act of 1934 made it *legal* for you to operate a radio receiver of any kind, on any frequency (including X, K, and Ka bands) in the United States. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1989(?) restricted the FCA of 1934 by making it illegal to receive the land-mobile telephone service, including (I believe) cellular phones. No restriction was placed on receiving RADAR (or, curiously, cordless phones.) Enforcement of the Virginia law is in violation of the FCA of 1934. If you have lots of time and money (and a lawyer, which I'm *not*,) you can argue this in a federal court and try to have the law overturned. 
sci.electronics	 Yes, I know it sounds crazy. Call it an urge. Call it what you want. Just don't ask why :-) 
sci.electronics	 Illegal to receive land-mobile telephone service? Don't you have to have a mobile reciever to even have land-mobile telephone service? What about ship-to-shore telephone service? 
sci.electronics	 I've got the same problem; I can't dig up any info on the jumper settings on the hd 3.5" drives. 
sci.electronics	 XC units are often pre-production sample devices. Those are normally distributed for evaluation as freebies and are not guaranteed to meet every spec. 
sci.electronics	 Just a thought........Maybe it possibly has to do with the fact that it IS an Emerson. I've got an Emerson VCR which is #6 in the series. Returned it six times for various and never the same problems. Got tired of taking it back and fixed it myself. The Hi-Fi "window" was a bit off. Something like the Hi-Fi audio fine-tuning. When I was a Wal-Mart "associate" in '88-'89, we had AT LEAST one returned as defective EVERY SINGLE DAY. How's that for reliability? Face it--Emerson can make audio stuff (albeit not of premium quality), but they CAN'T make anything as complex as video equipment with reliability IMHO. Please, no flames. Just *had* to share my Emerson disaster in the light of this exploding tv. JC

sci.electronics	 Those rules/regulations/laws would be subject to the same attack: that they are attempting to preempt federal authority to regulate (or not) radio communications. Of course, as the original poster noted, court challenges of this kind can get expensive. 
sci.electronics	 Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts. It is very unlikely, however, that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car. Ham rigs for cars put out around 100 watts. It is possible that a 100 watt radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet away. Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding. If you experience the problem frequently, it may be caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station nearby. The interference may have been caused by a radio transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire, etc. If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter. 
sci.electronics	 I was looking at the amps diagram for Sony 1090/2090 receivers, and I was amazed to find a difference between the US and Canadian model on the capacitor(s) that hangs off the output to the speakers: 
sci.electronics	 Hello net. I have a 386sx motherboard with the Phoenix BIOS, an on-board IDE controller port, and two on-board serial ports. Unfortunately, I don't have a manual for this beast and I would like to be able to disable the IDE controller in order to use the MFM controller I have. The board says it is made in Korea and it uses the Chips Chipset. If anyone can give me a clue as to how to go about configuring the board so as not to use the IDE controller, or how to go about finding out how to do it, their help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your assistance. Please mail buhrow@nfbcal.org with your responses as my news feed is rather tenuous. Thank you very much! -Brian <buhrow@nfbcal.org 
sci.electronics	 I am having trouble obtaining the specified standby current drain from a MC146818A Real Time Clock. Has anyone out there had some experience in doing this? The specs call for a few sequences to be met before standby mode is activated, and are a bit hard to decipher on that, but I thought that I had it worked out. However, with a 32kHz crystal the lowest current drain I can acheive at 3.7V Vcc is 150uA. This is three times the specified MAXIMUM under the conditions I am attempting to create. 
sci.electronics	 Could someone please tell me if a 1/4 decoder is the same as a 1 to 4 demultiplexer. I know how to link 2 of these to get an 8 output circuit, but how do I link 5 of these to make a 1/16 multiplexer. Sorry if this seems like a lame question, but I'm only a newbie to electronics, and I have to do this circuit. Please make any mail as droolproof as possible. 
sci.electronics	 The Fluke 87 beeps at you if you try to take it out of a current measuring range while there is still a lead plugged in to the current sense socket. 
sci.electronics	 The Fujitsu 2322 uses what is known as an 'SMD' interface (Storage Module Device?). A lot of older minis used it. Sun still does on their server models. There are several different speeds of SMD, and I think that the Fuji drive you have is rated at about 24 Mb/sec (thats megabits). There used to be several companies that made couplers for the PC (Interphase in Texas being one), but I think that the market pretty much has dried up. Controllers for this type of drive are readily available for VME buses though. Rumor has it that there is a SMD to SCSI adapter available, but I think that it was designed for slower SMD devices. In other words, if you have a PC or Mac, that drive is pretty much dogmeat. Cheers, Corwin

sci.electronics	 Since I have seen various different numbers to dial to get your number read back to you by the phone company, could someonepost a list or point me to a book where I could get a list of all the different numbers for the U.S.? Failing that, could someone tell me Ohio's? 
sci.electronics	 Do you get a dial tone when you plug a phone into the jack?? If not, then the line is possibly disconnected from the nearest telco junction box. If you do get a dial tone, then surely the telco is sending a bill for the line to *someplace* or *somebody*. Are you sure that what you are doing is on the level. Sounds to me like you are just trying to get at somebody's unlisted number. Fess up. 
sci.electronics	 Check out Xicor's new goodie in the April 12th edition of EETimes X88C64 - an 8k * 8 E2PROM with built in latch AND bootloader setup. You hook it directly to your '51, power it up, the prom initialises the serial port on the '51, you load in your code via RXD, this gets blatted onto the E2PROM, then you reset and run - i'm sure Dallas also does something like this too, i suppose it would boil down to relative prices, and the Dallas part freeing up P0 & P2 completely. I wonder if ANYONE has ever managed to design a single sided PCB with an 8051, 573, EPROM, SRAM and NO LINKS<< ? cheers Mike. 
sci.electronics	 I have also been trying to complete my collection. I have an extra CCI # 16 (Communications) and a # 12 (Applications in the Arts), both in mint condition. 
sci.electronics	 Any info on modern 20MHZ or better dual trace scopes would be appreciated. Should I buy a used one or a new one? And where? 
sci.electronics	 The only explanation I can think of is that two capacitors in series can handle twice the output voltage. Sometimes two elco's in antiseries (you know, positive sides facing eachother) are used to obtain a large capacitor that can handle positive and negative voltages as well.

sci.electronics	 Yes, I have taken a bit of flame on this one. I must've been half asleep when I posted a response to Joseph. 
sci.electronics	 While driving through the middle of nowhere, I picked up KNBR, AM 1070, a clear-channel station based in Los Angeles. They had an ad claiming that they were able to get traffic flow information from all of the thousands of traffic sensors that CalTrans has placed under the pavement. Does CalTrans sell this info? Does KNBR have an exclusive? What's the deal? 
sci.electronics	 As a general rule, no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer the circuit with the contacts. The noise you hear is due to the momentary opening and closing of the path. 
sci.electronics	 Gremilins have attacked my keyboard and the correction to my followup on audio relays got fouled up. Varying lamp resistance, should read, "Varying lamp voltage" 
sci.electronics	 You can get a *little* UV by putting a heavy UV filter (deep purple) in front of an ordinary flashlight bulb (the brightest you can get). My father used a setup like this in law enforcement work circa 1964. 
sci.electronics	 I had a similar idea, for a fax/answering machine switch, to put both machines on one line. You order distinctive ringing from your phone company. This is $3/month here. You get a second (unpublished) phone number. When someone calls this number, your phone rings with short rings instead of long rings.

Also, are the ROM chips that were used fo rthe 2600 games still available , or were they propreitary? Please email me with any responces, as this is very important.. Thanks a million... 
sci.electronics	 I've had my Fluke 8060A here at work for just over 10 years now. It is a wonderful meter. Several colleagues here have some of the newer Fluke meters, though I still would just as soon hang on to my 8060. The 8060 a is the 1980s digial "analog" to the Simpson 260 analog DMM of the 1950-1960s. There was/is (?) an 8060B that had extended frequency response. 
sci.electronics	 Yes, you increase the RPM slip of a "boxer" type fan by installing a capacitor in series with the fan's power supply. The air flow of small 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4 uF capacitor. Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working voltage rating around 250 volts. Note that some impriical study is usually required to experimentally determine the best size capacitor for a given application. 
sci.electronics	 Awhile back someone posted some information on where you can get kits to build an EEG. Does anyone remember where you could get this. I'm very interested in getting some info on this. Thanks in advance. 
sci.electronics	 It is illegal to use anything you eavedropped on for a business or for an illegal use. Jurisdictions that ban radar detectors or police monitors, are essentially making the claim that there is no other reason for a radar detector or police radio monitor. 
sci.electronics	 I am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video (Vs. a blank screen) by monitoring the R,G, and B outputs of a graphics card. It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at 65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse. It should also be able to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv) and a dim screen (say, around 310 mv). Oh yes, it also needs to be cheap. 
sci.electronics	 I would like to be able to detect the angular position (low accuracy) of an IR emitting source at a distance of about 100 meters (more is better) in daylight. The IR source could be emitting a signature; I'm leaning toward 30 KHz square wave with 50% duty cycle. 
sci.electronics	 Hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp, and are also unlikely to have a "dirty" amp. 
sci.electronics	 Well, I'm not too sure if this would be the right place to post this, but anyway, here goes: I was just noticing that some of the current bubblejet printers offers up to 360x360 resolution while a lot of lower end laser printers only offer 300x300. However, the laser printers still seems to be significantly pricier than the bubblejets... how is this? Or am I missing something about the resolution thing? 
sci.electronics	 Mixers have a wide variety of implementations; the Mini-Circuits part you mention is a doubly-balanced diode mixer, but active ones (BJT, FET) seem more popular in consumer receivers. You might call MCL; they have a nice catalog. 
sci.electronics	 I want to be able to take a bunch of home-made songs (from DAT or other suitable master) and output them to a short run (10-20 off) of standard music CDs. Would one of the CD recorders designed for writeable CD ROMs work for this purpose? Alternatively, is there a service that does this sort of thing for a fee? 
sci.electronics	 I was wondering, what copy protection techniques are avaliable, and how effective are they? Has anyone have any experience in this area? 
sci.electronics	 It is too possible. As the original poster said "it is very unlikely" but definately possible. (Can you say batteries?) 
sci.electronics	 After I have produced a schematic with PADS-LOGIC, how do I import it into PADS-PCB to create a PCB pattern? The only way I've gotten it to work is to output a FutureNet netlist, and then import this into PADS-PCB. Is there another way of doing this? I didn't see any information in the instructions provided, but I might have missed something. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! 
sci.electronics	 Bubblejets often splatter a little bit, whereas LaserJets (given half-way decent toner, like HP's "Microfine" stuff) don't. Both produce very good output, but you don't have to look too closely at the two to tell that LaserJet output is definitely superior. 
sci.electronics	 hello there, I would like to know if any one had any experience with having on-board decoupling capacitors (inside a cmos chip) for the power lines. Say I have a lot of space left im my pad limited design. any data on the effect of oxide breakdown? any info or pointers are appreciated.

sci.electronics	 A method which will directly (almost) provide you with the information that you require is that which is commonly used for coordinate measurements of human body landmarks (eg. the SELSPOT system by SELSPOT AB, Sweden, and the WATSMART System ??). These use lateral photoeffect detectors [Lindholm and Oberg, 1974; Woltring and Marsolais, 1980] to determine the position of a spot of light projected (using a camera lens) over its surface. In escence, the detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes (one on each of the four sides of the square detector crystal) and a single anode (the back of the crystal). A spot of light will produce currents which are proportional to the position of the spot on the detector's face. Let's try some ASCII graphics in 2-D (so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position)

sci.electronics	 According to my TI databook, the pinouts for the TIL311 display are as follows: 
sci.electronics	 Uh oh... Umm, there are a number of copy protection schemes. Some involve modifying the physical media, and some involve encryption schemes, &c. All of the ones that have existed over the course of computing have been successful for a time. I recall, however, near monthly releases of new ways to "crack" the copy protection scheme of the latest releases. The fact is, none of them are completely secure, or anywhere near it. Some are more or less difficult to crack, and some have already been cracked. I guess what I am saying is that your question is difficult, if not impossible, to answer. What exactly do you want to know? Do you need a good one for a project you are working on? How secure must it be? Are you trying to crack one that someone else has used? I can probably make suggestions, assuming the activity is strictly legal. (In general, it is a BAD idea, legally, to tamper with copy protection. It can also lead to corruption of files which you necessarily do not have back ups of (being as they are copy protected,) which can be devestating.) Do you have absolutely no ideas for practical applications, and are merely curious? Please clear up those questions, and I'll try to help as much as I can. 
sci.electronics	 he ones I have seen are all fluorescent tubes. Maybe you could find a small tube to go in one of those hand-held fluoro lanterns? 
sci.electronics	 Now, that indeed is possible. A good friend of mine is running about 1 KW PeP from his car. Yes, he does have a second alternator. Yes, he calls the rig an "electronic brake" since the engine noticeably slows when the key is down. 
sci.electronics	 One of the easiest, and really very used ways of copyprotection, is to mark a specific sector on the installation disk bad. This is very easy to get around, though, if you have any knowledge of hw-hacking, but most 'normal' users (yes those lowly key-punchers) don't. Whatever you do, please do _not_ use a hardware key. These were very popular a few years ago, and they STINK!! 
sci.electronics	 I don't want to get into a semantic argument, but contrary to some other postings "near UV light" /is/ "actual UV light." The "near" means that it is close to the visible spectrum (i.e. of relatively long wavelength), not that it is "nearly UV." (I'm sure you can figure out now just what "far UV" is.) 
sci.electronics	 There was a news article a little while ago reporting a type of car (was it a Volvo?) was found to stall if you used a certain brand/model of cellular phone in it. I seem to remember the car was recalled to fix the problem. 
sci.electronics	 A 1 of 4 decoder need not be the same as a 1 to 4 demultiplexer, although many commercial SSI implementations allow you to use one as such. Strictly, a 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change state, according to the inputs. 
sci.electronics	 Since I'm not all too keen on this area of hooking them up, I'm asking for help. I know better than to hook a 12v, 1a stepper line to one, unless it can take it; however what about if I've got a 24-60v stepper. What sort of curent limmiting circuitry would be involved (a small schematic would probably be helpfull). Also, I've looked into the TIPC2701N by TI, and I was wondering if I should use the same suggested (by you replying to this message) current limiting circuitry on each of the 7 mosfets in the package as that illustrated in the schematic (which you the replyer would hopefully help me with). 
sci.electronics	 Yes, but... the minimization of gates is important in part because of TIMING considerations. A TTL gate has the basic structure of AND/OR/INVERT, and an inversion of a sum of a product is just exactly ONE gate delay. The reason to find a minimal sum of products is that this matches a hardware optimization. 
sci.electronics	 where can I buy 1 or 2 of these chips (pref in Australia)? What is name and address of `UMC'? 
sci.electronics	 Unless the DVM *says* it's measuring RMS, it's probably Average voltage. The input is diode rectified and measured as DC. If it says it's RMS and but measures square/triangle/etc. incorrectly, it's measuring average and multipling by a correction that's *only* true for sine waves (i.e. Vave*(0.707/0.63) = Vrms). If you want correct RMS for (most) any waveform, you need a "True-RMS" DVM/DMM which literally does the Root-Mean-Square calculation in either analog or digital circuitry. 
sci.electronics	 Hi there, Can anyone tell me where it is possible to purchase controls found on most arcade style games. Many projects I am working on would be greatly augmented if I could implement them. Thanx in advance. 
sci.electronics	 Look at the 4053. This is a triple 2-to-1 transmission-gate analog multiplexer, with positive and negative power supplies (can be run from a single-ended supply as well). With dual supplies, the logic inputs still range from ground (0 Volts) to VDD. 
sci.electronics	 I have written a program and I want to market it. I would like certain degree of protection, since my main custmers are individuals and not the cooperations. I know laser hole burning method, and hardware key method, however, my software is going to cost only $15.00, so I can not afford that. Also, at this low price I can not afford people make too many copy of my software. Well, I guess say upto %20 illigal copying is ok by me. 
sci.electronics	 Right. So all the cops will be buying antique muscle cars for chase cars; otherwise the *police* cars will die too! 
sci.electronics	 Check out a medical supply catalog, the thing you are looking for is called a woods lamp (so you can check for woods sign, certain skin conditions flourecse (sp) under UV light) They come in disposable penlight like types and larger ac powered types. It is also used in eye examinations, a flourescent dye is introduced to the surface of the eye, then UV is shined on it, shows up scratches and abrasions very clearly that would otherwise be very difficult to detect. (for the completest the dye is called flouescien, and in normal light appears orangish, and leaves a mild burning sensation to the eye for 10-15 minutes, until the tears flush it all out.

sci.electronics	 DEC did this on their new alpha chip. I'm sure you could call them up and ask them how they did it (haha).

The 2600 had some extra ASIC chips that were basically modified graphics chips and PIA's for the joysticks.

sci.electronics	 You were right the second time, it is KNX. Believe it or not, I also listen to KNX in the evenings here in Colorado! It's kind of fun driving through the country listening to traffic jams on the 405. Back to your original question. Yes, there are sensors just past every on-ramp and off-ramp on the freeways. They're the same sensors used at most stoplights now (coils in the pavement). You might want to give CalTrans a call or even ask Bill Keene (KNX's traffic reporter). I doubt if just anyone can get the information, but it would be worth asking just in case you can get it.

I am not sure of the impact but I would imagine that enforcement of the law by visually sighting a radar detector became difficult - if not impossible! 
sci.electronics	 Write a good manual to go with the software. The hassle of photocopying the manual is offset by simplicity of purchasing the package for only $15. Also, consider offering an inexpensive but attractive perc for registered users. For instance, a coffee mug. You could produce and mail the incentive for a couple of dollars, so consider pricing the product at $17.95. 
sci.electronics	 Many thanks to those who replied to my appeal for info on a drive I have which is 3.5" 600RPM!! 
sci.electronics	 Why don't you just run one LED at 60 KHz and use a flip flop at the receiving end to divide by 2 and give you a good square 30KHz signal. Just a thought. LORI 
sci.electronics	 I am involved with a Michigan company that has an application requiring wireless data transfer. If you have expertise or information that may assist us in this project, please contact me (INTERNET: leblanc@cvm.msu. edu). 
sci.electronics	 Well, they claim they are the only radio broadcaster with this information. But the city's cable channel (35 in CableVision areas) shows this information map during travel times (6-9am and 4-7pm, I believe). Most of the major LA freeways are covered. The computer-generated map shows green, yellow, red, or flashing red (respectively: <40mph, 25-40mph, 25mph, and "incident"--I might be off a little on the speeds, since this is from memory). 
sci.electronics	 I need a small battery powered hi voltage capacitive discharge supply to deliver ~6 joules at 250 volts. This implies a 200uf cap. I have built a very satisfactorily operating version from a MAX641, but do not like the idea of using a $6 single source part. It seems that the ubiquitous camera flash circuit is what I want, but I cant get mine apart without breaking it. I would appreciate receiving the circuit description or a source of one. I have already looked in several electronics circuits handbooks to no avail. Thanx 
sci.electronics	 HAP controls just outside Chicago sells these. I don't remember which suburb they are in. The prices are pretty reasonable and they are easy to hook up. I bought a new coin mechanism from them for $25.00 a couple of years ago. 
sci.electronics	 With relays alone, you will always get a transient when you abruptly turn ON or OFF any channel. If you don't want to hear the transient, use some other device (a photoresistor-output optoisolator is the usual sort of thing) to gently MUTE the signal, then switch, THEN remove the power from the lamp in the optoisolator. 
sci.electronics	 And the Commonwealth of Virginia has not exactly butted against the issue on those grounds. The claim is that AS A MATTER OF TRAFFIC SAFETY one is not allowed to have a functioning radar detector on the dashboard while operating a motor vehicle. 
sci.electronics	 I've even seen pictures of an installation where the ham pulled a little trailer behind his car with a 4KW generator, and ran the full legal limit while mobile. I don't know what his gas mileage was like, though, or where he found resonators able to stand the gaff. 
sci.electronics	 The point is that the original poster was talking about connecting ground and neutral in the *outlet* box (big NO NO), and you are talking about them being connected in the breaker box (as things should be). 
sci.electronics	 I use an H11F1 FET optoisolater to switch microphone level signals. There is no click, since I put a .1uF cap across the LED. Distortion measurement are very low with mic level, and they went up to 0.03% at a + 14 dB line level. All I did was put the FET in series with one leg of the balanced line. No hums, pops, just audio jumping out of silence. The FET runs about 100 million ohms with the LED dark and drops to 150-200 ohms with it on. 
sci.electronics	 Hey, now will you stop encouraging him? Copy protection only serves one pur- pose: to keep the honest buyer from making (legal) backup copies. It will definitely not stop any pirates. If you want to protect you soft, supply a good documentation and support. This is IMHO the *only* way of effectively pro- tecting software.

sci.electronics	 We are Dartmouth engineering students.We are looking for documented data regarding the wear associated with turning on an off a monitor and how it relates to power consumption. Interested in a comparison between the wear on a monitor which is left on continuously and one which is turned off when not in use. 
sci.electronics	 Or, _documentation_ for the program ;-). A lot of shareware out there is very similar in the approach - send in your money, and you get documentation, and a free upgrade to the latest version. Perhaps even support of some small degree. Whatever you want to offer that is "better" than the circulating version. 
sci.electronics	 Well, I've now been working on this DAMNED stepper controller board since 9pm. It's now 6am... I'm pissed off. Period. Alright, I can drive the steppers through the 3479P's; no problem (that's with the 6-wire steppers, 2 to +, and the other 4 are the phase lines). Problem 1: I've got some 4 wire steppers. I put the darkest line to + and the other 3 to the 3479P... worked, kinda. Tried it with a printer stepper (moves the head back and forth, 4 wires), didn't work too well. It would shift back and forth (use something like a 4017 instead?) Also I've been trying to get a bunch of NPN's to work with it... NO LUCK... tried PNP's, still NO LUCK!!! I don't know if I'm cursed on this or what, but I feel my brain slowly frying with the thought of STEPPER ... ARGGG!!! I don't know what's wrong with the transistor hook-up (to-220" 'pkg type), also tryed the 2n2222-pkg type... no luck.

sci.electronics	 I had the good luck to obtain an EICO dynamic conductance tube tester for a song. Unfortunately, I was a little out of key; the only thing wrong with it was an open meter movement. Does anyone know where I can find either another meter movement like it, a dead-but-not-the-meter-dead unit, or schematics to specify the current scale of the meter movement? I can cut and paste a more sensitive movement in if I can find what the full scale current was. Or... is EICO still contactable?

sci.electronics	 This may be a safety issue; the CSA is more paranoid in certain areas than UL and such. Two caps in series means that you don't have a short if one of them shorts. 
sci.electronics	 I was just wondering one thing, actually two. ( I hope that this is the proper place to post this subject) 
sci.electronics	 I'd like to see this info as well. As for wavelength, I think you're primarily going to find two - 880 nM +/- a bit, and/or 950 nM +/- a bit. Usually it is about 10 nM either way. The two most common I have seen were 880 and 950 but I have also heard of 890 and 940. I'm not sure that the 10 nM one way or another will make a great deal of difference. 
sci.electronics	 This is message is only of interest to those going to International Symposium on Circuits and Systems that is being held in Chicago this May. 
sci.electronics	 Are any of the inputs to the chip coming from TTL? Standby-drain specs for CMOS chips typically apply only if inputs are pulled all the way down to zero or all the way up to Vcc. TTL isn't good at doing the former and it won't do the latter at all without help from pullup resistors. This sort of thing can easily multiply power consumption by a considerable factor, because the CMOS transistors that are supposed to be OFF aren't all the way hard OFF. 
sci.electronics	 I had a catalog with membrane keypads, but I dunno what happened to it, and it was so long ago that I forget the name of the company. Anyway, you could make your own legend and slip it behind the bezel. Really nice and reasonably priced. Can anyone tell me where to get some more of these critters? I've tried several places, but none of them seem to have keypads which allow you to use your own legend. 
sci.electronics	 Yeesh, you WILL be nailing those IRLEDs. May I suggest getting your mitts on the Siemens SFH484-2 IRLED? This unit is designed to take some big current pulses if you can get your duty cycle down a bit. It will output nearly a watt (975 mW) with REAL short duty cycle times. 
sci.electronics	 I have notice a lot of electronics questions by people who are obviously not "tuned-in" to electronics. Many of them have rather simple answers, and many of them require a circuit diagram. 
sci.electronics	 I second that suggestion. Although I don't own the HP Portable Deskjet, I *do* own the HP Deskjet 500. It gives the nicest outputs, with only a minor loss of quality. For all intensive purposes (papers, letters, resumes), I treat my Deskjet like a laser printer (You *do* have to look a bit closely to see the blurs in the characters). Only one grudge, the ink that HP gives you does smudge rather quickly in the presence of moisture (Even though the ink is waterproof). However, you would have to spend about $500 more for laser quality. 
sci.electronics	 I would suggest Draw for Windows (by Micrografx). I have this on my home box. Its quite impressive and only cost UKL100. It has a rather nice clip-art library facility which you can expand with your own drawings. There is no circuit component clip-art included, but you could add your own quite easily. 
sci.electronics	 Take a lemon. Stick a copper strip into the lemon. Stick a galvanized nail in about 1 to 1-1/2 inches from the copper strip. You should get about 1/2 volt from it - enough to light an LED. 
sci.electronics	 You can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book, "The Hungry Hiker's Guide to Good Food," by Gretchen McHugh. The heat source is a 100 watt light bulb. Basically, it's a vertical wooden box with ventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the air to flow). The light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks are spaced every 6" starting about 10" above the bulb.

sci.electronics	 I know what the 68HC811E2 is all about, but I'm trying to figure out what the 68SEC811E2 is... specifically, what does the SEC stand for? 
sci.electronics	 I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and word has it that something similar is on its way here. Since we apparently don't have the sensor base you folks have, they're installing cameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial tests are going to be in the Santa Clara area I'm told), with the video being piped into a command center they're building somewhere in the East Bay. I'm not sure if frame grabbers or cheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but large multi-colored status displays will show the various routes using different colors to represent the various average speeds for each stretch of highway. An announcer will sit in front of the status 'wall', and will relay continuous verbal traffic status to those who want to receive it. They're apparently also looking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated to providing continuous audio from this system. 
sci.electronics	 I seem to remember that they sell the information (and a computer connection) to anyone willing to pay. 
sci.electronics	 Try the folks at Dimolex Corp., La Crescenta, CA 91214. Their number is (818) 957-7001. They make membrane keypads that are very flat, in layouts from 2 to 128 keys. They have standard models, tactile models (with stainless domes under each key to make a 'click' you can feel), as well as backlit models. Some of them can even be cut with scissors to form a funky shape other than a rectangle. Many of the models are available in a 'kit' which includes a bezel, colored and plain key covers, and rub on lettering to make your own layout. One piece prices aren't cheap, though, as they want $10 for one four position pad *kit*, and $45 for a 40 position *kit*. 
sci.electronics	 I've seen them in surplus stores. All they are are fluorescent bulbs without the phosphor, and a UV transparent bulb (special glass). I've also seen incandescent versions that you screw into an ordinary 120VAC socket, probably not what you want. 
sci.electronics	 I've used on-chip capacitors to reduce ground-bounce noise on a small systolic array chip that had 50pF loads on the clock lines. (Design was in 2-micron n-well cmos, using the MOSIS scalable design rules.) Here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors: 
sci.electronics	 Name your price, cap colours & quantity available. cheers Mike 
sci.electronics	 try comp.dcom - I was reading a thread a while back about an 800 number that you could dial. worked here. It was a sales line for sprint I think telling you that you could have all your customers numbers using there ANI, then it told you your number. Should work with any modern switch.

sci.electronics	 Try Parts Express in Dayton, Ohio also. They have a complete line of professional arcade buttons, joysticks etc... 
sci.electronics	 Actually detecting a BREAK is done by watching for a "character" containing all zero bits with the framing error resulting from its receipt. This means that the line stayed in the zero bit state even past the stop bit time slot, which basically indicates a BREAK. There is no special way to detect BREAK that I have found other than this -- there's no magic signal generated by UARTs, etc. 
sci.electronics	 That's a standby unit not a UPS, otherwise there would be no interuption. Many standby units are labled as UPS's though. Morgan Bullard mb4008@coewl.cen.uiuc.edu or mjbb@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu 
sci.electronics	 I missed the first part of this thread; are you switching line level or speaker level audio? If line level, there's a single chip 4x1 *stereo* audio switch available that switches 4 two-channel inputs into 1 two-channel output, and also has a mute function, all controllable with ttl inputs. LM1037, I think? 
sci.electronics	 Actually, it's HAPP, and some of their equipment can be found in the Parts Express catalog (1-800-338-0531). They show switches for $2, joysticks for $13 and trackballs for $80. They also have pinball parts. 
sci.electronics	 I'm wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the distance between a transmitter(s) and receiver? 
sci.electronics	 It's made by Rohm. (as is all BAxxx parts). Call 714-855-2131 and ask if you can get a sample (it's only like a $2 part). 
sci.electronics	 Motorola has a good app note on a 10 band equalizer using a 56000 DSP. It could be easily ported to an Ariel board, or even a Turtle Beach 56K development system.

sci.med	 I second what Spenser Aden said in reply. Additionally, it is hard to say what type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say how long you have been on it. Patients are generally kept on steroids for months before thinking about tapering. Alternatives to daily dosing are every other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start. Another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start azathioprine. Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug in addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine. A lot of the specifics about options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration of disease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what it is worth. 
sci.med	 I know of a patient who was severely and chronically depressed and tried to kill himself with a bullet to the temple. He essentially gave himself a prefrontal lobotomy, curing the depression. 
sci.med	 Ron, you're an endless source of misinformation! There ARE no sacral vertebrae. There is a bone called the sacrum at the end of the spine. It is a single, solid bone except in a few patients who have a lumbarized S1 as a normal variant. How do you adjust a solid bone, break it? No, don't tell me, I don't want to know. 
sci.med	 OOPS. My original message died. I'll try again... I always understood (perhaps wrongly...:)) that the bacteria in our digestive tracts help us break down the components of milk. Perhaps the normal flora of the intestine changes as one passes from childhood. Is there a pathologist or microbiologist in the house? 
sci.med	 The answer to your first question is rather difficult to answer without doing a lot of autopsies. The second question is something that's been known for some time. It appears that within about 15 years of quitting smoking a person's risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of the person who never smoked (assuming you do not get lung cancer in the interim!). The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack per day for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker. Still rather low overall, but significant. Personally, I'd be more concerned about heart disease secondary to smoking -- it's much more common, and even a small increase in risk is significant there. 
sci.med	 Oh come now, surely you know he only meant to measure the flow of electromagnetic energy about the sacrum and then adjust these flows with a crystal of chromium applied to the right great toe. Don't you know anything? 
sci.med	 Well, yes. That was a part of my point. Aspirin has its problems, but in some situations it is useful. Ditto stuff like licorice root. Taking anything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea of taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted, additional effects. Taking any drug when the potential ill-effects are not known is a risk assumed by the parties involved, and it may be that in a given situation the risk is worthwhile. Like Prozac, for instance; Prozac has been shown to be theraputic in some cases where the tri-cyclics fail. But Prozac hasn't been in use that long, and it really isn't clear what if any effects it may have when taken over long periods of time, even though it has been tested by present day standards. Should Prozac be taken off the market because long-term effects, if any, are not known? IMHO, i'd say no. 
sci.med	 A friend of mine has a trouble with her ears ringing. The ringing is so loud that she has great difficulty sleeping at night. She says that she hasn't had a normal night's sleep in about 6 months (she looks like it too :-(). This is making her depressed so her doctor has put her on anti-depressants. 
sci.med	 I'm surprised nobody mentioned that twitching of the eyelid can be a symptom of an infection, especially if it also itches or stings. (It happened to me, and antibiotic eyedrops cleared it up nicely.) 
sci.med	 No. That these drugs happen to be useful as antidepressants is neither here nor there. 
sci.med	 You certainly do not see OTC preparations advertised as such. The only such ridiculous concoctions are nostrums for premenstrual syndrome, ostensibly to treat headache and "bloating" simultaneously. They're worthless. 
sci.med	 Sometimes I have a problem with doctor's prescribing medicine like this. I of course don't know the exact situation, and anti-depressants may work, but it isn't helping the ringing at all, is it? 
sci.med	 A friend of mine is going in later this week for tests to see if has emphysema. His lung capacity has decreased over time. His father died of the disease. He works in woodworking. I believe he has a very occasional cigarette, perhaps one cigarette a day or even less. He tells me this..I've never seen him light up. He has some pretty healthy life style habits, good diet, exercise, meditation, retreats, therapy etc. Anyhow..he is very concerned with this check up. I know really nothing about the disease. I believe it interferes with the lining of the lung being able to exchange oxygen. 
sci.med	 I don't think that's a problem. My face is quite oily too. I had a moderate acne problem for many years. I then found that if I vigorously scrub my face with a nail brush and soap (Irish Spring) twice a day the acne was not a problem. I can still leave a pretty health nose print on a mirror after 45 min (don't ask ;-) but acne is not a real problem anymore.

We always came home with a nasty case of jiggers (large red bumps where the buggers had burrowed into the skin). My mother would paint the bumps with clear finger nail polish. This was repeated daily for about a week or so. The application of the polish is supposed to suffocate them as it seals of the skin. All I can say is it worked for us. One word of caution though. Putting finger nail polish on a jigger bite stings like hell. 
sci.med	 My 14-y-o son has the usual teenage spotty chin and greasy nose. I bought him Clearasil face wash and ointment. I think that is probably enough, along with the usual good diet. However, he is on at me to get some product called Dalacin T, which used to be a doctor's-prescription only treatment but is not available over the chemist's counter. I have asked a couple of pharmacists who say either his acne is not severe enough for Dalacin T, or that Clearasil is OK. I had the odd spots as a teenager, nothing serious. His father was the same, so I don't figure his acne is going to escalate into something disfiguring. But I know kids are senstitive about their appearance. I am wary because a neighbour's son had this wierd malady that was eventually put down to an overdose of vitamin A from acne treatment. I want to help - but with appropriate treatment.

sci.med	 A very simple question : it seems to me that the contraceptive pill just prevents the ovule to nest in the vagina and forces it to fall every month.

sci.med	 Actually that is not how the pill works, but it *is* how the IUD works. The oral contraceptive pill actually *prevents* ovulation from occuring by providing negatve feedback to the pituitary gland, and thus preventing the LH surge that normally occurs at the time of ovulation. With the IUD what happens is that fertilization may occur, but the device prevents implantation within the wall of the uterus (*not* the vagina).

sci.med	 My wife breast-fed my three boys 12 months, 16 months, and 29 months respectively and they are 18, 16, and 10 years old respectively. So far everybody seems fairly normal. I noticed a negative correlation with ear infections and length of time nursed in my very small sample. I do notice that the 16 and 18 year old seem to eat a lot, could that be from the breast feeding :-) ? 
sci.med	 This is regarding recurrent volvulus which our little boy has been suffering from ever since he was an infant. He had a surgery when he was one year old. Another surgery had to be performed one year after, when he was two years old. He turned three this February and he is still getting afflicted by this illness, like having to get hospitalised for vomitting and accompanying stomach pain.He managed not having a third surgery so far. 
sci.med	 Seems to me that I read in either a recent NY Times Science Times or maybe it was Science News that there is evidence that ex-smoker's risk of lung cancer never returns to that of a person who has never smoked (I think it may get close). I'll find the article and post it since my memory is hazy on the specifics - if you are interested. 
sci.med	 30mg per day of propranolol is a homeopathic dose in migraine. If you got fatigued at that level, it is unlikely that you will tolerate enough beta blocker to help you. 
sci.med	 Stimulation of the vagus nerve slows the heart and drops the blood pressure. 
sci.med	 I just found out about the sublinguals disappearing too. I don't know why. Perhaps because they weren't as profitable as cafergot. Too bad, since tablets are sometimes vomited up by migraine patients and they don't do any good flushed down the toilet. I suspect we'll be moving those patients more and more to the DHE nasal spray, which is far more effective. 
sci.med	 How long ago was this? When I said you'd get counselling, I meant if you did it now. Long ago, practices varied and agencies had to gear up to provide the counselling. 
sci.med	 I agree. Adding layers of managers and bureaucrats simply eat up money that could be spent on those who actually are doing the work such as doctors and nurse, and supplies. The most efficient system is probably one that has limited management and a fixed budget such as England's or even Canada's. I'm afraid we are on the wrong track. The problem may be that the insurance lobby is too powerful. 
sci.med	 I'm not sure about that. Did you see the "poll" they took that showed that most people thought physicians should be paid $80,000 per year tops? That's all I make, but I doubt that most physicians are going to work very hard for that kind of bread. Many wouldn't be able to service their med school debts on that. Mike Royko had a good column about it. 
sci.med	 IMHO, the original poster has no business soliciting diagnoses off the net, nor does Dr./Mr. O'Donnell have any business supplying same. This is one major reason real physicians avoid this newsgroup like the plague. It is also another example of the double standard: if I as a physician offered to diagnose and treat on the net, I can be sued. But people without qualifications are free to do whatever they want and disclaim it all with "I'm not a doctor." 
sci.med	 Herman, I would think you of all people would/could distinguish between "health" and "treatment of disease." All the prevention medicine people preach this all the time. You cannot buy health. You can buy treatment of disease, assuming you are lucky enough to have a disease which can be treated. A rich person with a terminal disease is a bit out of luck. There is no such thing as "adequately covered" and there never will be. 
sci.med	 I do not know a lot about this, except from seeing one patient with "Kartagener's syndrome", which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome in which there is situs inversus, bronchiectasis, and chronic infections. "Situs inversus" means that organs are on the wrong side of the body, and can be complete or partial. It is interesting medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part by the "normal" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in absence of this, laterality can be "random." People with situs inversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their rarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they can't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong side). 
sci.med	 Purists often distinguish between "true" clubbing and "pseudo" clubbing, the difference being that with "true" clubbing the angle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantly negative when proceeding distally (towards the fingertip). With "pseudo" clubbing, the angle is initially positive, then negative, which is the normal situation. "Real" internists can talk for hours about clubbing. I'm limited to a couple of minutes. 
sci.med	 There are many organisms, viral, bacterial, and fungal, which can cause meningitits, and the course of these infections varies widely. The causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age: in adults pneumococcus (the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia) is the most common cause, while in children Hemophilus influenzae is the most common cause. 
sci.med	 It's O- that is especially useful. Still, he isn't punishing the Red Cross but some O+ person that needed his blood and couldn't get it. You are right, nagging probably won't help. 
sci.med	 Why do you think Steere is doing this? Isn't he acting in good faith? After all, as the "discoverer" of Lyme for all intents and purposes, the more famous Lyme gets, the more famous Steere gets. I don't see the ulterior motive here. It is easy for me to see it the those physicians who call everything lyme and treat everything. There is a lot of money involved. 
sci.med	 What does "DC" stand for? Couldn't be an antichiropractic posting from a chiropractor, could it? My curiosity is piqued. 
sci.med	 No, the neiseria meningococcus is one of the most common forms of meningitis. It's the one that sometimes sweeps schools or boot camp. It is contagious and kills by attacking the covering of the brain, causing the blood vessels to thrombose and the brain to swell up. 
sci.med	 Where did you read this? I don't think this is true. I think most medical treatments are based on science, although it is difficult to prove anything with certitude. It is true that there are some things that have just been found "to work", but we have no good explanation for why. But almost everything does have a scientific rationale. The most common treatment for prostate cancer is probably hormone therapy. It has been "proven" to work. So have radiation and chemotherapy. What treatments did the article say are not proven? 
sci.med	 I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly, (motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines. But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've found them to be ineffective. However, I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn). First, is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much worse at midcycle. I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back. I've tried Synarel, it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately after I stopped. Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only "real solution" to my problem. Although I don't expect to have any more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis). One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children. So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain. This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it). In fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both legs) as I'll discuss in a moment. Generally though, I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while). In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain. 
sci.med	 didn't have any luck with clearasil. Even though my skin gets oily it really only gets miserable pimples when it's dry. 
sci.med	 I may not be the world's greatest expert on chiggers (a type of mite indigenous to the south), but I certainly have spent a lot of time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years (since we moved to N.C.). Here are some observations gained from painful experience: 
sci.med	 Undoubtedly it does, to maintain such a weight. And it does so primarily by overeating. If it didn't, the weight would drop back to normal. 
sci.med	 Yes, I remember that now. Well, in that case, the cones are indeed color sensitive, contrary to what the original respondent had claimed. 
sci.med	 Two approaches that I've used: Tofranil, 50 mg qhs, Naproxen 250mg bid. The Naproxen doesn't seem to be as bad as things like Tylenol in promoting the analgesic abuse Headache. DHE IV infusions for about 3 days (in hospital). Cold turkey is the only way I think. Tapering doesn't help. I wouldn't know how you can do this without your doctor. I haven't seen anyone successfully do it alone. Doesn't mean it can't be done. 
sci.med	 No, no, we aren't talking about receptors for the brain's sensory innervation, but structures such as the thalamus that handle pain for the entire organism. Apples and oranges. 
sci.med	 Who knows in this legal climate, but there is tremendous legal precendent for forcibly quarantining TB patients in sanitariums. 100 yrs ago it was done all the time. It has been done sporadically all along in patients who won't take their medicine. If you have TB you may find yourself under surveilence of the Public Health Department and you may find they have the legal power to insist you make your clinic visits. 
sci.med	 Extremely rare in humans. Usually so much else is involved you'd just have a mess to sort out. Birds do all vision in the tectum, don't they? 
sci.med	 The speculum is the little cone that fits on the end of the otoscope. There are also vaginal specula that females and gynecologists are all too familiar with. 
sci.med	 Probably she meant that your blood pressure went up while you were on the treadmill. This is normal. You'll have to ask her if this is what she meant, since no one else can answer for another person. 
sci.med	 It isn't that rare, actually. Many cases that are called Parkinson's Disease turn out on autopsy to be SND. It should be suspected in any case of Parkinsonism without tremor and which does not respond to L-dopa therapy. I don't believe pallidotomy will do much for SND. 
sci.med	 Be sure to say "chronic" dizziness, not just dizziness. Most patients with acute or subacute dizziness will get better. The vertiginous spells of Meniere's will also eventually go away, however, the patient is left with a deaf ear. 
sci.med	 I'm sure the Pittsburgh group has published the baboon work, but I don't know where. In Chicago they were doing lobe transplants from living donors, and I'm sure they've published. I don't read the transplant literature. I just see the liver transplant patients when they get into neurologic trouble (pretty frequent), so that and the newspapers and scuttlebutt is the way I keep up with what they are doing. Howard Doyle works with them, and can tell you more. 
sci.med	 If these folks are who I think they are, Lyme-knowledgeable may mean a physician to whom everything that walks in the door is lyme disease, and you will be treated for lyme, whether or not you have it. Hope you have good insurance. 
sci.med	 Short of changes by the feds, there is no way. Codeine alone is very difficult to prescribe without a lot of hassles. Tylenol #3 is the best compromise. That way he can get refills. The amount of acetominophen he is getting with his codeine won't hurt him any. 
sci.med	 I'm not sure it is the fluctuation so much as the estrogen level. Taking Premarin can certainly cause migraines in some women. 
sci.med	 The flushing is due to vascular dilation, part of a migraine attack. Some people event get puffy and swollen. As long as you are careful you can see well enough to avoid getting hit in the face or eye by the ball, migraine will not hurt your health. 
sci.med	 Several years ago I tried to commit a patient who was growing Salmonella out of his stool, blood, and an open ulcer for treatment. The idea was that the guy was a walking public health risk, and that forcing him to receive IV antibiotics for a few days was in the public interest. I will make a long story short by saying that the judge laughed at my idea, yelled at me for wasting his time, and let the guy go. 
sci.med	 Probably would not be fatal in an adult at that dose, but could kill a child. Patient would be very somnolent, with dilated pupils, low blood pressure. Possibly cardiac arrhythmias. 
sci.med	 Gosh, Jesse is that famous now? He was my intern. Landau not liking it makes me like it out of spite. (Just kidding, Bill). 
sci.med	 Try peeling the skin back at the base of your other fingernails (not too hard, now, don't want to hurt yourself). You'll find nice little lunulas there if you can peel it back enough. 
sci.med	 I agree that some specialties have gotten way out of line. The main problem is the payment method for procedures rather than time distorts the system. I hope they will fix that. But I'm afraid, as usual, the local doc is going to take the brunt. People grouse about paying $50 to see their home doctor in his office, but don't mind paying $20,000 to have brain surgery. They think their local doc is cheating them but worship the feet of the neurosurgeon who saved their life. What they don't realize is that we need more local docs and fewer 
sci.med	 It can suppress secretion of prolactin. Is useful in cases of galactorrhea. Some adenomas of the pituitary secret too much. 
sci.med	 Dangerous only to immune suppressed persons and fetuses. To them, it is extremely dangerous. Most of the rest of us have already had it and it isn't dangerous at all. 
sci.med	 Gordon Banks N3JXP | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu | it is shameful to surrender it too soon." 
sci.med	 If people are going to do this, I really wish they would tell me first. I'd be happy to go over the insert (in the PDR) with them and explain everything. All too many patients read the insert and panic and then on the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug and we are starting over again at square one. Some of them probably didn't even come back for followup because they didn't want to admit they wouldn't take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or something. What people don't understand about the inserts is that they report every adverse side effect ever reported, without substantiating that the drug was responsible. The insert is a legal document to slough liability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to happen. If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information on a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the AMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific. There are very few drugs that someone hasn't reported a death from taking. Patients don't realize that and don't usually appreciate the risks to themselves properly. I'm sure Herman is going to "go ballistic", but so be it. Another problem is that probably most drugs have been reported to cause impotence. Half the males who read that will falsely assume it could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will refuse to take any drug like that. This can be a real problem for PDR readers. There needs to be some way of providing patients with tools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need. I am involved in a research project to do that, with migraine as the domain. It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions about migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient. For common illnesses, such as migraine and hypertension, this may help quite a bit. The patient could spend as much time as needed with the computer and this would then not burden the physician. Clearly, physicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have, as is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked things that the patients should have found out from their physician but didn't. Why they didn't isn't always the physician's fault either. Sometimes the patients are afraid to ask. They won't be as afraid to ask the system, we hope. 
sci.med	 I think in Illinois venereal disease (the old ones, not AIDS) was included. Syphillis was, for sure. 
sci.med	 Not that new. 20 years ago, we had drug addicts harboring active TB that was resistant to everything (in Chicago). The difference now is that such strains have become virulent. In the old days, such TB was weak. It didn't spread to other people very easily and just infected the one person in whom it developed (because of non-compliance with medications). Non-compliance and development of resistant strains has been a problem for a very long time. That is why we have like 9 drugs against TB. There is always a need to develop new ones due to such strains. Now, however, with a virulent resistant strain, we are in more trouble, and measures to assure compliance may be necessary even if they entail force. 
sci.med	 The only fungus I know of from California is Coccidiomycosis. I hadn't heard that it attacked bone. It attacks lung and if you are especially unlucky, the central nervous system. Nothing new about it. It's been around for years. THey call it "valley fever", since it is found in the inland valleys, not on the coast. 
sci.med	 You can probably get this information by calling your public health department in your county (in Pittsburgh, they give the shots free, as well). There are bulletins in medical libraries that give recommendations, or you could call the infectious diseases section of the medicine department of your local medical school. You also will probably want to talk about Malaria prophylaxis. You will need your doctor to get the prescription. 
sci.med	 Compartment syndrome occurs when swelling happens in a "compartment" bounded by fascia. The pressure rises in the compartment and blood supply and nerves are compromised. The treatment is to open the compartment surgically. THe most common places for compartment syndromes are the forearm and calf. It is an emergency, since if the pressure is not relieved, stuff will die. 
sci.med	 The yearly chest x-ray provides a minute amount of radiation. It is a drop in the bucket as far as increased risk is concerned. Who can tell you whether you can get out of it or not? No one here controls that. It may well be a matter of the law, in which case, write your legislator, but don't hold your breath. 
sci.med	 dictionary (which I did when this question first surfaced), the first definition is "a mirror or polished metal plate used as a reflector in optical instruments." 
sci.med	 I attended high school in the San Jose, California area in the early 1980's, and I remember a (smallish) outbreak of a strange illness, in which people developed measles-like spots on their bodies. This condition seemed to last only a few days, and I don't recall anyone reporting any other symptoms. I seem to recall reading somewhere that this was believed to have been viral in nature, but I don't know for sure. 
sci.med	 Assuming one has been cultured as having a throat laden with neiseria meningococcus and given (and taken) a course of ERYC without the culture becoming negative, should one worry about being a carrier? 
sci.med	 I *believe* there is a known synergism between certain analgesics and caffiene. For treating pain, not inflammation. 
sci.med	 I'm not sure who the "original respondent" was but to reiterate cones respond to particular portions of the spectrum, just as _rods_ respond to certain parts of the visible spectrum (bluegreen in our case, reddish in certain amphibia), just as the hoseshoe crab _Limulus polyphemus_ photoreceptors respond to a certain portion of the spectrum etc. It is a common misconception to confound wavelength specificity with being color sensitive, however the two are not synonymous. So in sum and to beat a dead horse: (1) When the outputs of a cone are matched for number of absorbed photons _irrespective_ of the absorbed photons wavelength, the cone outputs are _indistinguishable_. (2) Cones are simply detectors with different spectral sensitivities and are not any more "color sensitive" than are rods, ommatidia or other photoreceptors. (3) Color vision arises because outputs of receptors which sample different parts of the spectrum (cones in this case) are "processed centrally". (The handwave is intentional) 
sci.med	 The case report of the first xenotransplant was published in Lancet 1993; 341:65-71. I can send you a reprint if you are interested. There was another paper, sort of a tour of the horizon, written by Starzl and published in the Resident's Edition of the Annals of Surgery (vol 216, October 1992). It's in the Surgical Resident's Newsletter section, so you won't find it in the regular issue of the Annals. I don't have any reprints of that one. A paper has been accepted for publication by Immunology Today, though I'm not sure when it's coming out, describing our experience with the two xenografts done to date. 
sci.med	 The biggest reason why the cost of medical care is so EXTREMELY high and increasing is that NATURAL methods of treatment and even diagnosis are still being SYSTEMATICALLY IGNORED and SUPPRESSED by the MONEY-GRUBBING and POWER- MONGERING "medical" establishment. Some examples of very low cost NATURAL ANTI-cancer Remedies are listed in the following article: 
sci.med	 There is a mini-epidemic of Coccidiodes that is occurring in, I believe, the Owen's Valley/ Bishop area east of the Sierras. I don't believe there has been any great insight into the increased incidence in that area. There is a low-level of endemic infection in that region. Many people with evidence of past exposure to the organism did not have serious disease. 
sci.med	 I am currently doing a group research project on the drug Xanax. I would be exponentially gracious to receive any and all information you could provide me regarding its usage, history, mechanism of reaction, side effects, and other pertinent information. I don't care how long or how short your response is.

sci.med	 You are making precisely one of the points I wanted to make. I fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the *process* of science and the end result. 
sci.med	 Yup. By the way, what planet are you from, and once you got here, did you encounter those prejudices against foreign medical graduates? 
sci.med	 If you could not tell which one had MSG, why restaurants bother to use it at all? 
sci.med	 There's a pretty good article in the the March 6, 1993 New Scientist titled "Pouring cold water on Lorenzo's oil". The article states that research has shown that the oil has no discernable effect on the progression of the disease in patients in which demyelination has begun. In patients with AMN (a less acute form of the same disease) there is some improvement seen in the ability of nerve fibres to conduct impulses. In ALD patients who have not yet begun demyelination, the jury is still out. 
sci.med	 I am posting to this group in hopes of finding someone out there in network newsland who has heard of something similar to what I am going to describe here. I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced a seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's Frosted Flakes. She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like this before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the family. All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decision was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again. 
sci.med	 And to add further fuel to the flame war, I read about 20 years ago that the "natural" MSG - extracted from the sources you mention above - does not cause the reported aftereffects; it's only that nasty "artificial" MSG - extracted from coal tar or whatever - that causes Chinese Restaurant Syndrome. I find this pretty hard to believe; has anyone else heard it? 
sci.med	 And has been rather thoroughly demolished as myth by Robert Scott Root- Bernstein. See his book, "Discovering". Ring structures for benzene had been proposed before Kekule', after him, and at the same time as him. The current models do not resemble Kekule's. Many of the predecessors of Kekule's structure resemble the modern model more. 
sci.med	 Well, let me put it this way, based on my own experience. A general practitioner with no training in infectious diseases, by establishing links to the "Lyme community", treating patients who come to him wondering about lyme or having decided they have lyme as if they did, saying that diseases such as MS are probably spirochetal, if not Lyme, giving talks at meetings of users groups, validating the feelings of even delusional patients, etc. This GP can go from being a run-of-the-mill $100K/yr GP to someone with lots of patients in the hospital and getting expensive infusions that need monitoring in his office, and making lots of bread. Also getting the adulation of many who believe his is their only hope (if not of cure, then of control) and seeing his name in publications put out by support groups, etc. This is a definite temptation. 
sci.med	 We were talking about Migraine and Exercise (I'm the one who can't fathom the thought of exercise during migraine...). Anyway, turning the thread around, the other day I played tennis during my lunch hour. I'm out of tennis shape so it was very intense exercise. I got overheated, and dehydrated. Afterwards, I noticed a tingling sensation all over my head then about 2 hours later, I could feel a migraine start. (I continued to drink water in the afternoon.) I took cafergot, but it didn't help and the pain started although it wasn't as intense as it usually is and about 9pm that night, the pain subsided. 
sci.med	 If the nose culture shows Staph, then Ceftin or even Ceclor are better. Suprax does not kill Staph. Treating bacterial infections involves a lot of try-and-fail because the infections often involve multiple organisms with many resistant strains. Some 60% of Hemophilus Influenza strains are now resistant. What works for me and my organisms may not work for you and yours. Keep experimenting. Ken Colby 
sci.med	 Carl, it is not "placebo effect" if as hypothesised the sensory response to MSG's effect on flavor is responsible for the MSG reaction. 
sci.med	 Probably within 50 years, a new type of eugenics will be possible. Maybe even sooner. We are now mapping the human genome. We will then start to work on manipulation of that genome. Using genetic engineering, we will be able to insert whatever genes we want. No breeding, no "hybrids", etc. The ethical question is, should we do this? Should we make a race of disease-free, long-lived, Arnold Schwartzenegger-muscled, supermen? Even if we can. 
sci.med	 I am told (by the person who I care a lot about and who I am worried is going to start putting his health and money into homeopathy without really knowing what he is getting into and who is the reason I posted in the first place about homeopathy) that in Britain homeopathy is available on the National Health Service and that there are about 6000 GPs who use homeopathic practices. True? False? What? 
sci.med	 OK, just for grins: - Kekule hypothesized a resonant structure for the aromatic benzene ring after waking from a dream in which a snake was swallowing his tail. - Archimedes formalized the principle of buoyancy while meditating in his bath. 
sci.med	 Yes, but typically they *don't*. Not every wild flight of fancy serves (or can serve) in the appropriate relation to a hypothesis. It is somewhat interesting that when anyone is challanged to provide an example of this sort the *only* one they come up with is the one about Kekule. Surely, there must be others. But apparently this is regarded as an *extreme* example of a "non-rational" process in science whereby a successful hypothesis was proposed. But how non-rational is it? 
sci.med	 Thanks for all your assistance. I'll see if he can try a different brand of patches, although he's tried two brands already. Are there more than two? 
sci.med	 I think that Lee Lady and I are talking at cross purposes. Above, Lady seems concerned with the contrast between great science that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre science that makes smaller steps. In most of this thread, I have been concerned with the difference between what is science and what is not. 
sci.med	 Yeah, but the problem with holding up the "extra-rational" examples as exemplars, or as refutations of well founded methodology, is that you run smack up against such unuseful directions as Lysenko. Such "extra- rational" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology. 
sci.med	 You can also swab the inside of your nose with Bacitracin using a Q tip. Bacitracin is an antibiotic that can be bought OTC as an ointment in a tube. The doctor I listen to on the radio says to apply it for 30 days, while you are taking other antibiotics by mouth. 
sci.med	 Here is another anecdotal story. I am a picky eater and never wanted to try chinese food, however, I finally tried some in order to please a girl I was seeing at the time. I had never heard of Chinese restaurant syndrome. A group of us went to the restaurant and all shared 6 different dishes. It didn't taste great, but I decided it wasn't so bad. We went home and went to bed early. I woke up at 2 AM and puked my guts outs. I threw up for so long that (I'm not kidding) I pulled a muscle in my tongue. Dry heaves and everything. No one else got sick, and I'm not allergic to anything that I know of. 
sci.med	 Well, certainly in Archimedes case the description "while observing the phenomena in his bath" seems more accurate than "while meditating in his bath" -- it was, after all, a rather buoyancy intense environment. 
sci.med	 The funny thing is the personaly stories about reactions to MSG vary so greatly. Some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face. Some claim their heart "skipped" beats once in a while. Some reacted with headache, some stomach ache. Some had watery eyes or running nose, some had itchy skin or rashes. More serious accusations include respiration difficulty and brain damage. 
sci.med	 I had a similar reaction to Chinese food but came to a completly different conclusion. I've eaten Chinese food for ages and never had problems. I went with some Chinese Malaysian friends to a swanky Chinses rest. and they ordered lots of stuff I had never seen before. The only thing I can remember of that meal was the first course, scallops served in the shell with a soy-type sauce. I thought, "Well, I've only had scallops once and I was sick after but that could have been a coincidence". That night as I sat on the bathroom floor, sweating and emptying my stomach the hard way, I decided I would never touch another scallop. I may not be allergic but I don't want to take the chance. 
sci.med	 I've gotten migraines after exercise, though for me it seems to be related to exercising without having eaten recently. 
sci.med	 This example is probably wrong. There is the case of one famous physicist telling another that he was probably wrong. As I recall the quote: 
sci.med	 As has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_ and _method_. No experimental result should be accepted unless it is described in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications do indeed reproduce the result. No theoretical argument should be accepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and reasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.

sci.med	 Kekule saw between it and his problem is fortunate but not extraordinary. I, for example, often receive/conjure solutions (hypotheses for solutions) to my everyday problems at moments when I appear to myself to be occupied with activities quite removed. Algorithms for that new software feature come when I trample the meadow on my occasional runs. Alternative (better) ways to instruct and rear my sons arrive while I weed the garden. I'll swear I am not thinking about any of it when ideas come. 
sci.med	 Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable. However it is also widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity. And in ordinary life, perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is indicative of a psychological disorder. In the extreme case, a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might make that he is unable to even leave the house.

sci.med	 It depends on the cause of the pneumonia. For treating bacterial pneumonia in young otherwise-healthy non-smokers, erythromycin is usually considered the antibiotic of choice, since it covers the two most-common pathogens: strep pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumoniae. 
sci.med	 Surprise surprise, different people react differently to different things. One slightly off the subject case in point. My brother got stung by a bee. I know he is allergic to bee stings, but that his reaction is severe localized swelling, not anaphylactic shock. I could not convince the doctors of that, however, because that's not written in their little rule book. 
sci.med	 Nothing unisual. Quote: 
sci.med	 I sometimes wonder if Kekule's dream wasn't just a wee bit influenced by aromatic solvent vapors ;-) heh heh. 
sci.med	 I have a BACK MACHINE and have had one since January. While I have not found it to be a panacea for my back pain, I think it has helped somewhat. It MAINLY acts to stretch muscles in the back and prevent spasms associated with pain. I am taking less pain medication than I was previously. The folks at BACK TECHNOLOGIES are VERY reluctant to honor their return policy. They extended my "warranty" period rather than allow me to return the machine when, after the first month or so, I was not thrilled with it. They encouraged me to continue to use it, abeit less vigourously. Like I said, I can't say it is a cure-all, but it keeps me stretched out and I am in less pain. 
sci.med	 Purely recreational. They get bored sitting in that rack all the time. 
sci.med	 As mentioned in Adiposity 101, only some experience weight rebound. The fact that you don't doesn't prove it doesn't happen to others. 
sci.med	 I know from personal experience that men CAN get yeast infections. I get rather nasty ones from time to time, mostly in the area of the scrotum and the base of the penis. They're nowhere near as dangerous for me as for many women, but goddamn does it hurt in the summertime! Even in the wintertime, when I sweat I get really uncomfy down there. The best thing I can do to keep it under control is keep my weight down and keep cool down there. Shorts in 60 degree weather, that kind of thing. And of course some occasional sun. 
sci.med	 My mom has just been diagnosed with cystic breast disease -- a big relief, as it was a lump that could have been cancer. Her doctor says she should go off caffeine and chocolate for 6 months, as well as stopping the estrogen she's been taking for menopause-related reasons. She's not thrilled with this, I think especially because she just gave up cigarettes -- soon she won't have any pleasures left! Now, I thought I'd heard that cystic breasts were common and not really a health risk. Is this accurate? If so, why is she being told to make various sacrifices to treat something that's not that big of a deal? 
sci.med	 can anyone give me more information regarding endometriosis? i heard it's a very common disease among women and if anyone can provide names of a specialist/surgeon in the north carolina research triangle park area (raleigh/durham/chapel hill) who is familiar with the condition, i would really appreciate it. 
sci.med	 I made a decision a while back that I will not be bullied into getting studies like a CT or MRI when I don't think they are indicated. If the patient won't accept my explanation of why I think the study would be a waste of time and money, I suggest a second opinion.

sci.med	 As an animal science student, I know that a number of animals transfer immunoglobin to thier young through thier milk. In fact, a calf _must_ have a sufficient amount of colostrum (early milk) within 12 hours to effectively develop the immune system, since for the first (less than) 24 hours the intestines are "open" to the IG passage. My question is, does this apply to human infants to any degree?

sci.med	 Unfortunately it was posted to alt.tasteless so the gross details were emphasized instead of th e actual scientific facts. 
sci.med	 No, obviously talking about Research Assistants. I favor a high protein, low fat diet, barely adequate salary on a fixed time schedule, four hours of sleep a night, continuous infusion of latte, unpredictable praise mixed randomly with anxiety-provoking, everpresent glances with lowered eyebrows, unrealistic promises of rapid publication, and every three months a dinner consisting of nothing but microbrewery ale and free pretzels. Actually, mine hails from San Diego, and indeed has more problems in Seattle in cold weather than in warm. 
sci.med	 Hello to everybody, I write here because I am kind of desperate. For about six weeks, I've been suffering on pains in my left head side, the left leg and sometimes the left arm. I made many tests (e.g. computer tomography, negative, lyme borreliosis, negative, all electrolytes in the blood in their correct range), they're all o.K., so I should be healthy. As a matter of fact, I am not feeling so. I was also at a Neurologist's too, he considered me healthy too. 
sci.med	 Hi there I'm suffering from Sarcoidosis at present. Although it's shown as a chronic & rare tissue disorder, it is thankfully NOT life threatening. 
sci.med	 Vitamin A (and I think vitamin D) in strong enough amounts can kill. The key words are DOSAGE and EXPOSURE MECHANISM. 
sci.med	 Sjogren's syndrome has been known to induce dryness in vaginal tissue as well as induce primary biliary cirrhosis. Otherwise the abdominal swelling could be due to a complication of Sjogren's known as pseudolymphoma which *can* produce a splenomegaly (enlarged spleen). She should definitely see a rheumatologist. 
sci.med	 I think we agree on much. However the paragraphs above seem to repeat uncritically the standard Kuhn/Lakatos/Feyerabend view of "progress" and "rationality" in science. Since I've addressed these issues in this newsgroup in the not too distant past, I won't go into them again now.

sci.med	 Subject: options before back surgery for protruding disc at L4-L5 From: Alex Miller, amiller@almaden.ibm.com Date: 13 Apr 93 18:30:42 GMT In article <2241@coyote.UUCP Alex Miller, amiller@almaden.ibm.com writes: After two weeks of limping around with an acute pain in my low back and right leg, my osteopath sent me to get an MRI which revealed a protruding (and extruded) disc at L4-L5. I went to a neurosurgeon who prescribed prednisole (a steroidal anti-inflamitory) and bed rest' "for several days. It's been nearly a week and overall I feel slightly worse - I take darvocet three times a day so I can deal with daily activities like preparing food and help me get to sleep. 
sci.med	 I was kind of half watching Street Stories last night and one of the segments was about this doctor in S.F. who provides a service of investigating treatment for various diseases. I'm pretty sure his name is Dr. Mark Renniger (sp?) or close to that. Did anyone else watch this? I'd like to get his correct name and address/phone number if possible. Thanks. 
sci.med	 I just wanted to point out that some of the food, particularly the soups, are prepared in a big batch, so the restaurant won't be able to take the MSG out of it. Sometimes its pretty hard to find out if this is the case or not. 
sci.med	 Though I can't imagine WANTING to have intercourse during a full-blown yeast infection :-) chances of it being transmitted to the male are quite low, especially if he's circumcised. But it can happen. At one point I was getting recurrent yeast infections and the Dr suspected my boyfriend might have gotten it from me and be reinfecting me. The prescription was interesting. For each day of the medication (a week) I was to insert the medication, then to have intercourse. The resulting action would help the medicine be spread around in me better, and would simultaneously treat him. 
sci.med	 Can anyone tell me if a bloodcount of 40 when diagnosed as hypoglycemic is dangerous, i.e. indicates a possible pancreatic problem? One Dr. says no, the other (not his specialty) says the first is negligent and that another blood test should be done. Also, what is a good diet (what has worked) for a hypo- glycemic? TIA. 
sci.med	 Check out #27903, just some 20 posts before your own. Maybe you missed it amidst the flurry of responses? Yet again, the use of this newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters they have substantial knowledge of. 
sci.med	 Flights of fancy, and other irrational approaches, are common. The crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they aren't of any use unless they make you do some experiments. I've known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they won't admit out loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers. 
sci.med	 Yeah, it might, if you only read the part you quoted. You somehow left out the part about "we all ate the same thing." Changes things a bit, eh? 
sci.med	 I feel the need to repeat myself: Kekule's dream is a rather bad example of much of anything. Read Root-Bernstein's book on the history of the benzene ring. 
sci.med	 Hmmm. The last time I got stung by a bee I experienced the same reaction the first poster's brother did. We went off to the doctor to see if I should worry about the fact that my foot was now about 3 times it's normal size. (And itched!!! Ow!) He basically said I shouldn't this time, but that bee sting allergy was not something you tended to get aclimatized to, but were something that each time got progressively worse generally and that next time could be the time I go into anaphylactic shock. Admittedly this was many years ago when I was young. Since then I just make sure I don't get stung. I also should carry a bee sting kit with me, but I don't. 
sci.med	 I have a new doctor who gave me a prescription today for something called Septra DS. He said it may cause GI problems and I have a sensitive stomach to begin with. Anybody ever taken this antibiotic. Any good? Suggestions for avoiding an upset stomach? Other tips?

sci.med	 Perhaps. Now, just what leads you to believe that it was MSG and not some other ingredient in the food that made you ill? 
sci.med	 Can anyone help me find any information on the drug Prozac? I am writing a report on the inventors , Eli Lilly and Co., and the product. I need as much help as I can get. Thanks a lot, Adriana Gilmete. 
sci.med	 I need advice with a situation which occurred between me and a physican which upset me. I saw this doctor for a problem with recurring pain. He suggested medication and a course of treatment, and told me that I need to call him 7 days after I begin the medication so that he may monitor its effectiveness, as well as my general health. 
sci.med	 First, I am not a doctor. I know about this because I have been through it. 
sci.med	 No, this is wrong. The purpose is to preserve the substances in the tubes longer by creating relativistic speeds and thus time dilatation. Of course, by slowing the subjective time of the test tubes they get less bored, which is probably what you were thinking of. 
sci.med	 Sounds as though his heart's in the right place, but he is not adept at expressing it. What you received was _meant_ to be a profound apology. Apologies delivered by overworked shy people often come out like that... 
sci.med	 The subject-line says it: every time I run a fever, I get an amazing rosy rash over my torso and arms. Fortunately, it doesn't itch. 
sci.med	 I don't react to scallops, but did have discomforts with clam juice served at (American) waterfront seafood bars. I don't know whether the juice is homemade or from cans. 
sci.med	 But why do you characterize this as a "flight of fancy" or a "fantasy"? While I am unfamiliar with the scientific context here, it appears obvious that his speculation (for lack of a better or more neutral word) was at least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance of current theory coupled with his observations. It would appear that something quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation into that theory (or to tailor the theory to cover the observation). This does not seem like an example of what most would normally call a flight of fancy or a fantasy. 
sci.med	 My name is Noah Dacumos and I am a student at San Leandro High. I am doing a project for my physics class and I would like some info on the discovery of penicillin, its discoverer(Sir Alexander Fleming), and how it helps people with many incurable bacterias. Also how it effects those who are allergic to it. Any info will be greatly appreciated. 
sci.med	 Endometriosis is where cells that would normally be lining the uteris exist outside the uteris. Sometimes this causes problems, often it doesn't. There is generally no need to remove pockets of endometriosis unless they are causing other problems. One lady I know had Endometriosis in an ovary. This caused her a _great_ deal of pain. Another lady I know has an endometrial cyst in her abdominal wall; she is not having it removed. 
sci.med	 It's worse than that -- there *is* no such thing as a double-blind study on the effects of MSG, by virtue of the fact that MSG changes the taste of food in a characteristic way that is detectable by the subject and that cannot be duplicated by a placebo. 
sci.med	 blood-brain barrier that I am not sure MSG can go through or not. In normal condition, the concentration of glutamate in the cerebrospinal fluid is about 2 uM that is high enough to activate one type of glutamate receptor-the NMDA receptor. But the question is Neuron and glial cell in the brain have a lots of transport to get glutamate into Neuron or glial. So no one know exact concentration of glutamate is around neurons.

The only information on this person I know is he was a biochemist that did research in the 1930's. I already did research at my local libraries, but I still need more information. My instructor is requiring resources from the computer networks. Please write back concerning my subject, any books, articles, etc., will be appreciated.

sci.med	 My daughter has Epilepsy and I attend a monthly parent support group. Just Wednesday night, a mother was telling how she decided to throw all the junk food out and see if it made a difference in her 13 year-old's seizures. He was having about one seizure per week. She reported that she did this on Thursday (3/11), he had a seizure on Saturday and then went 4 weeks without a seizure!! On Easter he went to Grandma's and ate candy, pop - anything he wanted. He had a seizure the next day. She sees sensitivity to nutrasweet, sugar, colors, caffine and corn. With corn she says, he gets very nervous and aggresive.

sci.med	 Unfortunately, Hep B infection can eventuate in chronic hepatitis and subsequent cirrhosis. Although not many patients with Hep B go on to chronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and is something to keep in mind. Hepatitis C (was: non-A, non-B Hep) much more frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis. There is also an autimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which also leads to cirrhosis.

sci.med	 GB From: geb@cs.pitt.edu (Gordon Banks) GB The HMO would stop the over-ordering, but in HMOs, tests are GB under-ordered. 
sci.med	 I'd dump him. Rude is rude and it seems he enjoys belittling and humiliating you. But don't just dump him, write to him and tell him why you are firing him. If you can, think about sending a copy of your letter to whoever is in charge of the clinic where he works, if applicable, or maybe even to the AMA. Don't be vindictive in your letter, be truthful but VERY firm. 
sci.med	 Yes, absolutely, though I'd make the observation in a more general sense of all observations are made by human beings and therefore made with various biases. 
sci.med	 Obviously, it wouldn't be of much help to treat one problem by knowingly introducing another. Cancer mestastizes. My imperfect understanding of the facts are that gonadal cancer is particularly dangerous in this regard. I haven't done the research on it, but I don't recall ever hearing of a case of cancer being transmitted by a blood transfusion. Probably just a common sense kind of arbitrary precaution. Transmissable diseases like malaria though are obviously another story. 
sci.med	 Elevated levels of Glu and Asp in the blood are able to bypass the Blood-brain barrier through the circumventricular organs (or CVO), in particular the adeno and neurohypophysis (pituitary gland) areas. The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the median eminence regions are particularly effected. CVO areas are not subject to the blood-brain barrier. These areas control the release of gonadotropin, which controls the release and flux of steroids governing development, especially sexual development. Changes in adult rats, which are less sensitive to Glu than humans, have been observed: after ingesting Glu, on a chronic basis, cycles of several steroids are disrupted. Blood levels of somatostatin are significantly reduced, and cyclic release of steroids becomes flattened. 
sci.med	 A friend of mine is having some symptoms and has asked me to post the following information.

sci.med	 The guy didn't sound too shy to me. He sounded like a jerk. I say ditch him for someone more knowledgeable and empathetic. 
sci.med	 Shades of James Watson! That's exactly the way many workers have described their misgivings about the Human Genome Project. If you take a rigid definition of scientific research, the mere accumulation of data is not doing science. One of the early arguments against the project were that the resources would be better used to focus on specific genetics-related problems rather than just going off and collecting maps and sequence. The project can't be so narrowly defined or easily described now though. 
sci.med	 Having had limited tinea pedis for more than 30 years, and finding it resistant to ALL creams and powders I have tried, I wonder why dermatologists do not use lasers to destroy the fungus. It would seem likely to be effective and inexpensive. Are there good reasons for not using lasers? I was told that dermatology had not yet reached the laser age. 
sci.med	 I have bad luck and got a VD called <Granuloma ingunale, which involves the growth of granules in the groin. I found out about it by checking medicine books and I found the prescriptions. And I know I can just go to a clinic to get it cured. BUT unfortunately I am serving my duty in the army right now and I think it's impossible to prevent anyone from knowing this if I take leaves every day for two weeks for treatment. Thus I bought the prescribed tablets at some drugstore, but to cure it I must get INJECTION of <Streptomycin, with a dose of 1g every 12 hours, for at least 10 days. I can probably buy the tools and this solution somewhere but I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO INJECTION BY MYSELF

sci.med	 Ming-zhou Liu's main problem is that he has an incompetent physician -- himself. This physician has diagnosed a problem, even though he probably has never seen the diagnosed disease before and has no idea of what kinds of problems can present similar symptoms. This physician now wants to treat his first case of this disease without any help from the medical community. 
sci.med	 Some recent postings remind me that I had read about risks associated with the barbecuing of foods, namely that carcinogens are generated. Is this a valid concern? If so, is it a function of the smoke or the elevated temperatures? Is it a function of the cooking elements, wood or charcoal vs. lava rocks? I wish to know more. Thanks. 
sci.med	 It would help if you (and anyone else asking for medical information on some subject) could ask specific questions, as no one is likely to type in a textbook chapter covering all aspects of the subject. If you are looking for a comprehensive review, ask your local hospital librarian. Most are happy to help with a request of this sort. 
sci.med	 This is a lovely area for anecdotes, but I am sure you are on to something. As a physician, I almost never get sick: usually, when something horrendous is going around, I either don't get it at all or get a very mild case. When I do get really sick, it is always something unusual. 
sci.med	 The danger in philosophizing about science is that theory and generalization can end up being far removed from the actual day-to-day of the grunt at the bench. Yes, its great to be involved in a process were I can walk into the lab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it (as long as my advisor doesn't catch me - which is easy enough to do), but stamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review committees and the peer review process in general. In today's world that's what determines what science is: what gets funded. And a damn good thing to. Flights of fantasy just don't have much chance of producing anything, at least not in biomedical research. The surest way for a graduate student to ruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with fleshing out his/her fantasies than with having the student work on a project that actually has a good chance of producing some results. MD's seem to be particularly prone to this aberrant behavior. 
sci.med	 Thanks to all who replied to my initial question. I've been away in New Jersey all week and was surprised to see all the responses when I got back. 
sci.med	 I remember hearing a few years back about a new therapy for hyperactivity which involved aggressively eliminating artificial coloring and flavoring from the diet. The theory -- which was backed up by interesting anecdotal results -- is that certain people are just way more sensitive to these chemicals than other people. I don't remember any connection being made with seizures, but it certainly couldn't hurt to try an all-natural diet. 
sci.med	 Phenylketonuria is a disease in which the body cannot process phenylalanine. It can build up in the blood and cause seizures and neurological damage. An odd side effect is that the urine can be deeply colored, like red wine. People with the condition must avoid Nutrasweet, chocolate, and anything else rich in phenylalanine. 
sci.med	 Serum, actually, but plasma numbers are the same. Whole blood numbers for humans tend to be somewhat lower (roughly 5 to 10 percent lower). I find the following range for whole blood in FUNDAMENTALS OF CLINICAL CHEMISTRY: N. W. Teitz, editor; W. B. Saunders, 1987: 
sci.med	 Many people responded with more anecdotal stories; I think its safe to say the original poster is already familiar with such stories. Presumably, he wants hard info to substantiate or refute claims about MSG making people ill. 
sci.med	 Nutrasweet is a synthetic sweetener a couple thousand times sweeter than sugar. Some people are concerned about the chemicals that the body produces when it degrades nutrasweet. It is thought to form formaldehyde and known to for methanol in the degredation pathway that the body uses to eliminate substances. The real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde produced are high enough to cause significant damage, as both are toxic to living cells. All I can say is that I will not consume it. 
sci.med	 Yeah, the "Feingold Diet" is a load of crap. Children diagnosed with ADD who are placed on this diet show no improvement in their intellectual and social skills, which in fact continue to decline. Of course, the parents who are enthusiastic about this approach lap it up at the expense of their children's development. So much for the value of "interesting anecdotal results". People will believe anything if they want to. 
sci.med	 Whether a scientific idea comes while one is staring out the window, or dreaming, or having a fantasy, or watching an apple fall (Newton), or sitting in a bath (Archimedes) ... it is ultimately the result of a lot of intense scientific thinking done beforehand. Letting one's mind roam freely and giving rein to one's intuition can be a useful way of coming up with new ideas, but only when one has done a lot of rational analysis of the problem first. 
sci.med	 My family doctor and the physiotherapist (PT) she sent me to agree that the pain in my left shoulder is bursitis. I have an appointment with an orthpod (I love that, it's short for 'orthopedic surgeon, apparently) but while I'm waiting the PT is treating me.

Getting published in these newsletters is hardly something to aspire to. :-) I can't really argue with your logic, though I think you may be extrapolating a bit recklessly from what appears to be a sample size of one. Even if what you say about this local Pittsburgh guy is true, it is not logical or fair to conclude that this is true of all doctors who treat Lyme disease. By your logic, I could conclude that all of the physicians who consult for insurance companies and make money by denying benefits to Lyme patients are doing it for the money, rather than because they believe they are encouraging good medicine. I have no idea how sincere these guys are, but their motives are as suspect as the physicians you excoriate for what you believe to be indiscriminate treatment. I would really feel more comfortable discussing the medical issues in Lyme, rather than speculating as to the motives of the various parties involved.

Also, I hope it can be used as an example and inspiration for the posting of other newsletters and data related to organ transplantation and donation. 
sci.med	 Aspartame is the methyl ester of a dipeptide, so a product of its hydrolysis is going to be methanol, which can then be oxidized to formaldehyde. The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of aspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise, since you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other components of food all the time. In studies involving administration of high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable. Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings, say 5ml and above. This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde and formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels can damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high doses the body's detoxification system is overwhelmed. Interestingly, one treatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on ethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent. That's because ethanol is metabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver. If the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde, it is actually relatively non-toxic. 
sci.med	 There has been NO hard info provided about MSG making people ill. That's the point, after all. 
sci.med	 Rutin is a bioflavonoid, compounds found (among other places) in the rinds of citrus fruits. These have been popular, especially in Europe, to treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases-- a few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he'd had hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills. Incredulously, I asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active ingredient. I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical sputtering. I have no idea how he's doing hemorrhoid-wise these days. The studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in human disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the reports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal. 
sci.med	 As a person who is very sensitive to msg and whose wife and kids are too, I WANT TO KNOW WHY THE FOOD INDUSTRY WANTS TO PUT MSG IN FOOD!!! 
sci.med	 Gee! Maybe I've misjudged you, Russell. Anyone who agrees with something I say can't be all bad. ;-) 
sci.med	 I looked for diab in my .newsrc and came up with nuthin. Anyone have any good sources for where I can read? In particular, I'm interested in finding out more about intravenous insulin injection for hepatic vein liver activation. (Whew! Wotta mouthful!) 
sci.med	 I recall that the issue is that fat on the meat liquifies and then drips down onto the hot elements--whatever they are--that the extreme heat then catalyzes something in the fat into one or more carcinogens which then are carried back up onto the meat in the smoke. 
sci.med	 This reminds me of the last Graham Kerr cooking show I saw. Today he smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot! He used a strange technique I'd never seen before. 
sci.med	 A brain abscess is an infection deep in the brain substance. It is hard to cure with antibiotics, since it gets walled off, and usually, it needs surgical drainage. 
sci.med	 Blood glucose levels of 40 or so are common several hours after a big meal. This level will usually not cause symptoms. 
sci.med	 ML From: libman@hsc.usc.edu (Marlena Libman) ML I need advice with a situation which occurred between me and a physican ML which upset me. 
sci.med	 Okay Mr. Dyer, we're properly impressed with your philosophical skills and ability to insult people. You're a wonderful speaker and an adept politician. However, I believe that all you were asked to do, was simply provide scientific research refuting the work of Olney. I don't think the original poster sought to start a philisophical debate. she wanted some information. Given a little effort one could justify that shooting oneself with a .45 before breakfast is a healthy practice. But we're not particularily interested in what you can verbally prove/disprove or rationalize. Where's the research? Where are the studies? 
sci.med	 Shouldn't have. But he may need to see the shrink about why he wanted to kill himself. Depressed people can be succesfully treated usually. 
sci.med	 Essential tremor is a progressive hereditary tremor that gets worse when the patient tries to use the effected member. All limbs, vocal cords, and head can be involved. Inderal is a beta-blocker and is usually effective in diminishing the tremor. Alcohol and mysoline are also effective, but alcohol is too toxic to use as a treatment. 
sci.med	 If I remember rightly PKU syndrome in infants is about 1/1200 ? They lack two genes. And people who lack one gene are supposed to be 1/56 persons? Those with PKU have to avoid naturally occuring phenylalanine. And those who only have one gene and underproduce whatever it is they are supposed to be producing are supposed to be less tolerant of aspartame. 
sci.med	 Probably because most of them come packaged with some absurd theory behind them. E.G. homoeopathy: like cures like. The more you dilute things, the more powerful they get, even if you dilute them so much there is no ingredient but water left. Chiropractic: all illness stems from compressions of nerves by misaligned vertebrae. Such systems are so patently absurd, that any good they do is accidental and not related to the theory. The only exception is probably herbalism, because scientists recognize the potent drugs that derive from plants and are always interested in seeing if they can find new plants that have active and useful substances. But that isn't what is meant by alternative medicine, usually. If you get into the Qi, accupuntunce charts, etc, you are now back to silly theories that probably have nothing to do with why accupuncture works in some cases. 
sci.med	 Your medical school library should have books on peripheral nerve injuries. Probably it was your brachial plexus, so look that up. 
sci.med	 The magnets are huge! Good MRI sets with big (1.5 Tesla) magnets cost millions of dollars. Then, the radiologist wants $400 for reading each scan. 
sci.med	 It's not a cycle. Free helium will escape from the atmosphere due to its high velocity. It won't be practical to recover it. It has to be mined.

sci.med	 I am looking for information on possible causes and long term effects of bone marrow sclerosis. I would also be thankful if anyone reading this newsgroup could list some recognized treatment centers if anything else than massive blood transfusion can be effective. If you plan on a "go to the library"-style reply, please be kind enough to add a list of suggested topics or readings: Medicine is not my field. 
sci.med	 Does anybody know of any information regarding the implementaion of total quality management, quality control, quality assurance in the delivery of health care service. I would appreciate any information. If there is enough interest, I will post the responses. Thank You Abhin Singla MS BioE, MBA, MD President AC Medcomp Inc 
sci.med	 This is in fact a hot topic in medicine these days, and much of the medical literature is devoted to this. The most heavily funded studies these days are for outcome research, and physicians (and others!) are constantly questionning whether what we do it truly effective in any given situation. QA activities are a routine part of every hospital's administrative function and are required by accreditation agencies. There are even entire publications devoted to QA issues. 
sci.med	 so as well. I Austria they do if you have a condition which can not be helped by "normal" medicine (happened to me). Switzerland seems to be the same as Austria (I have direct experience in the Swiss case).

sci.med	 Glutamate is not an essential amino acid. People can survive quite well without ever eating any. 
sci.med	 Experimental Lyme Disease in Dogs Produces Arthritis and Persistant Infection, The Journal of Infectious Diseases, March 1993, 167:651-664 
sci.med	 There is no contradiction here. It is essential in the sense that your body needs it. It is non-essential in the sense that your body can produce enough of it without supplement. 
sci.med	 And when you're in a technical discussion of amino acids, it's the latter definition that's used almost universally. 
sci.med	 From THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY GUIDE TO TOTAL NUTRITION: Stanley Gershoff, Ph.D., Dean of Tufts University School of Nutrition; HarperPerennial, 1991 (ISBN #0-06-272007-4):

sci.med	 I have a friend who has a very pronounced slouch of his upper back. He always walks and sits this way so I have concluded that he is hunchback. Is this a genetic disorder, or is it something that people can correct. i.e. is it just bad posture that can be changed with a bit of will power? 
sci.med	 KS From: keith@actrix.gen.nz (Keith Stewart) KSMy wife has become interested through an acquaintance in Post-Polio Syndrome KSThis apparently is not recognised in New Zealand and different symptons ( eg KSchest complaints) are treated separately. Does anone have any information 
sci.med	 DN From: nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu (David Nye) DN Briefly, this is a condition in which patients who have significant DN residual weakness from childhood polio notice progression of the DN weakness as they get older. One theory is that the remaining motor DN neurons have to work harder and so die sooner. 
sci.med	 I don't know anything specifically, but I have one further anecdote. A colleague of mine had a child with a serious congenital disease, tuberous sclerosis. Along with mental retardation comes a serious seizure disorder. The parents noticed that one thing that would precipitate a seizure was a meal with corn in it. I have always wondered about the connection, and further about other dietary ingredients that might precipitate seizures. Other experiences would be interesting to hear about from netters. 
sci.med	 Subject: Re: Eugenics (Gordon Banks) writes: 
sci.med	 To start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible. So there's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a given context. Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely and makes progress impossible. (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums of money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.) On the other hand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which eventually turn out to be false. There is a morass of studies contradicting other studies and outsiders start saying "You people call THIS science?" (My opinion, for what it's worth, is that one sees both these phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)

sci.med	 His _heart_? This jerk doesn't have a heart, and it beats me why you're apologizing for him. In my book, behavior like this is unprofessional, inexcusable, and beyond the pale. If he's overworked, it's because he's too busy raking in the bucks. More likely, he just likes to push women around. I'd fire the s.o.b., and get myself another doctor. 
sci.med	 I know that the placebo effect is where a patient feels better or even gets better because of his/her belief in the medicine and the doctor administering it. Is there also an anti-placebo effect where the patient dislikes/distrusts doctors and medicine and therefore doesn't get better or feel better in spite of the medicine? 
sci.med	 Hi, I am not sure where to post this message, please contact me if I'm way off the mark. On 19.3.93 my wife went to her General Practitioner (Doctor). He mentioned an article from a medical journal that is of great interest to us. He had read it in the previous three months but has been unable to find it again. The article was about Whiplash Injury/Cervical Pain. It mentions the use of a MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imagery) machine as a diagnostic tool and the work of a neurosurgeon who relived cervical pain. This article is most likely in an Australian medical journal. I very much want to obtain the name of the article, journal and author because the case matches my wife. We would very much appreciate anyone's help in this matter via email preferably. 
sci.med	 Just had the opportunity to watch this flick on A&E -- some 15 years since I saw it last. 
sci.med	 You may also want to buy a 'self injector' or something like that. My friend is diabetic. You load the hyperdermic, put it in a plastic case and set a spring to automatically push the needle into the skin and depress the plunger. 
sci.med	 Also, don't forget that it's better for your health to enjoy your steak than to resent your sprouts ... 
sci.med	 From my reading of the popular, and scientific, literature, I think that the benzopyrene-from-burned-fat problem is probably real but very small compared to other kinds of risks. (This type of problem also occurs with stove-top pan grilling.) One possible remedy I have read about is to take some vitamin C with your meal of barbecue (or bacon, e.g.). This MAY make sense because vit. C is an antioxidant which could counteract the adverse affect of some of the chemicals in question. Bon Apetit! 
sci.med	 Following a series of miscarriages, my wife was given a transfusion of my white cells. (The theory as I understand it is that there is some kind of immune blocking that prevents the body from attacking the pregnancy as it normally would a "foreign" body. Where this blocking is deficient, the body evicts the "intruder", resulting in a miscarriage. The white cells apparently enhance the blocking capability.) Following the transfusion, she successfully carried the next pregnancy to term, and Jake is now an active 9 month-old who cannot wait to walk. We're now thinking about having another child, but no one (including the OBGYN who supervised the first transfusion) really seems to know whether or not the transfusion process needs to be repeated for successive pregnancies. Is there anyone in net-land who has experience with this? Thanks...Gene (and Jane and Jake) 
sci.med	 I know that there is MSG sensitivity. When I eat foods with MSG I get very thirsty and my hands swell and get a terrible itchy rash. I first experienced this problem when I worked close to Chinatown and ate Chinese food almost everyday for lunch. Now I can't tolerate MSG at all. I can notice immediately when I have eaten any. I try to avoid MSG completely. 
sci.med	 For a brief, but pretty detailed account, try Hempel's _Philosophy of Natural Science_. 
sci.med	 My wife and I are in the process of selecting a pediatrician for our first child (due June 15th). We interviewed a young doctor last week and were very impressed with her. However, I discovered that she is actually not an Medical Doctor (M.D.) but rather a "Doctor of Osteopathy" (D.O.). What's the difference? I believe the pediatrician *I* went to for many years was a D.O. and he didn't seem different from any other doctor I've seen over the years. 
sci.med	 I don't understand the assumption that because something is found to be carcinogenic that "it would not be legal in the U.S.". I think that naturally occuring substances (excluding "controlled" substances) are pretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food, food additives or other "consumption". It's only when the chemists concoct (sp?) an ingredient that it falls under FDA regulations. Otherwise, if they really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything. How in the world do you suppose it's legal to "consume" tobacco products (which probably SHOULD be banned)? 
sci.med	 These effects are a very real concern in conducting studies of new treatments. Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by performing studies that are "blind" in various ways. Some of these are: 
sci.med	 There is eye dominance same as handedness (and usually for the same side). It has nothing to do with refractive error, however.

sci.med	 The FDA, I believe. Rules say no blood or blood products donations from anyone who has been in a malarial area for 3 years. I was a platelet donor until my Thailand trip and my blood bank was very disappointed to find out they couldn't use me for 3 years. 
sci.med	 You'd have to purify the river water first. I'm not sure how practical that is with the Mississippi. You'd better check with health agencies along the way to see if there are toxic chemicals in the river. If it is just microorganisms, those can be filtered or killed, but you may need activated charcoal or other means to purify from chemicals. Better be same than sorry. Obviously, drinking the river without processing it is likely to make you sick from bacteria and parasites. 
sci.med	 Is that true? I know some that won't even interview FMGs. Most programs discriminate, in that given an FMG equally qualified as an American they will take the American. What rights do they actually have? Does it matter if they are US citizens (most are not)? We have had good luck with FMGs and bad luck. SOme of our very best residents have been FMGs. Also, our very worst. As it turns out, the worst FMGs are often US citizens that studied in off-shore medical schools. Of the 5 residents fired for incompetence in the 12 years I've been here in my department, all have been FMGs. 3 were US citizens who studied in Guadalajara, 1 was a US citizen but was trained in the Soviet Union, and one was Philipina. Unfortunately, all are now practicing medicine somewhere, 3 of them in Neurology after having been picked up by other programs, 1 in psychiatry, and the other in emergency medicine. 
sci.med	 What causes those little brown spots on older people's hands? Are they called "liver spots" because they're sort of liver-colored, or do they indicate some actual liver dysfunction? 
sci.med	 A bit more than a year ago, a hernia in my right groin was discovered. It had produced a dull pain in that area. The hernia was repaired using the least intrusive (orthoscopic?) method and a "plug and patch". 
sci.med	 Someone I know has recently been diagnosed as having Candida Albicans, a disease about which I can find no information. Apparently it has something to do with the body's production of yeast while at the same time being highly allergic to yeast. Can anyone out there tell me any more about it? 
sci.med	 I recall reading/seeing that former baseball star Chris Chambliss' hitting abilities were (in part) attributed to a combination of left-handedness & right-eye dominance. 
sci.med	 There are even entire publications devoted to QA issues. 
sci.med	 I think that part of the problem is that I have proposed a definition of science that I intended to be interpreted broadly and that Lee Lady has interpreted fairly narrowly. My definition is this: Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous work. Lee Lady writes: 
sci.med	 I also heard this. I always thought it might make a good eposide of 'Columbo' for someone to be poisoned with heavy water - it wouldn't show up in any chemical test. 
sci.med	 I am very interested in investigations of starvation for improving health. I am the young Russian reseacher and have highest medical education and expierence in reseach work in biological field and would like to work on this problem.

Also I would like to set scientific contacts with colleagues who deals with investigations in this field. I would be very appreciated anyone reply me. 
sci.med	 Why don't you just look it up in the Merk? Or check out the medical dictionary cite which a doctor mentioned earlier in this thread? 
sci.med	 My 6 year son is so plagued. Lots of vaseline up his nose each night seems to keep it under control. But let him get bopped there, and he'll recur for days! Also allergies, colds, dry air all seem to contribute. But again, the vaseline, or A&D ointment, or neosporin all seem to keep them from recurring.

sci.med	 I think that's the correct spelling.. I am looking for any information/supplies that will allow do-it-yourselfers to take Krillean Pictures. I'm thinking that education suppliers for schools might have a appartus for sale, but I don't know any of the companies. Any info is greatly appreciated. In case you don't know, Krillean Photography, to the best of my knowledge, involves taking pictures of an (most of the time) organic object between charged plates. The picture will show energy patterns or spikes around the object photographed, and depending on what type of object it is, the spikes or energy patterns will vary. One might extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within the universe (as we know it) has its own energy signature. 
sci.med	 My comments about the Feingold Diet have no relevance to your daughter's purported FrostedFlakes-related seizures. I can't imagine why you included it. 
sci.med	 I have a long sighted eye and a short sighted eye. My right eye tends to cut out when I look at distant things, my left eye when I am close up. I had specs to balance things up a bit but could do without them. I thought that, one way or another, I would always be able to see clearly. Unfortunately middle age is rearing its ugly head and I can no longer see close up objects clearly. Maybe it's just that my arms are getting shorter :-) 
sci.med	 I have heard that epileptic patients go into seizures if they eat anything with MSG added. This may have something to do with the excitotoxicity of neurons.

sci.med	 As nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previous question "WHY DO YOU NEED TO PUT MSG IN ALMOST EVERY FOOD?" I must assume that my wife's answer is closer to the truth than I hoped it was. 
sci.med	 The proper spelling is Kirlian. It was an effect discoverd by S. Kirlian, a soviet film developer in 1939. 
sci.med	 I recently had a case of shingles and my doctors wanted to give me intravenous Acyclovir. 
sci.med	 This, simply stated, is a result of the bankrupt ethics in the healthcare and scientific medicine industries. 
sci.med	 Steve Dyer points out that Sharen was probably thinking of Sulfites. But the question still stands. 
sci.med	 I seem to recall that there was an article in Radio Electronics about this subject. In fact I have a copy of the article in front of me, but I can't find anywhere in the article a refrence as to what month it was in. The system they describe uses an automobile ignition coil for the high voltage. The article even includes some information on what kind of film to use and where to get it. 
sci.med	 This is also commonly seen in new teachers. The first few years, they're sick a lot, but gradually seem to build up immunities to almost everything common. Come to think of it, I was about my healthiest when I was working in a pathogens lab, exposed to who-knows-what all the time. Pre-OSHA, of course. 
sci.med	 I think some essential information must be missing here, i.e., you must be suffering from a condition which has caused immunosuppression. There is no indication for IV acyclovir for shingles in an otherwise healthy person. The oral form can help to reduce the length of symptoms, and may even help prevent the development of post-herpetic neuralgia, but I certainly would not subject someone to IV therapy without a good reason. 
sci.med	 No, there is something called the "Delany Amendment" which makes carcinogenic food additives illegal in any amount. This was passed by Congress in the 1950's, before stuff like mass spectrometry became available, which increased detectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude. 
sci.med	 I don't mean to be disrespectful to your concerns, but it seems to me that you're getting all wound up in a non-issue. 
sci.med	 I think it's safe to say that anything that's not at 0 degrees Kelvin will have its own "energy signature" -- the interesting questions are what kind of energy, and what it signifies. 
sci.med	 What exactly are knots, those sore, tight spots in your muscles? In certain kinds of massage, people try and break up these knots; it this really helpful? 
sci.med	 If you can get it, you might want to try a Canadian over-the-counter product called Secaris, which is a water-soluble gel. Compared to Vaseline or other greasy ointments, Secaris seems more compatible with the moisture that's already there. 
sci.med	 Frequently of late, I have been reacting to something added to restaurant foods. What happens is that the inside of my throat starts to feel "puffy", like I have a cold, and also at times the inside of my mouth (especially the tongue) and lips also feel puffy. 
sci.med	 I am sorry to once again bother those of you on this newsgroup.

Our three year old daughter suffers from this disease. Below is a press release that appeared in local newspapers. Hope you can join us. 
sci.med	 It would be nice to think that individuals can somehow 'beat the system' and like a space explorer, boldly go where no man has gone before and return with a prize cure. Unfortunately, too often the prize is limited and the efficacy of the 'cure' questionable when applied to all sufferers. 
sci.med	 It is not true that dermatologists gave not reached the laser age, in fact, lasers in dermatological surgery is a very new and exciting field. 
sci.med	 I was part of a study a few years ago at the University of Arizona to see whether cross dominant individuals (those with a particular handedness but who had dominance in the opposite eye) were better hitters than those with same side dominance of hand and eye. I was picked from my softball class because I was cross dominant (right hand, left eye) which put me in a small minority (and the grad student was trying to get an equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people). To control the study, she used a pitching machine - fast pitch. Since I was used to slow pitch, I didn't come close (actually I think I foul tipped a few) to hitting the ball. If there were a lot of people like me in her study (i.e., those who can't hit fast pitch, or are not used to hitting off a machine), I would seriously question the results of that study!! I think there have been some studies of major league players (across a fairly large cross section of players) to test whether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was "better" - but I don't know the results. (The woman who ran the study I was in said that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in major leaguers than across the general population - but I'm not sure whether I'd believe her.) 
sci.med	 This is the third and final call for votes for the creation of the newsgroup misc.health.diabetes.

Publishing your results could be a bit of a problem, though. 
sci.med	 MSG is common in many food we eat, including Chinese (though some oriental restaurants might put a tad too much in them). I've noticed that when I go out and eat in most of the Chinese food restaurants, I will usually get a slight headache and an ununsual thirst afterwards. This happens to many of my friends and relatives too. And, heh, we eat Chinese food all the time at home :) (but we don't use MSG when we're cooking for ourselves) 
sci.med	 Obesssive Compulsive Disorder (not to be confused with Obsessive Compulsive _Personality_ Disorder !) is an acute anxiety disorder characterized by either obsessions (persistent intrusive thoughts that cause anxiety when not entertained), or compulsions (repetitive, ritualistic actions that similarly cause intense psychological discomfort when resisted). 
sci.med	 As I understood it, MSG *is* natural. Isn't it found in" 'tomatoes? 
sci.med	 Does anyone know the approximate prescription cost of a 250 ml bottle of Roxonal (morphine)? 
sci.med	 The reason I'm posting this article to this newsgroup is to: 1. gather any information about this disorder from anyone who might have recently been *e*ffected by it ( from being associated with it or actually having this disorder ) and 2. help me find out where I can access any medical literature associated with seizures over the internet. 
sci.med	 There's a lot of evidence, it just hasn't been adequately gathered and published in a way that will convince the die-hard melancholic skeptics who quiver everytime the word 'anecdote' or 'empirical' is used. 
sci.med	 Does the Proventil inhaler for asthma relief fall into the steroid or nonsteroid category? Looking at the product literature it's not clear. 
sci.med	 I think what we have to keep in mind is that even though it may be illegal to commercially produce/sell food with carcinogenic substances, it is not illegal for people to do such to their own food (smoking, etc). Is this true? 
sci.med	 Can you provide a reference to substantiate that gaining back the lost weight does not constitute "weight rebound" until it exceeds the starting weight? Or is this oral tradition that is shared only among you obesity researchers? 
sci.med	 Why do you think he would be called a quack? The quacks don't do cultures. They poo-poo doing more lab tests: "this is Lyme, believe me, I've seen it many times. The lab tests aren't accurate. We'll treat it now." Also, is Dr. N's practice almost exclusively devoted to treating Lyme patients? I don't know *any* orthopedic surgeons who fit this pattern. They are usually GPs. 
sci.med	 Absolutely. Unfortunately, most of them have had 3 weeks of neurology in medical school and 1 month (maybe) in their residency. Most of that is done in the hospital where migraines rarely are seen. Where are they supposed to learn? Those who are diligent and read do learn, but most don't, unfortunately. 
sci.med	 It could be one of the leukodystrophies (not adrenal, only boys get that). Surely you've been to a university pediatric neurology department. If not that is the next step. Biopsies might help, especially if peripheral nerves are also affected. There are so many of these diseases that would fit the symptoms you gave that more can't be said at this time. 
sci.med	 Heat shock proteins are those whose expression is induced in response to elevated temperature. Some are also made when organisms are subjected to other stress conditions, e.g. high salt. They have no obvious connection to what happens when you burn proteins. 
sci.med	 My wife's ob-gyn has an ultrasound machine in her office. When the doctor couldn't hear a fetal heartbeat (13 weeks) she used the ultrasound to see if everything was ok. (it was) 
sci.med	 I have a lot of info about this disease. I am posting a small amount of it that I extracted. If more is required, e-mail me @ ls8139@gemini.albany.edu. Please, it takes me some time to upload it, so be advised, only request it if you *really* want it. 
sci.med	 Are you arguing that the Lyme lab test is accurate? The books that I've read say that in general the tests have a 50-50 chance of being correct. (The tests result in a large number of both false positives and false negatives. I am in the latter case.) 
sci.med	 Whoa. What did you say your name was? Address, SSN? Smoking foods, eh? I think the gov't would like to know about this... 
sci.med	 I recently attended an allery seminar. Steroid Nasal sprays were discussed. Afterward on a one-on-one basis, I asked the speaker what if none of the Vancanese, Beconase, Nasalide, Nasalcort, or Nasalchrom work nor do any oral decongestants work. She replied that she saw an article on Vasomotor Rhinitis. That this is not an allergic reaction and that nothing other than the Afrin's and such would work. (Which in my case is true). 
sci.med	 Does the Bates method work? I first heard about it in this newsgroup several years ago, and I have just got hold of a book, "How to improve your sight - simple daily drills in relaxation", by Margaret D. Corbett, ('Authorized instructor of the Bates method), published in 1953. It talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise. Has there been any study on whether this method actually works? If it works, is it by actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball, or by increasing the lens's ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the too-long eyeball? 
sci.med	 A friend's daughter has been diagnosed with an eye disease called "Star Gartds" (or something close) - it is apparently genetic, according to her, and affects every fourth generation. 
sci.med	 are seeing a pediatric neurologist, aren't you? If not, I strongly recommend it. There is a new anticonvulsant about to be released called felbamate which may be particularly helpful for infantile spasms. As for learning more about seizures, ask your doctor or his nurse about a local support group. 
sci.med	 A friend of mine is seeing an acupuncturist and wants to know if there is any danger of getting AIDS from the needles. 
sci.med	 I'm not sure there's a really sharp distinction between allergic and vasomotor rhinitis. Basically, vasomotor rhinitis means your nose is stuffy when it has no reason to be (not even an identifiable allergy). 
sci.med	 A relative of mine has recently been diagnosed with "stage 3 papillary cell ovarian cancer". We are urgently seeking the best place in the country for treatment for this. 
sci.med	 Hello, I am not sure if this is the right conference to ask this question, however, Here I go.. I am a commercial fisherman and I fell about 3 weeks ago down into the hold of the boat and broke or cracked a rib and wrenched and bruised my back and left arm. My question, I have been to a doctor and was told that it was best to do nothing and it would heal up with no long term effect, and indeed I am about 60 % better, however, the work I do is very hard and I am still not able to go back to work. The thing that worries me is the movement or "clunking" I feel and hear back there when I move certain ways... I heard some one talking about the rib they broke years ago and that it still bothers them.ÿ. any opinions? thanx and cheers 
sci.med	 Ask the practitioner whether he uses the pre-sterilized disposable needles, or if he reuses needles, sterilizing them between use. In the former case there's no conceivable way to get AIDS from the needles. In the latter case it's highly unlikely (though many practitioners use the disposable variety anyway). 
sci.med	 Can someone tell me whether or not any of the following medications has been linked to rapid/excessive weight gain and/or a distorted sense of taste or smell: Hismanal; Azmacort (a topical steroid to prevent asthma); Vancenase. 
sci.med	 Naomi, your best bet is to look in the Yellow Pages and find a listing for OBGyn doc in the area you wish. Any OBGyn doc is familiar with endometriosis and its treatments. Shalom Len Howard MD 
sci.med	 I have become involved in a project to further develop and improve the performance of SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography) imaging. We will eventually have to peddle this stuff somewhere, and so as I move this thing along, I would like to know -- 
sci.med	 I recently learned about these devices that supposedly induce specific brain wave frequencies in their users simply by wearing them. Mind machines consist of LED gogles, head phones, and a microprocessor that controls them. They strobe the (closed) eye and send sound pulses in sync with the flashing LEDs. I understand that these devices are experimental, but they are available. I've heard claims that they can induce sleep, and light trance states for relaxation. Essentially they are supposed to work without aid of drugs etc... I would think that if they work as reported they would be incredibly useful, The few sources I've seen are biased (they are selling the things, and a friend who has tried them claims that "every home should have one"). So do these mind machines (aka Light and Sound machines) work? can they induce alpha, theta, and/or delta waves in a person wearing them? What research if any has been done on them? Could they be used in lieu of a tranquilizer? Or are they just another bit of quackery? 
sci.med	 I don't know much and in fact, have asked questions here myself. My doctor told me that Paxil is a "cleaner" SRI in that it produces fewer side effects. As to a comparison between Zoloft and Prozac, I'm not able to remember what he said about the differences between those two drugs. Sorry 
sci.med	 I've recently listened to a tape by Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski, in which he claims to have discovered a series naturally occuring peptides with anti- cancer properties that he names antineoplastons. Burzynski says that his work has met with hostility in the United States, despite the favorable responses of his subjects during clinical trials. 
sci.med	 This is one of those sticky areas of medicine where battles frequently rage. With respect to your OB, I suspect that she has been certified in ultrasound diagnostics, and is thus allowed to use it and bill for its use. Many cardiologists also use ultrasound (echocardiography), and are in fact considered by many to be the 'experts'. I am not sure where OBs stand in this regard, but I suspect that they are at least as good as the radioligists (flame-retardant suit ready). 
sci.med	 I live at sea-level, and am called-upon to travel to high-altitude cities quite frequently, on business. The cities in question are at 7000 to 9000 feet of altitude. One of them especially is very polluted... 
sci.med	 There has been some recent research on vasomotor rhinitis that shows that ipratroprium bromide (Atrovent) inhaled nasally is an effective treatment for many sufferers. It has been approved for this use and is available with a nasal adaptor in Canada. In the US the FDA has yet to approve this use of the drug, but it is available as an oral inhaler (for COPD), and these can be adapted for intranasal use. 
sci.med	 I think he means Girlie Photography. A good place to find it is in non-descript little places that usually just say "Books" on the outside of the building in black and white. 
sci.med	 Dyer, you're rude. Medicine is not a totallly scientific endevour. It's often practiced in a disorganized manner. Most early treatment of non-life threatening illness is done on a guess, hazarded after anecdotal evidence given by the patient. It's an educated guess, by a trained person, but it's still no more than a guess. It's cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those people who don't respond. 
sci.med	 Hismanal (astemizole) is most definitely linked to weight gain. It really is peculiar that some antihistamines have this effect, and even more so an antihistamine like astemizole which purportedly doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier and so tends not to cause drowsiness. 
sci.med	 Both of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flushed face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular pulse. I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in the blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are sodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else, one can get too much of a good thing. 
sci.med	 A person posted certain stuff to this newsgroup, which were highly selected quotes stripped of their context. Here is the complete posting which was quoted (lacking the context of other postings in which it was made):

sci.med	 I am looking for current sources for lists of all the home medical tests currently legally available. I believe this trend of allowing tests at home where feasible, decreased medical costs by a factor of 10 or more and allows the patient some time and privacy to consider the best action from the results of such tests. In fact I believe home medical tests and certain basic tests for serious diseases such as cancer, heart disease, should be offered free to the American public. This could actually help to reduce national medical costs since many would have an earlier opportunity to know about and work toward recuperation or cure. Mike Romano 
sci.med	 JB JB Ron Roth recommends: "Once you have your hypoglycemia CONFIRMED through the JB proper channels, you might consider the following:..." JB [diet omitted] JB JB 1) Ron...what do YOU consider to be "proper channels"...this sounds suspiciously 
sci.med	 Your doctor is right. It is best to do nothing, besides taking some pain medication initially. Some patients don't like this and expect, or demand, to have something done. In these cases some physicians will "tape" the patient (put a lot of heavy adhesive tape around the chest), or prescribe an elastic binder. All this does is make it harder to breath, but the patient doesn't feel cheated, because soemthing is being done about the problem. Either way, the end results are the same. 
sci.med	 My girlfriend is in pain from kidney stones. She says that because she has no medical insurance, she cannot get them removed. 
sci.med	 Thanks to aldridge@netcom.com, I now know a bit more about Stargardt's disease, aka juvenile macular distrophy, but I would like to learn more. 
sci.med	 An apt description of the content of just about all ronroth's posts to date. At least there's entertainment value (though it is diminishing). 
sci.med	 I experienced a sudden numbness in my left arm this morning. Just after I completed my 4th set of deep squats. Today was my weight training day and I was just beginning my routine. All of a sudden at the end of the 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep. It was cold, turned pale, and lost 60% of its strength. The weight I used for squats wasn't that heavy, I was working hard but not at 100% effort. I waited for a few minutes, trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with chest exercises (flyes) with lighter dumbells than I normally use. But I dropped the left dumbell during the first set, and experienced continued arm weakness into the second. So I quit training and decided not to do my usual hour on the ski machine either. I'll take it easy for the rest of the day. 
sci.med	 What does a lack of taste of foods, or a sense of taste that seems "off" when eating foods in someone who has cancer mean? What are the possible causes of this? Why does it happen?

sci.med	 Yeah, yeah, yeah. I didn't threaten to rip your lips off, did I? Snort. 
sci.med	 I heard third-hand (not the best form of information) that there was recently published results of a study on Multiple-Personality-Disorder Syndrome patients revealing some interesting clues that the root cause of allergy may have a psychological trigger or basis. What I heard about this study was that in one 'personality', a MPDS patient exhibited no observable or clinical signs of inhalant allergy (scratch tests were used, according to what I heard), while in other personalities they showed obvious allergy symptoms, including testing a full ++++ on scratch tests for particular inhalants. 
sci.med	 Hmmm. These don't look like references to me. Is passive-aggressive behavior associated with weight rebound? :-) 
sci.med	 Years ago when I was an intern, an obese young woman was brought into the ER comatose after having been reported to have grand mal seizures why attending a "corn festival". We pumped her stomach and obtained what seemed like a couple of liters of corn, much of it intact kernals. After a few hours she woke up and was fine. I was tempted to sign her out as "acute corn intoxication." 
sci.med	 Morphine or demerol is about the only effective way of stopping pain that severe. Obviously, she'll need a prescription to get such drugs. Can't she go to the county hospital or something? 
sci.med	 someone wrote in expressing concern about getting AIDS from acupuncture needles..... 
sci.med	 If it were my wife, I would insist that a radiologist be involved in the process. Radiologist are intensively trained in the process of interpreting diagnostic imaging data and are aware of many things that other physicians aren't aware of. Would you want a radiologist to deliver your baby? If you wouldn't, then why would you want a OB/GYN to read your ultrasound study? 
sci.med	 For several years I have been dealing with reccurring corneal erosion. There does not seem to be much known about the cause of such a problem. My current episode is pretty bad since it is located in the middle of the cornea. If it's bad enough, the usual treatment for it is puncture therapy. However, my doctor this time is trying to let it heal by itself by putting a contact lens to protect the area. Apparently the problem is not that common, but I'd be curious if anyone else out there has a similar problem, perhaps to see if a cause can be found. 
sci.med	 A good source of information on Burzynski's method is in *The Cancer Industry* by pulitzer-prize nominee Ralph Moss. Also, a non-profit organization called "People Against Cancer," which was formed for the purpose of allowing cancer patients to access information regarding cancer therapies not endorsed by the cancer industry, but which have shown highly promising results (all of which are non-toxic).

sci.med	 One should be aware that foreign doctors admitted for training are ineligible to apply for resident alien status. In order to get the green card they have to return to their country and apply at the embassy there. Of course, many somehow get around this problem. Often it is by agreeing to practice in a town with a need and then the congressman from that district tacks a rider onto a bill saying "Dr. X will be allowed to have permanent residency in the US." A lot of bills in congress have such riders attached to them. Marrying a US citizen is the most common, although now they are even cracking down on that and trying to tell US citizens they must follow their spouse back to the Phillipines, or whereever.

sci.med	 Many of these cereals are corn-based. After your post I looked in the literature and located two articles that implicated corn (contains tryptophan) and seizures. The idea is that corn in the diet might potentiate an already existing or latent seizure disorder, not cause it. Check to see if the two Kellog cereals are corn based. I'd be interested. 
sci.med	 My girlfriend just started taking Imitrex for her migraine headaches. Her neurologist diagnosed her as having depression and suffering from rebound headaches due to daily doses of analgesics. She stopped taking all analgesics and caffine as of last Thursday (4/15). The weekend was pretty bad, but she made it through with the help of Imitrex about every 18 hours. Her third injection of Imitrex, during the worst of the withdrawl on Friday and six hours after the first of the day, left her very sick. Skin was flushed, sweating, vomiting and had severe headache pain. It subsided in an hour or so. Since then, she has been taking Imitrex as needed to control the pain. Immediately after taking it, she has increased head pain for ten minutes, dizziness and mild nausea and mild chest pains. A friend of hers mentioned that her doctor was wary of Imitrex because it had caused heart attacks in several people. Apparently the mild chest pains were common in these other people prior to there attacks. Is this just rumor? Has anyone else heard of these symptoms? My girlfriend also has Mitral Valve Prolapse. 
sci.med	 Funny about that... my wife (my girlfriend at the time) used to get sick after eating certain foods at various Asian restaurants, and never knew why. She'd go pale, and sweaty and then vomit copiously. A couple of us ventured a connection with MSG, and her response was: "MSG? What's that?". It also happened when she pigged out on some brands of savoury crackers and chips... which I noticed (later) had MSG on the label. Don't know about double blinds, but avoiding MSG has stopped her being sick at restaurants.

Aldous Huxley was one of the more "high profile" beleivers in his system. Mr. Huxley while giving a lecture on Bates system forgot the lecture that he was supposedely reading and had to put the paper right up to his eyes and then resorted to a magnifying glass from his pocket. book have been written debunking this technique, however they remain less read than the original fraud. cheers

They (World magazine) warned us all that it was very dangerous, probably to stop curious children from experimenting with it. Mind you, this was 10 years ago, at least.

sci.med	 There's been extensive discussion on the CompuServe Cancer Forum about Dr. Burzynski's treatment as a result of the decision of a forum member's father to undertake his treatment for brain glioblastoma. This disease is universally and usually rapidly fatal. After diagnosis in June 1992, the tumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy. The forum member checked extensively on Dr. Burzynki's track record for this disease. He spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from glioblastoma following this treatment and to an NCI oncologist who had audited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive. After the forum member's father began Dr. Burzynski's treatment in September, all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his oncologist in Chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of shrinkage or necrosis.

sci.med	 Living things maintain small electric fields to (1) enhance certain chemical reactions, (2) promote communication of states with in a cell, (3) communicate between cells (of which the nervous system is a specialized example), and perhaps other uses. These electric fields change with location and time in a large organism. Special photographic techniques such as applying external fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances caused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will be diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.

My doctor said it made him feel like he had to be DOING something all the time. But if you keep taking it, after a few weeks these symptoms seem to go away, he said hang in there. I did and they did. 
sci.med	 It is illegal to perform acupuncture with unsterilized needles. No licensed practitioner would dare do this. Also there is not a single documented case of transmission of AIDS via acupuncture needles. I wouldn't worry about it. 
sci.med	 A friend has what is apparently a fairly minor case of Crohn's disease. 
sci.med	 Speaking of which, has anyone else been impressed with how much the descriptions of neurasthenia published a century ago sound like CFS? 
sci.med	 Good story, Chuck, but it won't wash. I have read the NY Acad Sci one (and have it). This AM I couldn't find any reference to "weight rebound". I'm not saying it isn't there, but since you cited it, it is your responsibility to show me where it is in there. There is no index. I suspect you overstepped your knowledge base, as usual. 
sci.med	 Having been gone for 10 days, I'm way behind on my News reading, so many pardons if I am repeating something that has been said already. 
sci.med	 The following is from a critique of a "60 Minutes" presentation on MSG which was aired on November 3rd, 1991. The critique comes from THE TUFTS DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER, February 1992. [...edited for brevity...] 
sci.med	 You probably mean "RoHypnol", a member of the benzodiazepine family, chemical name is flunitrazepam. It is such a strong tranquilizer that it is probably best refered to as a hypnotic, rather than a tranquilizer. Just one pill will knock you on your ass. Side effects may be similar to valium, xanax, serax, librium and other benzodiazepines. 
sci.med	 Speaking as a physician who works in an urgent care center, the above behavior is completely inappropriate. If a patient who requires extensive care shows up at the last minute, we always see them and give them appropriate care. It is reasonable for a clinic to refuse to see patients outside of its posted hours, but what you describe is misbehavior. Ask to speak to the clinic director, and complain. Whatever their attitude, they have nothing to gain from angering patients. 
sci.med	 If she is having problems with fresh vegetables, the guess is that there is some obstruction of the intestine. Without knowing more it is not possible to say whether the obstruction is permanent due to scarring, or temporary due to swelling of inflammed intestine. In general, there are no dietary limitations in patients with Crohn's except as they relate to obstruction. There is no evidence that any foods will bring on recurrence of Crohn's. It is important to distinguish recurrence from recurrent symptoms. A physician would think of new inflammation as recurrence, while pains from raw veggies just imply a narrowing of the intestine. 
sci.med	 To construct a Kirlian device find a copy of _Handbook of Psychic Discoveries_ by Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schroeder 1975 Library of Congress 73-88532. It describes the necessary equipment and suppliers for the Tesla coil or alternatives, the copper plate and setup. I used a pack of SX-70 film and removed a single pack in a dark room, then made the exposure, put it back in the film pack and ran it out through the rollers of the camera forinstant developing and very high quality. It is a good way to experience what Kirlian Photography is really and what it is not. As you know all ready, it is the pattern in the bioplasmic energy fieldthat is significant. Variations caused by exposure time, distance from the plate, or pressure on the plate, or variations in the photo materials are not important. 
sci.med	 I can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed. Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci. Med. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did not exist. Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well. 
sci.med	 I was wondering if anyone had any information about Molluscous contagiosem. I acquired it, and fortunately got rid of it, but the question still lingers in my mind: Where did it come from? The little bit of info that I have received about it in the past states that it can be transmitted sexually, but also occurs in small children on the hands, feet and genitalia. 
sci.med	 has no medical insurance, she cannot get them removed. 
sci.med	 certainly not questioning Steve's claims, as for one I am not a doctor, and I agree that foods don't bring on the recurrence of Crohn's. But inflammation can be either mildly or DRASTICALLY enhanced due to food. 
sci.med	 I tried to e-mail you but it bounced back. Please e-mail me and I will give you someone's name who might be very helpful. You might also post your message to misc.kids. TAMARA sastls@mvs.sas.com 
sci.med	 Could you describe in more detail the above procedure? I've never heard about it. And yes, if they pierced you with the needles you probably should have protested. 
sci.med	 Melissa, there is a simpler procedure called a "Dorsal slit" that is really the first step of the usual circumcision. It is simpler and quicker, but the pain is about the same as circumcision after the anesthetic wears off and the aesthetic result post healing is not as good. See your friendly urologist for more details. Len Howard 
sci.med	 Dr Singla, you might contact Kaiser Health Plan either in the area closest to you or at the central office in Oakland CA. We have been doing QA, QoS, concurrent UR, and TQM for some time now in the Hawaii Region, and I suspect it is nationwide in the system. Len Howard MD 
sci.med	 Here is the tollfree hotline for the Epilepsy Foundation of America - 1-800-EFA-1000. They will be able to answer your questions and send you information and references on seizure types, medication, etc. They can also give you references for a pediatric neorologist in your area. Also ask for the number of your local Foundation who can put you in touch with a Parent Support Group and social workers. Good Luck. 
sci.med	 I had allergy shots for about four years starting as a sophomore in high school. Before that, I used to get bloody noses, nighttime asthma attacks, and eyes so itchy I couldn't get to sleep. After about 6 months on the shots, most of those symptoms were gone, and they haven't come back. I stopped getting the shots (due more to laziness than planning) in college. My allergies got a little worse after that, but are still nowhere near as bad as they used to be. So yes, the shots do work. 
sci.med	 Is it that serious? My EKG often comes back with a few irregular beats. Another question: Is a low blood potassium level very bad? My doctor seems concerned, but she tends to worry too much in general. 
sci.med	 I saw a Lifetime Medical Television show a few months back on travel medicine. It briefly mentioned some drugs which when started two or three days before getting to altitude could assist in acclimitazation. 
sci.med	 Steve, take a look at what you are saying. I don't see one construvtive word here. If you don't have anything constructive to add, why waste the bandwidth - yeah, sure, flame me for doing it myself. Is this categorically everything about everything. I'm not flaming your knowledge, just asking you to sit back and ask yourself "what if?" 
sci.med	 All your friend really has to do is find a Registered Dietician(RD). While most work in hospitals and clinics, many major cities will have RD's who are in "private practice" so to speak. Many physicans will refer their patients with Crohn's disease to RD's for dietary help. If you can get your friend's physician to make a referral, medical insurance should pay for the RD's services just like the services of a physical therapist. The better medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friend's plan doesn't, it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to control the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining heal. Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and lipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but I'm not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors. For bad inflammation, steroids are used but for a mild case, the side effects are not worth the small benefit gained by steroid use. Upjohn is developing a new lipoxygenase inhibitor that should greatly help deal with inflammatory diseases but it's not available yet. 
sci.med	 The best way of self injection is to use the right size needle and choose the correct spot. For Streptomycin, usually given intra muscularly, use a thin needle (23/24 guage) and select a spot on the upper, outer thigh (no major nerves or blood vessels there). Clean the area with antiseptic before injection, and after. Make sure to inject deeply (a different kind of pain is felt when the needle enters the muscle - contrasted to the 'prick' when it pierces the skin). 
sci.med	 GREAT post Martin. Very informative, well-balanced, and humanitarian without neglecting the need for scientific rigor. 
sci.med	 I tend to disagree- I think anecdotal evidence, provided there is a lot of it, and it is fairly consistent, will is very important. First, it points to the necessity of doing a study, and second, it at least says that the effects are all psychological (or possibly allergy in this case). As I've pointed out before, pyschological effects are no less real than other effects. One person's "make-believe" can easily be another person's reality. Using psychadelic drugs in a bizarre and twisted example, the hallucinations one person experiences on an acid trip cannot be guaranteed to another person on an acid trip- there is no clinical evidence that those effects are always going to happen. Anyhow, that was a pretty lame example, but hopefully I made my point- it's all a matter of perception, and as long as someone ingesting MSG perceives it as causing bad effects, then s/he can definitely experience those affects. On the other hand, it could just be an allergy to the food it's in, or something. Still, anecdotal evidence is not worthless- it's the stuff that leads to the study being done. -Dan 
sci.med	 Alexis Perry asked if low blood potassium could be dangerous. Yes. ZZ 
sci.med	 From article <1993Apr22.233001.13436@vax.oxford.ac.uk, by krishnas@vax.oxford.ac.uk: The best way of self injection is to use the right size needle and choose the correct spot.

sci.med	 It's on page 315, about 2 1/2 inches up from the bottom and an inch in from the right. 
sci.med	 For those of you interested in the above Procedure, I am able to add the following facts: 
sci.med	 Isn't there a relatively new treatment for kidney stones involving a non-invasive use of ultra-sound where the patient is lowered into some sort of liquid when he/she undergoes treatment? I'm sure I've read about it somewhere. If I remember it correctly it is a painless and effective treatment. A couple of weeks ago I visited a hospital here in Stockholm and saw big signs showing the way to the "Kidney stone chrusher" ... 
sci.med	 as being a "mistake"? It seems to me, that proponents of pseudo-sciences might have their own ideas of what constitutes a "mistake" and which discoveries of such previous mistakes they accept. 
sci.med	 Krillean photography involves taking pictures of minute decapods resident in the seas surrounding the antarctic. Or pictures taken by them, perhaps. 
sci.med	 I'm not sure of the exact recipe, but I'm sure acidophilus is one of the major ingredients. :-) 
sci.med	 Maybe, maybe not. A new graduate would obviously be well trained (but perhaps without sufficient experience). A radiologist trained 10 or 15 years ago who has not kept his continuing education current is a whole 'nuther matter. A OB who HAS trained in modern radiology technology is certainly more qualified than the latter and at least equal to the former. 
sci.med	 According to a previous poster, one should seek a doctor's assistance for injections. But what about Sumatriptin [sp?]? Doesn't one have to inject oneself immediately upon the onset of a migraine? 
sci.med	 If you do a MEDLINE search on "turmeric" you'll see that it is a potent lipoxygenase inhibitor which is being investigated in a number of areas. I'm in cardiology and about 4 years ago the cardiothoracic surgery lab at my hospital compared the effect of a teaspoon of dissolved turmeric vs. a $2000 bolus of tPA in preventing myocardial reperfusion injury in a perfused Langendorff sheep heart. The turmeric was more effective :-) 
sci.med	 I shot off a response to this last night that I've tried to cancel. It was only a few minutes later while driving home that I remembered that your message does specifically say cortical. My first reaction had been to suggest the PC12 pheochromocytoma line. That may still be a good compromise, depending on what you're doing. Have you concidered using a mouse cell line from one of the SV40 T antigen transgenic lines? Another alternative might be primary cells from bovine adrenal cortex. 
sci.med	 Summary of thread: A person has Crohns, raw vegetables cause problems (unspecified) Steve Holland replies: patient may have mild obstruction. Avoid things that would plug her up. Crohn's has no dietary restriction in general. 
sci.med	 Be sure a dietician is up to date on Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis. Previously, low residue diets were recommended, but this advice has now changed. Also, there will be differences in advice in patients with and without obstructuon remaining, so input by the physician will be important. I find the dietician very important in my practice, and I send most of my patients to a dietician in the course of seeing them, since dieticians know so much better how to get diet histories and evaluate the contents of a diet than I do. 
sci.med	 physician's personalities. Apologies to sci.med readers not familiar with the Myers-Briggs "NT/NF" personality terms. But, in a word or two, the NTs (iNtuitive-Thinkers) are approximately your philosophy/science/tech pragmatic types, and the NFs (iNtuitive-Feelers) are your humanities/social-"science"/theology idealistic types. They hate each others' guts (:-)) but tend to inter-marry. The letter "J" is a reference to conscienciousness/decisiveness.] 
sci.med	 But it is quite a leap in logic to observe one situation where anecdotal evidence led nowhere and therefore conclude that anecdotal evidence will NEVER lead anywhere. I'm sure somebody here can provide an example where anecdotal evidence (and the interpretation of it) was upheld/verified by follow-on rigorous clinical trials. 
sci.med	 I got asked in Sci. Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production( toxic, kidney stone formation?). I decided to post my answer here as well because of the recent question about kidney stones. Not long after I got into Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation. I'm going to state it again here. But the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6 supplements. Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys). 
sci.med	 The only recipies I've ever seen for this include plain yogurt, finely chopped cucumber and a couple of crushed cloves of garlic -- yummy. 
sci.med	 Hate to wreck your elaborate theory, but Steve Dyer is not an MD. So professional jealosy over doctors who help their patients with Nystatin, etc., can't very well come into the picture. Steve doesn't have any patients. 
sci.med	 I was there in 1976. I suppose it must have died out since 1946, then. Certainly I never heard of any homeopaths or herbalists in the employ of the NHS. Perhaps the law codified it but the authorities refused to hire any homeopaths. A similar law in the US allows chiropractors to practice in VA hospitals but I've never seen one there and I don't know of a single VA that has hired a chiropractor. There are a lot of Britons on the net, so someone should be able to tell us if the NHS provides homeopaths for you.

sci.med	 Also remember that most people map the sanguine/choleric/melencholic/phlegmatic division onto the extraversion and neuroticism dimensions (Like Eysenck) and that the MBTI does not deal with neuroticism (Costa & McCrae). 
sci.med	 The term arrhythmia is usually used to encompass a wide range of abnormal heart rhythms (cardiac dysrhythmias). Some of them are very serious while others are completely benign. Having "a few irregular beats" on an EKG could be serious depending on what those beats were and when they occurred, or could be of no significance. 
sci.med	 Do you believe that any quacks exist? How about quack diagnoses? Is being a "licensed physician" enough to guarantee that someone is not a quack, or is it just that even if a licensed physician is a quack, other people shouldn't say so? Can you give an example of a commonly diagnosed ailment that you think is a quack diagnosis, or have we gotten to the point in civilization where we no longer need to worry about unscrupulous "healers" taking advantage of people. 
sci.med	 I don't think they provide homeopaths, heck the heir apparent was trying to promote Osteopaths to the ranks of eligibility a couple of years back... It pleased my family no end, since I'm at an Osteopathic school, sort of validated it for them...then I told them that the name was the same but the practice was different....oh. If you're seeking validation for your philosophy on the strength of the national health service adopting it, I suggest that you are not very sure of the validity of your philosophy. I believe in 1946, the NHS was still having its nurses taught the fine art of "cupping", which is the vacuum extraction of intradermal fluids by means of heating a cup, placing it on the afflicted site and allowing it to cool. I wouldn't take my sick daughter to a homeopath. 
sci.med	 I can't answer most of your questions, but I've seen it happen in family members who are being treated with radiation and/or chemotherapy. Jory Graham published a cookbook many years ago (in cooperation with the American Cancer Society, I think) called "Something has to taste good" (as I recall). 
sci.med	 I hope Gordon Banks did not mean to imply that notions such as hard-to-see candida infections causing various problems should not be investigated. Many researchers have made breakthroughs by figuring out how to investigate things that were previously thought "virtually impossible to test for." 
sci.med	 One thing that I haven't seen in this thread is a discussion of the relation between IBD inflammation and the profile of ingested fatty acids (FAs). 
sci.med	 I have seen a fair bit of traffic recently concerning Epilepsy and seizures. I am also interested in this subject -- I have a son with Epilepsy and I am very active with the local association. I posted a message like this a few months ago and received no replies, but here it is again. 
sci.med	 Outbreaks of a chronic-mono-like entity were originally called EBS (or some variant thereof) because most of the people with this disease had elevated levels of antibodies to the EBV virus. But not all of them did, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal Medicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs. 
sci.med	 Ihave had a frozen shoulder for over a year or about a year. It is still partially frozen, and I am still in physical therapy every week. But the pain has subsided almost completely. UNTIL last week when I mowed the lawn for twenty minutes each, two days in a row. I have a push type power mower. The pain started back up a little bit for the first time in quite a while, and I used ice and medicine again. Can anybody explain why this particular activity, which does not seem to stress me very much generally, should cause this shoulder problem? 
sci.med	 I recall reading in the recently revised edition of the "Yeast Connection" that there is indeed work by researchers to do this. Of course, they are working on the theory that candida overbloom with penetration into mucus membrane tissue with associated "mild" inflammatory response can and does occur in a large number of people. If you reject this "yeast hypothesis", then I'd guess you'd view this research as one more wasteful and quixotic endeavor. Stay tuned. 
sci.med	 As you note, the research is mixed, so there is no consensus on the role of fatty acids in Ulcerative colitis. There is a role for short chain fatty acids in patients with colostomies and rectal pouches that are inflammed (Short is butyrate and shorter). There may be a role for treatment of UC with Short chain fatty acids, and I am looking forward to the upcoming AGA meeting in Boston to see what people are doing. 
sci.med	 Nobody is saying that you shouldn't be allowed to use msg. Just don't force it on others. If you have food that you want to enhance with msg just put the MSG on the table like salt. It is then the option of the eater to use it. If you make a commerical product, just leave it out. You can include a packet (like some salt packets) if you desire. 
sci.med	 I would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors (of the squeaky-clean, traditional crew-cut, talk to the AMA before starting any treatment, kind) who recommend treatments that, though "accepted", may not be necessary for the patient at the time. And all for making a quick buck. I would not be surprised if the cost of medical services in the U.S. is significantly inflated by these "quacks of a different color". In fact, I'd say these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question the true focus of the medical profession. The AMA and the Boards should focus on these "quacks" instead of devoting unbelievable energy on 'search-and- destroy-missions' to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non- traditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients that traditional/accepted medicine cannot help. 
sci.med	 It's plain yoghurt with grated cucumber and coriander (other spices are sometimes used). Some people use half yoghurt and half mayonaise. 
sci.med	 Yes, there is such a thing as eye dominance, although I am not sure if this dominance refers to perscription strength. 
sci.med	 I have been in the same boat as you last year. I've tried four times to send you an email response, but your end doesn't seem to accept my mail? Please let me know if you receive this. 
sci.med	 If you think you have kidney stones or your doctor tells you that you do, DEFINITELY follow up on it. My sister was diagnosed with kidney stones 1 1/2 years ago and given medication to take to dissolve them. After that failed and she continued to be in great pain, they decided she had endometriosis. When they did exploratory surgery, they discovered she had a tumor, which turned out to be rhabdomyosarcoma -- a very rare and agressive cancer. I realize this is not what happens in the majority of cases, but you never know what can happen and shouldn't take chances! 
sci.med	 Does anyone on this newsgroup happen to know WHY morphine was first isolated from opium? If you know why, or have an idea for where I could look to find this info, please mail me. CSH any suggestionas would be greatly appreciated

sci.space	 I have the "osculating elements at perigee" of an orbit, which I need to convert to something useful, preferably distance from the earth in evenly spaced time intervals. A GSM coordinate system is preferable, but I convert from other systems. C, pascal, or fortran code, or if you can point me to a book or something that'd be great. 
sci.space	 I hate to pour cold water on this, but currently seawater extracted uranium, even using the new, improved fiber absorbers from Japan, is about 20 times more expensive than uranium on the spot market. Uranium is *very* cheap right now, around $10/lb. Right now, there are mines closing because they can't compete with places like Cigar Lake in Canada (where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards to the mines, who work in shielded vehicles). Plenty of other sources (for example, uranium from phosphate processing) would come on line before uranium reached $200/lb. 
sci.space	 Dennis Replies; Now black when it is white is just white. Except that when black is called white money is put into the system in a study to find out just when it is justified to call black, white.

sci.space	 The supersonic booms hear a few months ago over I belive San Fran, heading east of what I heard, some new super speed Mach 25 aircraft?? What military based int he direction of flight are there that could handle a Mach 25aircraft on its landing decent?? Odd question?? 
sci.space	 Fabricating with reprocessed plutonium may result in something that may go kind of boom, but its hardly decent bomb grade plutonium. If you want bomb grade plutonium use a research reactor, not a power reactor. But if you want a bomb, don't use plutonium, use uranium. 
sci.space	 Unfortunately, things have been boding ill (is that a legitimate conjugation?) for a while. While the Office of Exploration had some great ideas, they never got much money. I've heard good things about Griffin, but it's hard to want him back in a job where he couldn't do anything. 
sci.space	 I had spacefood sticks just about every morning for breakfast in first and second grade (69-70, 70-71). They came in Chocolate, strawberry, and peanut butter and were cylinders about 10cm long and 1cm in diameter wrapped in yellow space foil (well, it seemed like space foil at the time). 
sci.space	 Can somebody elaborate on "Area Ruling". I gather it's something to do with aerodynamics of trans-sonic planes, and can be summarised as "Coke bottle good, Coke can bad". Anyone provide more details, derivation etc? 
sci.space	 Ooooh -- who would have thought that Galileo would get the chance to check out a comet TOO?!? 
sci.space	 Funny. A bit disturbing. Forging a posting seems somewhat unethical, even if the subject is as notorious as McElwaine. 
sci.space	 SSF is up for redesign again. Let's do it right this time! Let's step back and consider the functionality we want: 
sci.space	 No, instead you have stupid things like 3600 and 86400 and 31556925.9747 and 299792.458 and 9.80665 and ... 
sci.space	 I read it refered to as the "parabolic cross-section" rule; the idea was that if you plot the area of the fuselage cross- section as a function of the point fore-and-aft along the fuselage, a plot that is a **paraboloid** minimizes somethin' or 'nother (to be technical about it). 
sci.space	 They have a few problems. The biggest technical problem is the need to find two satellites going to the same rough orbit for a luanch. 
sci.space	 Actually, that is no longer true. In the last few years Congress has ammended laws to provide whatever is needed. Note that both Spacehab and Comet are funded this way. 
sci.space	 I remember those awful things. They were dry and crumbly, and I recall asking my third-grade teacher, Miss G'Francisco, how they kept the crumbs from floating around in zero-G. She had no clue. I have not seen anything like them in today's space program. 
sci.space	 American, perhaps, but nothing military about it. I learned (mostly) slugs when we talked English units in high school physics and while the teacher was an ex-Navy fighter jock the book certainly wasn't produced by the military. 
sci.space	 I note that you make no such case as you claim can be 'even more easily made'. Yes, the argument can (and has) been made that current government policy creates even larger market barriers than there were in the first place, but there is no such term as 'government failure', since the government can change policies whenever it pleases. The market doesn't do that and is governed by (relatively) well-understood forces. This libertopican bilge about 'moral arguments' about taxation, etc., is, at bottom, so much simplistic economic thinking. It can only be 'justified' by cliche derision of anyone who knows more about economics than the libertopian -- which is what invariably happens. Tripe a la Tommy, the new libertopian dish. 
sci.space	 Great speculation - I remember being proud on behalf of all the free world (you think that way when you are seven years old) that we had got there first. Now I'm almost sorry that it worked out that way. 
sci.space	 Well, pardon me for trying to continue the discussion rather than just tugging my forelock in dismay at having not considered actually trying to recover the energy from this process (which is at least trying to go the 'right' way on the energy curve). Now, where *did* I put those sackcloth and ashes? 
sci.space	 He also ignores a few other things. While organics would become significantly more expensive were all the oil to disappear (and thus some things would no longer be economically feasible), oil is hardly an irreplaceable resource any more than most other consumables. As supply decreases, prices rise and alternatives become more competetive. He also needs to consider that there has been an estimated 30 years of reserves pretty much as long as anyone has cared about petroleum; whatever the current usage rate is, we always seem to have about a 30 year reserve that we know about.

sci.space	 Comet Gehrels 3, which was discovered in 1977, was determined to have been in a temporary Jovian orbit from 1970 to 1973.

sci.space	 Hi Folks not exactly certain if this is the best place to ask, but I am searching for a summer internship in engineering. I will be graduating in early May with a B.S. in aerospace engineering and then pursuing my Masters this Fall .Does anyone know of anything that is available, I am in the process of applyi ng to some of the larger companies (ie. MacDac, Martin Marietta, Lockheed. If a nyone knows of anything I would appreciate it if you could mail it to me. 
sci.space	 Wasn't there a "plain" flavor too? They looked more like some kind of extruded industrial product than food -- perfectly smooth cylinders with perfectly smooth ends. Kinda scary. 
sci.space	 Ok, so how about the creation of oil producing bacteria? I figure that if you can make them to eat it up then you can make them to shit it. Any comments? 
sci.space	 A freeze dried Tootsie Roll (tm). The actual taste sensation was like nothing you will ever willingly experience. The amazing thing was that we ate a second one, and a third and .... 
sci.space	 Every aircraft has flight constraints for speed/AOA/power. When graphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft, presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft doesn't fall out of the sky. Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes 'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational) envelope'. 
sci.space	 Comet P/Helin-Roman-Crockett also spent some time as a temporary satellite to Jupiter a few years ago if you believe the calculations by Tancredi, G., Lindgren, M. and Rickman, H.(Astron. Astrophys., 239, pp. 375-380, 1990). 
sci.space	 I believe the reason is that the lung diaphram gets too tired to pump the liquid in and out and simply stops breathing after 2-3 minutes. So if your in the vehicle ready to go they better not put you on hold, or else!! That's about it. Remember a liquid is several more times as dense as a gas by its very nature. ~10 I think, depending on the gas and liquid comparision of course! 
sci.space	 The Apollo fire was harsh, A Saturn V explosion would have been hurtful but The Soviets winning would have been crushing. That could have been *the* technological turning point for the US turning us from Today's "We can do anything, we're *the* Super Power" to a much more reserved attitude like the Soviet Program today. 
sci.space	 Could you use some sort of mechanical chest compression as an aid. Sorta like the portable Iron Lung? Put some sort of flex tubing around the 'aquanauts' chest. Cyclically compress it and it will push enough on the chest wall to support breathing????? 
sci.space	 Everbody has been defining envelope. Why was the world "envelope" chosen, rather than say "shell", or "boundary". In analogy with the envelopes of airships perhaps? 
sci.space	 Ocean Reconnaissance Launch Surprises West Space News, April 5-11, 1993, p.2 [Excerpts] Russia launched its first ocean reconnaissance satellite in 26 months March 30, confounding Western analysts who had proclaimed the program dead. The Itar-TASS news agency announced the launch of Cosmos 2238 from Plesetsk Cosmodrome, but provided little description of the payload's mission. However, based on the satellite's trajectory, Western observers identified it as a military spacecraft designed to monitor electronic emissions from foreign naval ships in order to track their movement. Geoff Perry of the Kettering Group in England... [said] Western observers had concluded that no more would be launched. But days after the last [such] satellite re-entered the Earth's atmosphere, Cosmos 2238 was launched. 
sci.space	 What would all of you out there in net land think of the big 6 (Martin Mariatta, Boeing, Mcdonell Douglas, General Dynamics, Lockheed, Rockwell) getting together, and forming a consortium to study exactly what the market price pints are for building reusable launch vehicles, and spending say $3million to do that. Recognizing that most of the military requirements for launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere (say, has the shuttle ever really used that 1200mi crossrange capability? You get the idea, figure out how many, how often, where to, etc...) 
sci.space	 The following are my thoughts on a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly had with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays. We were there to discuss SSTO, and commercial space. This is how it went... 
sci.space	 Peanut butter was definitely my favorite. I don't think I ever took a second bite of the strawberry. 
sci.space	 Todays New York TImes just wrote about a pact being negotiated between us and the Russians to develope High Temperature Gas Cooled Fission Reactors using Re-Cycled Weapons Grade plutonium from Warhead stockpiles. THe fuel will be pelletized in ceramic for safety, and then after depletion will be sufficiently contaminated with by-products to make extraction of the remaining plutonium hazardous enough to deter re-use. 
sci.space	 The sightings were apparently spurious. There is no planet inside of the orbit of Mercury. 
sci.space	 How is it ever going to be an Off- the Shelf Technology if someone doesn't do it? Maybe we should do this as part of the SSF design goals. ;-) 
sci.space	 I am sure Mary or Henry can describe this more aptly then me. But here is how i understand it. 
sci.space	 You missed something. I think it takes off vertically and is intended to land the same way. 
sci.space	 I don't have to "try reading a bit", Pat. I *work* as a government contractor and know what the rules are like. Yes, they sign some (damned few -- which is why everyone is always having to go to Washington to see about next week's funding) multi-year contracts; they also aren't willing to include sufficient cancellation penalties when they *do* decide to cut the multi-year contract and not pay on it (which can happen arbitrarily at any time, no matter what previous plans were) to make the risk acceptable of something like putting up a private space station with the government as the expected prime occupant. 
sci.space	 If Comet Shoemaker-Levy 1993e is in Jovian orbit, and if the comet is still hanging around when Galileo arrives, then I'm sure it will be added to the list of targets. We'll have by then over two years of Earth-based observations to help narrow down the positions of the pieces of the comet. It probably won't be too much different than what was done with Gaspra. 
sci.space	 Sure. Why keep using oil? A hydrogen/electric economy would likely be cleaner and more efficient in the long run. The laws of supply and demand should get the transition underway before we reach a critical stage of shortage. 
sci.space	 NASA Headquarters distributed the following press release today (4/6). I've typed it in verbatim, for you folks to chew over. Many of the topics recently 
sci.space	 I attended a colloquium at Goddard last fall where the head of the operations section of NASA was talking about what future missions were going to be funded. I don't remember his name or title off hand and I have discarded the colloquia announcement. In any case, he was asked about that very matter: "Why can't we spend a few million more to keep instruments that we already have in place going?" 
sci.space	 The following press release was distributed April 1 by NASA Headquarters. 
sci.space	 They exist. Even photosynthetic varieties. Not economical at this time, though. 
sci.space	 The Japanese are still on the learning curve as far as nuclear power goes. This means that unlike the Germans (who do great things all by themselves) the Japanese tie up with foreign companies. The major one is Mitsubishi (who else) who have a sharing agreement with GE I think. No chance of a new design. 
sci.space	 Well they don't export anywhere near 50% of their GNP. Mexico's perhaps but not their own. They actually export around the 9-10% mark. Similar to most developed countries actually. Australia exports a larger share of GNP as does the United States (14% I think off hand. Always likely to be out by a factor of 12 or more though) This would be immediately obvious if you thought about it. 
sci.space	 I think you would lose your money. Julius was actually rather tall for a Roman. He did go on record as favouring small soldiers though. Thought they were tougher and had more guts. He was probably right if you think about it. As for Napoleon remember that the French avergae was just about 5 feet and that height is relative! Did he really have a complex? 
sci.space	 Allen Sherzer & Tim Kyger write: "Another problem is what are called 'wraps' (or sometimes the 'center tax'). When work for a large program like Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10 billion won't be spent on anything having anything to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the term 'center tax'. They look at the Station they are getting and the price they are paying and note that it doesn't add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware that a third of the money is going for something else." 
sci.space	 No, they fold on the dotted line. Look at pictures of carriers with loads of a/c on the deck, wings all neatly folded.

sci.space	 There was a Science fiction movie sometime ago (I do not remember its name) about a planet in the same orbit of Earth but hidden behind the Sun so it could never be visible from Earth. Turns out that that planet was the exact mirror image of Earth and all its inhabitants looked like the Earthings with the difference that their organs was in the opposite side like the heart was in the right side instead in the left and they would shake hands with the left hand and so on...

(These postings failed to appear for a while-- I wonder why?-- but they are now back.) 
sci.space	 Damn! So it was YOU who was drinking beer with ROBERT McELWANE in the PARKING LOT of the K-MART!

sci.space	 There has been something bothering me while watching NASA Select for a while. Well, I should'nt say bothering, maybe wondering would be better. When they are going to launch they say (sorry but I forget exactly who is saying what, OTC to PLT I think) "Clear caution & warning memory. Verify no unexpected errors. ...". I am wondering what an "expected error" might be. Sorry if this is a really dumb question, but inquiring minds just gotta know............ 
sci.space	 My poor old physics intuition will be very surprised if these tiny masses, sitting very close to Jupiter, play any role whatsoever in the problem. Or, to put it more technically, the extra "volume" they add to the phase space of possible capture trajectories is negligible.

sci.space	 I know people hate it when someone says somethings like "there was an article about that somewhere a while ago" but I'm going to say it anyway. I read an article on this subject, almost certainly in Space News, and something like six months ago. If anyone is really interested in the subject I can probably hunt it down given enough motivation.

Later, they went on to do more live-action SF series: *UFO* and *Space: 1999*.

sci.space	 Sigh. I try to make a little joke, I try to inject some humour here and what happens? In the immortal words of Foghorn Leghorn: 
sci.space	 pre-launch ops would qualify. Something like "Caution: SRBs have just been armed." 
sci.space	 I heard a similar statement in our local news (UTAH) tonight. They referred to the tool as "...the PLIERS that took a ride into space...". They also said that a Thiokol (sp?) employee had reported missing a tool of some kind during assembly of one SRB. No more info as to the location in the SRB. I agree, pretty weird. 
sci.space	 There was a recession, and none of the potential entrants could raise any money. The race organizers were actually supposed to be handling part of the fundraising, but the less said about that the better. 
sci.space	 Don't you think it would be better to E-mail back to you that we read sci.space so that you can count them and every server in the world does not have to get BW'd to death. Or instead you could possible cut and past all the senders into a single post and save on header bandwidth.... Not meaning to be taken as a flame it's late and we have to work toward a demo .... little punchy 
sci.space	 It still applies, except the astronomy these days is Very Long Baseline Radio Astronomy coupled to GPS and Satellite Laser Ranging. The data from NASA's and the Naval Observatory's (among others) is a vital source of data for studies into crustal dynamics, Earth rotation, and purturbations. Every time there is a leap second added to the New Year, remember the military and science are still co-habiting nicely. The same VLBI was used to track Gallileo as it passed the Earth, and used so little fuel that it can afford to observe Ida. 
sci.space	 Does anyone know how to size cold gas roll control thruster tanks for sounding rockets? 
sci.space	 The Apollo astronauts also trained at (in) Meteor Crater in the Flagstaff area (Arizona). There is now a museum with a space shop. Caution: they ease you by 6$. Compared to a KSC visit it's not worth. 
sci.space	 Well, first you work out how much cold gas you need, then make the tanks big enough. 
sci.space	 I was reading Popular Science this morning and was surprised by an ad in the back. I know that a lot of the ads in the back of PS are fringe science or questionablely legal, but this one really grabbed my attention. It was from a company name "Personal Missle, Inc." or something like that. 
sci.space	 Josh Hopkins (jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu) replied: : Wow. 
sci.space	 Afraid I can't give any more info on this.. and hoping someone in greter NETLAND has some details. 
sci.space	 The situation in this regard has changed considerably in recent years. See the discussion of "high-power rocketry" in the rec.models.rockets frequently-asked-questions list. 
sci.space	 I assume, then, that someone at Thiokol put on their "manager's hat" and said that pissing off the customer by delaying shipment of the SRB to look inside it was a bad idea, regardless of where that tool might have ended up.

sci.space	 Their Hiten engineering-test mission spent a while in a highly eccentric Earth orbit doing lunar flybys, and then was inserted into lunar orbit using some very tricky gravity-assist-like maneuvering. This meant that it would crash on the Moon eventually, since there is no such thing as a stable lunar orbit (as far as anyone knows), and I believe I recall hearing recently that it was about to happen. 
sci.space	 Let's see. These aren't, in a strict sense, amateur rockets. That term denotes rockets, the engines of which are constructed by the user. The rockets you describe are called HPR, or high power rockets, to distinguish them from (smaller) model rockets. They use factory-made ammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines with graphite nozzles. The engines are classified by impulse. A "D" engine, for example, can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse. An "F" engine can have no more than 40 ns. Each letter corresponds to a doubling of the maximum impulse. So far, engines up to size "O" are available pretty much off the shelf. Engines of size H and above are shipped as Class B explosives, and as such are controlled. Engines of size F and below are shipped as Class C explosives, and are not as controlled. Class F engines, BTW, are not HPR engines, but model rocket engines. (Class G engines go in and out of legal limbo.) 
sci.space	 Apologies if this gets posted twice, but I don't think the first one made it. 
sci.space	 Actually, they are legal! I not familiar with the ad you are speaking of but knowing Popular Science it is probably on the fringe. However, you may be speaking of "Public Missle, Inc.", which is a legitimate company that has been around for a while. 
sci.space	 Would the sub-orbital version be suitable as-is (or "as-will-be") for use as a reuseable sounding rocket? 
sci.space	 From another space forum NOW WHERE DID I LEAVE THOSE PLIERS? When workers at the Kennedy Space Center disassembled the STS-56 solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers lodged into the outside base of the right hand SRB. The tool survived the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot altitude, then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC. 
sci.space	 The Japanese spacecraft, Hiten, crashed on the Moon last weekend. For the past three years it has made several lunar flybys and even did some aerobraking experiments with Earth's atmosphere. It was placed in lunar orbit in February 1992, and I guess it finally ran out of fuel and was unable to maintain its orbit around the Moon. ___ _____ ___ /_ /| /____/ /_ /| Ron Baalke | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ /| | | | Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/ | | |__ M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | | ___/ | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/ |_|/ |_____|/ | part vegetable. 
sci.space	 The gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit 'fuzzy regions'. These are described by the inventor as exploiting the second-order perturbations in a three body system. The probe was launched into this region for the earth-moon-sun system, where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow down. The idea is that 'natural objects sometimes get captured without expending fuel, we'll just find the trajectory that makes it possible". The originator of the technique said that NASA wasn't interested, but that Japan was because their probe was small and couldn't hold a lot of fuel for deceleration. 
sci.space	 Background: The Orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept. It would be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft. The idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one to ten megatons yield behind a "pusher plate" attached to the main spacecraft. The shock wave from the explosions would transfer momentum to the ship. 
sci.space	 Actually, Hiten wasn't originally intended to go into lunar orbit at all, so it indeed didn't have much fuel on hand. The lunar-orbit mission was an afterthought, after Hagoromo (a tiny subsatellite deployed by Hiten during a lunar flyby) had a transmitter failure and its proper insertion into lunar orbit couldn't be positively confirmed. 
sci.space	 The Orion concept as actually proposed (as opposed to the way it has been somewhat misrepresented in some fiction) included wrapping a thick layer of reaction mass -- probably plastic of some sort -- around each bomb. The bomb vaporizes the reaction mass, and it's that which transfers momentum to the pusher plate. 
sci.space	 I thought that under emergency conditions, the STS can put down at any good size Airport. IF it could take a C-5 or a 747, then it can take an orbiter. You just need a VOR/TAC 
sci.space	 Now, I had put a Wink at the end of my suggestion indicating it was intensely sarcastic. I can't help it if everyone got all serious. 
sci.space	 Is it right??? That is new stuff for me. So it means that you just can not put a sattellite around around the Moon for too long because its orbit will be unstable??? If so, what is the reason??? Is that because the combined gravitacional atraction of the Sun,Moon and Earth that does not provide a stable orbit around the Moon??? 
sci.space	 Portuguese launch complex??? Gosh.... Polish are for American in the same way as Portuguese are for Brazilians (I am from Brazil). There is a joke about the Portuguese Space Agency that wanted to send a Portuguese astronaut to the surface of the Sun (if there is such a thing). How did they solve all problems of sending a man to the surface of the Sun??? Simple... their astronauts travelled during the night... 
sci.space	 Is this the one that had the {wrench|pliers} found inside after recovery? 
sci.space	 I have attached a copy of an announcement I picked up during my trip to Moscow last week. I have several friends at the Moscow Aviation Institute who have asked me to post this announcement. (I have done some editing, but the contents is unchanged from the original announcement.) 
sci.space	 An excellent reference for non-technical readers on the ORION system is "The Starflight Handbook", by Eugene Mallove and Gregory Matloff, ISBN 0-471-61912-4. The relevant chapter is 4: Nuclear Pulse Propulsion. 
sci.space	 I should probably re-post this with another title, so that the guys on the other thread would see that this is a practical use of "temporary orbits..." 
sci.space	 Any lunar satellite needs fuel to do regular orbit corrections, and when its fuel runs out it will crash within months. The orbits of the Apollo motherships changed noticeably during lunar missions lasting only a few days. It is *possible* that there are stable orbits here and there -- the Moon's gravitational field is poorly mapped -- but we know of none.

Solid motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of aluminum in the mix. For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent Aluminum. The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure. The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect some bubbling process is used to form it). In other words, if you made a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what you get. It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in all directions. The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into the voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant. The foamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant, so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain. The major improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the principal failure mode for solid propellant. 
sci.space	 Okay, lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun. The project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for the Laser group at Livermore. What, you may ask, does gas guns have to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically located across the road from the Free Electron Laser building, and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls) from which the gun firings are controlled. So I suspect that the office he works for is an administrative convenience. 
sci.space	 ERL-1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive strength of 280,000 psi. It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in, therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column that can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft, or 75 Statute miles. 
sci.space	 There is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today's LA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1). I thought I'd post it to stir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate. Let me preface it by saying that I largely agree that the "Space Age" in the romantic sense of several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station miss the point at this time. Reading, for example, "What's New" - the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that the romance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of matter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things people are doing with individual atoms these days. To a large extent, I think, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of nostalgia. I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our "mind children" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but I think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about what we can do *now*. 
sci.space	 It was more than a theoretical concept; it was seriously pursued by Freeman Dyson et al many years ago. I don't know how well-known this is, but a high explosive Orion prototype flew (in the atmosphere) in San Diego back in 1957 or 1958. I was working at General Atomic at the time, but I didn't learn about the experiment until almost thirty years later, when Ted Taylor visited us and revealed that it had been done. I feel sure that someone must have film of that experiment, and I'd really like to see it. Has anyone out there seen it? 
sci.space	 I am a newbie to the net, and I am trying to get some information for a paper I am working on to get back into college. If anyone can send me data on Solar coronal holes and recurrant aurora for the past thirty years it would be a big help. Or, if you have information on more esoteric things like Telluric current, surge bafflers power companies use, or other effects sporatic aurora have on the Earth's magnetic field, I'd be eternally gratefull. Please send anything interesting to me at Marty Crandall-Grela Van Vleck Observatory Wesleyan University Middletown,Ct 06487 or e-mail it to me at mcrandall@eagle.wesleyan.edu Thank-you in advance, Marty 
sci.space	 I know someone had long talks about Solar Sails early this year and late last year..Also about Solar Sailing. Not sure who captured it if possible.. 
sci.space	 Does anyone have any Russian Contacts (Space or other) or contacts in the old USSR/SU or Eastern Europe? 
sci.space	 The difficulties of a high Isp OTV include: Long transfer times (radiation damage from VanAllen belts for both the spacecraft and OTV Arcjets or Xenon thrusters require huge amounts of power so you have to have either nuclear power source (messy, dangerous and source of radiation damage) or BIG solar arrays (sensitive to radiation, or heavy) that make attitude control and docking a big pain. 
sci.space	 Is anybody out there willing to discuss with me careers in the Army that deal with space? After I graduate, I will have a commitment to serve in the Army, and I would like to spend it in a space-related field. I saw a post a long time ago about the Air Force Space Command which made a fleeting reference to its Army counter-part. Any more info on that would be appreciated. I'm looking for things like: do I branch Intelligence, or Signal, or other? To whom do I voice my interest in space? What qualifications are necessary? Etc, etc. BTW, my major is computer science engineering. 
sci.space	 Nope, I haven't seen the film, but Taylor's biography ("The Curve of Binding Energy") contains a short section on Orion and this test flight. Apparently it was quite impressi, and got von Braun very excited. 
sci.space	 There is a guy in NASA Johnson Space Center that might answer your question. I do not have his name right now but if you follow up I can dig that out for you. 
sci.space	 We are not at the end of the Space Age, but only at the end of Its beginning. 
sci.space	 This is turning into 'what's a moonbase good for', and I ought not to post when I've a hundred some odd posts to go, but I would think that the real reason to have a moon base is economic. 
sci.space	 Kerry-- I'm guessing a little at this, because it's been a few years since I saw the info, but you will probably want to look at Air Defense Artillery as a specialty, or possibly Signals. The kind of thing you're looking for is SDI-type assignments, but it'll be pretty prosaic stuff. Things like hard-kill ATBM missiles, some of the COBRA rigs -- that kind of thing. 
sci.space	 I don't care who told you this it is not generally true. I see EVERY single line item on a contract and I have to sign it. There is no such thing as wrap at this university. I also asked around here. Ther is no wrap at Marquette, University of Wisconsin Madison, Utah State, Weber State or Embry Riddle U. I am not saying that it doees not happen but in every instance that I have been able to track down it does not. Also the president of our University who was Provost at University of West Virgina said that it did not happen there either and that this figure must be included in the overhead to be a legitimate charge. 
sci.space	 Oddly, enough, The smithsonian calls the lindbergh years the golden age of flight. I would call it the granite years, reflecting the primitive nature of it. It was romantic, swashbuckling daredevils, "those daring young men in their flying machines". But in reality, it sucked. Death was a highly likely occurence, and the environment blew. Ever see the early navy pressure suits, they were modified diving suits. You were ready to star in "plan 9 from outer space". Radios and Nav AIds were a joke, and engines ran on castor oil. They picked and called aviators "men with iron stomachs", and it wasn't due to vertigo. 
sci.space	 For an essay, I am writing about the space shuttle and a need for a better propulsion system. Through research, I have found that it is rather clumsy (i.e. all the checks/tests before launch), the safety hazards ("sitting on a hydrogen bomb"), etc.. If you have any beefs about the current space shuttle program Re: propulsion, please send me your ideas. 
sci.space	 The National Air & Space Museum has both the prototype and the film. When I was there, some years ago, they had the prototype on display and the film continuously repeating. 
sci.space	 You're assuming that "go solar" = "photovoltaic". Solar dynamic power (turbo-alternators) doesn't have this problem. It also has rather less air drag due to its higher efficiency, which is a non-trivial win for big solar plants at low altitude. 
sci.space	 Exactly when will the hover test be done, and will any of the TV networks carry it. I really want to see that... 
sci.space	 Great! I'll visit the National Air and Space Museum at the end of the month with my wife, who was also working at General Atomic at the time. Once again netnews has enriched my life. 
sci.space	 Dennis, I have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions of $$. Customers included government (including NASA), for profit and non-profit companies. All expected a wrap (usually called a fee). Much of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors. The subcontractors where universities, for-profits, non-profits, and even some of the NASA Centers for the Commercialization of Space. ALL charged fees as part of the work. Down the street is one of the NASA commercialization centers; they charge a fee. 
sci.space	 Many of you at this point have seen a copy of the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act by now. This bill, also known as the Back to the Moon bill, would authorize the U.S. government to purchase lunar science data from private and non-profit vendors, selected on the basis of competitive bidding, with an aggregate cap on bid awards of $65 million. If you have a copy of the bill, and can't or don't want to go through all of the legalese contained in all Federal legislation,don't both - you have a free resource to evaluate the bill for you. Your local congressional office, listed in the phone book,is staffed by people who can forward a copy of the bill to legal experts. Simply ask them to do so, and to consider supporting the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act. If you do get feedback, negative or positive, from your congressional office, please forward it to: David Anderman 3136 E. Yorba Linda Blvd., Apt G-14, Fullerton, CA 92631, or via E-Mail to: David.Anderman@ofa123.fidonet.org. Another resource is your local chapter of the National Space Society. Members of the chapter will be happy to work with you to evaluate and support the Back to the Moon bill. For the address and telephone number of the nearest chapter to you, please send E-mail, or check the latest issue of Ad Astra, in a library near you. Finally, if you have requested, and not received, information about the Back to the Moon bill, please re-send your request. The database for the bill was recently corrupted, and some information was lost. The authors of the bill thank you for your patience. 
sci.space	 I might suggest giving the management some more mumble time by asking the very leading question (in two or three parts) What are your long term expectations of space market, what projects specifically are they funding by internal funds and at what levels and what competition do you expect in this area. (This last point is always worth hitting upper management with "gently" if you want them to think and as hard as you can if you have a good case that there really is competion) 
sci.space	 I doubt there are good prospects for a self armoring system for venus surface conditions (several hundred degrees, very high pressure of CO2, possibly sulfuric and nitric acids or oxides but it is a notion to consider for outer planets rs where you might pick up ices under less extream upper atmosphere conditions buying deeper penetration. A nice creative idea, unlikly but worthy of thinking about. 
sci.space	 I found it very interesting that Atlas depended on pressure to maintain tank geometry....leads me to the question: ? have any of the SSTO concepts explored pressurized tankage such that the launch configuration would be significantly different from the reentry one? I have long been facinated by pnumatic structures as conceived and built by Frei Otto and others, a "ballon" tank SSTO sounds very clever. 
sci.space	 If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo, but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than just a "we have the money, why not?" approach. 
sci.space	 Last I had heard because of budget and such the Air Farce is the only "Space Command" left.. The rest missions were generally given to the Air Farce.. 
sci.space	 Is the film from the "putt-putt" test vehicle which used conventional explosives as a proof-of-concept test, or another one? 
sci.space	 If you are really interested in these orbits and how they are obtained you should try and find the following paper: 
sci.space	 From article <C5owCB.n3p@world.std.com, by tombaker@world.std.com (Tom A Baker): In article <C5JLwx.4H9.1@cs.cmu.edu, ETRAT@ttacs1.ttu.edu (Pack Rat) writes... "Clear caution & warning memory. Verify no unexpected errors. ...". I am wondering what an "expected error" might be. Sorry if this is a really dumb question, but 
sci.space	 I have before me a pertinent report from the United States General Accounting Office: 
sci.space	 Wow. I was beginning to think that I had made that up. I remember that movie (it was about 1.5 hours long). I don't think they ended up anywhere in the known universe. 
sci.space	 With the continuin talk about the "End of the Space Age" and complaints by government over the large cost, why not try something I read about that might just work. 
sci.space	 I've seen a film of it, my memory may be faulty, but as I remember it the vehicle was slightly over a meter long, with a thick baseplate 30-40 cm in diameter. I think the narrative said it was propelled by dynamite sticks. There were four detonations within about 2 s, the second coming after about 2 m of flight in. Max altitude seemed to be on the order of 50 m, but that is hard to judge. 
sci.space	 But with cheaper fuel from space based sources it will be cheaper to reach more orbits than from the ground. 
sci.space	 You totally forgot the original post that you posted Allen. In that post you stated that the "wrap" was on top of and in addition to any overhead. Geez in this post you finally admit that this is not true. 
sci.space	 Bingo. B2 is not bench science, but rather a large scale attempt to re-create a series of micro-ecologies. what's so eveil about this? Nothing evil at all. There's no actual harm in what they're doing, only how they represent it. 
sci.space	 I think I can. Largely as a result of efforts by people reading this group writing letters and making phone calls the following has happened: 
sci.space	 There are several star map programs available. Your job is to choose that you like. Try anonymous-FTP from: 
sci.space	 If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo, but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than just a "we have the money, why not?" approach. 
sci.space	 My understanding is that the 'expected errors' are basically known bugs in the warning system software - things are checked that don't have the right values in yet because they aren't set till after launch, and suchlike. Rather than fix the code and possibly introduce new bugs, they just tell the crew 'ok, if you see a warning no. 213 before liftoff, ignore it'. 
sci.space	 I'm an advocate of this idea for funding Space Station work, and I throw around the $1 billion figure for that "reward." I suggest that you increase the Lunar reward to about $3 billion. 
sci.space	 Sorry to put a damper on your plans, but I was there three weeks ago and it wasn't there. Not that I would have known to look for it, of course, but I combed the space exhibits pretty thoroughly and something like that would have caught my attention instantly. 
sci.space	 zillion lines in response to article <1993Apr18.034101.21934@iti.org, in which Allen wrote a zillion lines in response to article <17APR199316423628@judy.uh.edu, in which Dennis wrote another zillion lines in response to Allen. 
sci.space	 It wasn't especially prominent, as I recall. However, quite possibly it's no longer on display; NASM, like most museums, has much more stuff than it can display at once, and does rotate the displays occasionally. 
sci.space	 AW&ST had a brief blurb on a Manned Lunar Exploration confernce May 7th at Crystal City Virginia, under the auspices of AIAA. 
sci.space	 When I first saw this, I thought for a second that it was a headline from The Star about the pliers found in the SRB recently. 
sci.space	 I am posting this for a friend without internet access. Please inquire to the phone number and address listed. 
sci.space	 I have received my copies of Cosmonautics 1990 and Cosmonautics 1991, as well as Soviet Space 1990 and Space Station [MIR] Handbook from Aerospace Ambassadors with no problem.

sci.space	 If that were true, I'd go for it.. I have a few friends who we could pool our resources and do it.. Maybe make it a prize kind of liek the "Solar Car Race" in Australia.. Anybody game for a contest! 
sci.space	 Also would maybe get the Russians Involved. After all they do have the resources to do it in part.. But they need the capital and the goal.. 
sci.space	 I got something in the mail from AIAA about it. Cost is $75. Speakers include John Pike, Hohn Young, and Ian Pryke. 
sci.space	 Here are some selected excerpts of the invitation/registration form they sent me. Retyped without permission, all typo's are mine. 
sci.space	 Just a pointer to the article in the current Science News article on Federal R&D funding. 
sci.space	 Oh gee, a billion dollars! That'd be just about enough to cover the cost of the feasability study! Happy, Happy, JOY! JOY! 
sci.space	 Well, we got some responses and are doing some interviews with interesting responders. However, just in case the other posting was overlooked by an incredibly talented person ... Mea Culpa for posting this here for Mike, but we're looking for someone special: 
sci.space	 Thanks for typing that in, Steven. Sounds like a "fall back and regroup" strategy session. 
sci.space	 I gues it is Keesler. The others do not ring the bell but they might be involved as well. Sometime ago Keesler was here at Langley teaching a course on space debris and, if my memory does not fai,l I think there was even a reference to a book on the subject. 
sci.space	 Well, first you work out how much cold gas you need, then make the tanks big enough. 
sci.space	 Can anyone tell me where I might find stereo images of planetary and planetary satellite surfaces? GIFs preferred, but any will do. I'm especially interested in stereos of the surfaces of Phobos, Deimos, Mars and the Moon (in that order). Thanks. 
sci.space	 Announce that a reward of $1 billion would go to the first corporation who successfully keeps at least 1 person alive on the moon for a year. 
sci.space	 A good summary has been posted (thanks), but I wanted to add another comment. I remeber reading the comment that General Dynamics was tied into this, in connection with their proposal for an early manned landing. Sorry I don't rember where I heard this, but I'm fairly sure it was somewhere reputable. Anyone else know anything on this angle? 
sci.space	 Never said you didn't publish, merely that there is data you don't publish, and that no-one scoriates you for those cases. 
sci.space	 Hey! My dad has an old hangar and Judy has some old rockets in her attic, let's put on a Lunar program! . . . Sounds good, but . . . Let's play a game - What would be a reasonable reward? What companies would have a reasonable shot at pulling off such a feat? Just where in the budget would the reward come from? Should there be a time limit? Would a straight cash money award be enough or should we throw in say . . . exclusive mining rights for the first fifty years? You get the idea. 
sci.space	 Every time you read about a shuttle landing they mention the double sonic booms. Having taken various relevant classes, I have several ideas of where they come from, but none of them are very convincing. Exactly what causes them? Are they a one time pheneomenon, or a constant one like the supersonic shockwave that is constantly produced by a plane, but you hear only when it goes over you? 
sci.space	 A cash award is OK. A time limit would be nice. You can't give away mining rights (assuming there's anything to mine) because you don't own them. 
sci.space	 Depends. If you assume the existance of a working SSTO like DC, on billion $$ would be enough to put about a quarter million pounds of stuff on the moon. If some of that mass went to send equipment to make LOX for the transfer vehicle, you could send a lot more. Either way, its a lot more than needed. 
sci.space	 I think if there is to be a prize and such.. There should be "classes" such as the following: 
sci.space	 I think Mark was talking about making it available to people who didn't have email in the first place.

Since someone with space industry will presumeably have a much larger GNP than they would _without_ space industry, eventually, they will simply be able to afford more stuff. 
sci.space	 DC-X as is today isn't suitable for this. However, the followon SDIO funds will. A reusable sounding rocket was always SDIO's goal. 
sci.space	 I saw in the newspaper last night that Dr. Mae Jemison, the first black woman in space (she's a physician and chemical engineer who flew on Endeavour last year) will appear as a transporter operator on the "Star Trek: The Next Generation" episode that airs the week of May 31. It's hardly space science, I know, but it's interesting.

sci.space	 The gravity data is collected in real-time and it not recorded to the tape recorder. However, you only need to collect the gravity every 3rd or 4th orbit, so there is no real data loss if the Moon blocks transmission for a short while.

sci.space	 yeah,' "this isn't my real name, I'm a bald headed space baby. 
sci.space	 I was at an interesting seminar at work (UK's R.A.L. Space Science Dept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail proposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to generate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at the meeting. Here goes : 
sci.space	 Actually, there are people who will tell you that it *would* be enough to do SSTO development, if done privately as a cut-rate operation. Of course, they may be over-optimistic. 
sci.space	 I would like to find out about space engineering employment and educational opportunities in the Tucson, Arizona area. E-mail responses appreciated. My mail feed is intermittent, so please try one or all of these addresses. 
sci.space	 Wishful thinking mostly. It's more likely that the Moon will never be the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no materials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids and comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low grade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, and it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat sink capacity could offer some military utility for "high ground" military weapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that's a very minor activity in the global scope of things. 
sci.space	 Actually I favor government funded research. It *is* a pump prime for a lot of basic technologies. I also understand the short term value of high tech welfare programs. But they can't substitute for long range wealth generation via commercial enterprise. That's what's needed to maintain a healthy economy *anywhere*, on Earth or Luna. I don't see that long term potential on Luna due to a bunch of factors I outline in another post. 
sci.space	 At one time there was speculation that the first spacewalk (Alexei Leonov ?) was a staged fake. 
sci.space	 Nick Haines sez; (given that I've heard the Shuttle software rated as Level 5 in maturity, I strongly doubt that this [having lots of bugs] is the case). 
sci.space	 The NASM photo archives are open to the public. All (or almost all) still pictures in the collection are available for viewing, but I don't know about films. At least it might be worth a try. I'm not sure if appointments are necessary, but I think not. 
sci.space	 Whatabout, Schools, Universities, Rich Individuals (around 250 people in the UK have more than 10 million dollars each). I reecieved mail from people who claimed they might get a person into space for $500 per pound. Send a skinny person into space and split the rest of the money among the ground crew! 
sci.space	 It may be that they just didn't mention it, or that they actually haven't thought about it. I got the vague impression from their mission proposal that they weren't taking a very holistic aproach to the whole thing. They seemed to want to land people on the Moon by the end of the decade without explaining why, or what they would do once they got there. The only application I remember from the Av Week article was placing a telescope on the Moon. That's great, but they don't explain why it can't be done robotically. 
sci.space	 I'm glad to see that someone is working on this. However, it would be nice if he got his units right. 
sci.space	 Sure. Contact the World Space Foundation. They're listed in the sci.space Frequently Asked Questions file, which I'll excerpt. 
sci.space	 Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts. For example, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a "safe" mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy gets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again. 
sci.space	 I don't know what a "low grade" fusion reactor is, but the major problem with 3He (aside from the difficulty in making any fusion reactor work) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so small -- on the order of 5 ppb or so, on average (more in some fractions, but still very small). Massive amounts of regolith would have to be processed.

sci.space	 Is posible to make copies of these photographs (or any other aerospace photographs at NASM) if you pay a copyright fee? 
sci.space	 Hmmmm.... The prefix "peri-" is Greek, not Latin, so it's usually used with the Greek form of the name of the body being orbited. (That's why it's "perihelion" rather than "perisol", "perigee" rather than "periterr", and "pericynthion" rather than "perilune".) So for Jupiter I'd expect it to be something like "perizeon".) :^)

sci.space	 I posted my public-domain MSDOS program "sunlight.zip" to "sci.astro" yesterday. It easily locates the sun, moon, and planets, and can also be used to locate other objects if you input their Right Ascesion and Declination. Use "uudecode" to extract. 
sci.space	 I don't know a whole lot on Proton, but given that it is a multi stage rocket, up to 4 stages, it may not really need the Centaur, plus it may end up seriously beating on said centaur.

sci.space	 Any prize like this is going to need to be worded carefully enough that you cannot get it without demonstrating sustained and reliable capability, rather than a lucky one-shot. It can be done. 
sci.space	 Apollo was done the hard way, in a big hurry, from a very limited technology base... and on government contracts. Just doing it privately, rather than as a government project, cuts costs by a factor of several. 
sci.space	 Hello. I am looking for a program (or algorithm) that can be used to compute sunrise and sunset times. 
sci.space	 I wouldn't worry about it. There's enough space debris up there that a mile-long inflatable would probably deflate in some very short period of time (less than a year) while cleaning up LEO somewhat. Sort of a giant fly-paper in orbit. 
sci.space	 Found it! Thanks. I got several offers for help. I appreciate it and will be contacting those people via e-mail. 
sci.space	 Other idea for old space crafts is as navigation beacons and such.. Why not?? If you can put them on "safe" "pause" mode.. why not have them be activated by a signal from a space craft (manned?) to act as a naviagtion beacon, to take a directional plot on?? 
sci.space	 The Apollo program cost something like $25 billion at a time when the value of a dollar was worth more than it is now. No one would take the offer. 
sci.space	 Hmm. $1 billion, lesse... I can probably launch 100 tons to LEO at $200 million, in five years, which gives about 20 tons to the lunar surface one-way. Say five tons of that is a return vehicle and its fuel, a bigger Mercury or something (might get that as low as two tons), leaving fifteen tons for a one-man habitat and a year's supplies? Gee, with that sort of mass margins I can build the systems off the shelf for about another hundred million tops. That leaves about $700 million profit. I like this idea 8-) Let's see if you guys can push someone to make it happen 8-) 8-) 
sci.space	 models of the plane in question (i.e. about to be sacrificed) begin to arrive in key Senators and Congresspersons' offices. 
sci.space	 I would just like to point out that it is much easier to place an object at orbital altitude than it is to place it with orbital velocity. For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth, you need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s. Assuming that rockets with specific impulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dry weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer. A small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or birdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would be the payload. I am sure the whole project is well within the capability of the amateur rocketry community. 
sci.space	 I would guess not. Dr. Neil Gehrels of CGRO is the son of Dr. Tom Gehrels of the University of Arizona. Since he's long had research interests in asteroids and other solar-system astronomy, Tom is the one more likely to have discovered a comet (and thus had his name attached to it). 
sci.space	 There is a whole constellation of custom built navigation beacon satellites in the process of being phased out right now. The TRANSIT/OSCAR satellites are being replaced by GPS. Or were you thinking of deep space navigation, which is best done with doppler/VLBI/ stellar measurements. I do not think additional radio beacons would help much. 
sci.space	 So how much would it cost as a private venture, assuming you could talk the U.S. government into leasing you a couple of pads in Florida? 
sci.space	 What is the deal with life on Mars? I save the "face" and heard associated theories. (which sound thin to me) 
sci.space	 Why would you want to do that? The goal is to do it cheaper (remember, this isn't government). Instead of leasing an expensive launch pad, just use a SSTO and launch from a much cheaper facility. 
sci.space	 Nick Haines sez; (given that I've heard the Shuttle software rated as Level 5 in maturity, I strongly doubt that this [having lots of bugs] is the case). 
sci.space	 My first thought is Ross Perot. After further consideration, I think he'd be more likely to try to win it...but come in a disappointing third. 
sci.space	 SEI Level 5 (the highest level -- the SEI stands for Software Engineering Institute). I'm not sure, but I believe that this rating only applies to the flight software. Also keep in mind that it was *not* achieved through the use of sophisticated tools, but rather through a 'brute force and ignorance' attack on the problem during the Challenger standdown - they simply threw hundreds of people at it and did the whole process by hand. I would not consider receiving a 'Warning' status on systems which are not yet in use would detract much (if anything) from such a rating -- I'll have to get the latest copy of the guidelines to make sure (they just issued new ones, I think). 
sci.space	 If by that you mean anything on the GD approach, there was an article on it in a recent Avation Week. I don't remember the exact date but it was recent. 
sci.space	 cost estimates are a bit over-optimistic. If nothing else, a working SSTO is at least as complex as a large airliner and has a smaller experience base. It therefore seems that SSTO development should cost at least as much as a typical airliner development. That puts it in the $3G to $5G range. 
sci.space	 All of this talk about a COMMERCIAL space race (i.e. $1G to the first 1-year moon base) is intriguing. Similar prizes have influenced aerospace development before. The $25k Orteig prize helped Lindbergh sell his Spirit of Saint Louis venture to his financial backers. 
sci.space	 Even worse, the city of Atlanta has a proposal before it to rent space on this orbiting billboard. Considering the caliber of people running this city, there's no telling what we're going to have leering down at us from orbit. 
sci.space	 When the Lunar Society's $500M estimate of the cost of a lunar colony was mentioned at Making Orbit, somebody asked Jerry Pournelle "have you talked to Bill Gates?". The answer: "Yes. He says that if he were going to sink that much money into it, he'd want to run it -- and he doesn't have the time." 
sci.space	 The "face" is an accident of light and shadow. There are many "faces" in landforms on Earth; none is artificial (well, excluding Mount Rushmore and the like...). There is also a smiley face on Mars, and a Kermit The Frog. 
sci.space	 I think this is a little inaccurate, based on Feynman's account of the software-development process *before* the standdown. Fred is basically correct: no sophisticated tools, just a lot of effort and painstaking care. But they got this one right *before* Challenger; Feynman cited the software people as exemplary compared to the engine people. (He also noted that the software people were starting to feel management pressure to cut corners, but hadn't had to give in to it much yet.) 
sci.space	 The commercial uses of a transportation system between already-settled- and-civilized areas are obvious. Spaceflight is NOT in this position. The correct analogy is not with aviation of the '30's, but the long transocean voyages of the Age of Discovery. It didn't require gov't to fund these as long as something was known about the potential for profit at the destination. In practice, some were gov't funded, some were private. But there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amount of money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff. I am sure that a thriving spaceflight industry will eventually develop, and large numbers of people will live and work off-Earth. But if you ask me for specific justifications other than the increased resource base, I can't give them. We just don't know enough. The launch rate demanded by existing space industries is just too low to bring costs down much, and we are very much in the dark about what the revolutionary new space industries will be, when they will practical, how much will have to be invested to start them, etc. 
sci.space	 Not quite true. One of the instruments on Mars Observer will be searching for potential fossil sites. 
sci.space	 This claim was made when someone spotted training film footage spliced into the footage of the actual spacewalk. 
sci.space	 One consideration to remember is that if you don't turn it off now, you may not be able to later. This isn't a case of reaching over and flipping a switch; much of the spacecraft has to be working correctly to execute a "turn off" command successfully. Spacecraft do malfunction in their old age. The big concern is not radio clutter from idle spacecraft, but radio clutter from malfunctioning spacecraft that can no longer be turned off. 
sci.space	 The Proton has been used in 2, 3, and 4 stage versions. The two stage version was used for the first 3 launches, while the 3 and 4 stage versions are used today. The four stage version is used mostly for escape (and geosynchronous?) orbits, while the 3 stage version is used for low earth orbits. Since this is the version that launched Mir and the Salyuts (and the add-on modules for Mir), as long as Centaur is smaller than Mir (which I believe it is), it should fit under the shroud. 
sci.space	 Unfortunately, if you launch this from the US (or are a US citizen), you will need a launch permit from the Office of Commercial Space Transportation, and I think it may be difficult to get a permit for an antisatellite weapon... :-) 
sci.space	 Well, if you're going to get upset with this, you might as well direct some of this moral outrage towards Glavcosmos as well. They pioneered this capitalist application of booster adverts long before NASA. (Sign of the times: a Sony logo on a Soyuz launcher...) 
sci.space	 For the purpose of a contest, I'd bet some things could be cut. Like fuel for re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc. Even still, if the contest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn't be worth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest). Just give me the cheapest heaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster... If I don't have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I'll use it. 
sci.space	 Thanks again. One final question. The name Gehrels wasn't known to me before this thread came up, but the May issue of Scientific American has an article about the "Inconstant Cosmos", with a photo of Neil Gehrels, project scientist for NASA's Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. Same person? 
sci.space	 Some time ago I sent the following message: Every once in a while I design an orbital space colony. I'm gearing up to do another one. I'd some info from you. If you were to move onto a space colony to live permanently, how big would the colony have to be for you to view a permanent move as desirable? Specifically, 
sci.space	 You have missed something. There is a big difference between being in the SAME PLANE and in exactly the same state (positions and velocities equal). IN addition to this, there has always been redundancies proposed. 
sci.space	 Also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode (probably a spin-stabilized sun-pointing orientation) is a dollar not spent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft. In order to turn the spacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the Ops guys will be available, or you need to retrain a new team. 
sci.space	 Then what do you believe will finally motivate people to leave the earth? I'm not trying to flame you. I just want to know where you stand. 
sci.space	 I haven't seen any speculation about it. But, the Salyut KB (Design Bureau) was planning a new LH/LOX second stage for the Proton which would boost payload to LEO from about 21000 to 31500 kg. (Geostationary goes from 2600 kg. (Gals launcher version) to 6000 kg.. This scheme was competing with the Energia-M last year and I haven't heard which won, except now I recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the successor to the Soyuz booster which must be the Energia-M. So the early results are Energia-M won, but this is a guess, nothing is very clear in Russia. I'm sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue their development. 
sci.space	 According to a Software engineering professor here, what was actually rated level five was an ibm unit which produced part of the software for the shuttle, by not means all of it. 
sci.space	 The Centaur that is being built for T4 would be a better bet to integrate onto the Proton as the T4/Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh envorinment of the T4 launch. It is also closer to 4 m in diameter. 
sci.space	 The CU people have been, and continue to be big ozone scientists. So this is consistent. It is also consistent with the new "Comercial applications" that NASA and Clinton are pushing so hard. 
sci.space	 Things could be worse. A lot worse! In the mid-eighties the teen/adult sci-fi comic 2000AD (Fleetway) produced a short story featuring the award winning character "Judge Dredd". The story focussed on an advertising agency of the future who use high powered multi-coloured lasers/search lights pointed at the moon to paint images on the moon. Needless to say, this use hacked off a load of lovers, romantics and werewolfs/crazies. The ad guys got chopped, the service discontinued. A cautionary tale indeed! 
sci.space	 altogether. The rocket is a commercial launch vechicle - a Conestoga flying a COMET payload. NASA is simply the primary customer. I believe SDIO has a small payload as well. The advertising space was sold by the owners of the rocket, who can do whatever they darn well please with it. In addition, these anonymous "observers" had no reason to be startled. The deal made Space News at least twice. 
sci.space	 Why must it be a US Government Space Launch Pad? Directly I mean.. I know of a few that could launch a small package into space. Not including Ariadne, and the Russian Sites.. I know "Poker Flats" here in Alaska, thou used to be only sounding rockets for Auroral Borealous(sp and other northern atmospheric items, is at last I heard being upgraded to be able to put sattelites into orbit. 
sci.space	 Hi, I was reading through "The Spaceflight Handbook" and somewhere in there the author discusses solar sails and the forces acting on them when and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by passing close to the sun in a hyperbolic orbit. The magnitude of such accelerations he estimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may not be a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was published in 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is very long-winded but here's my question finally - Are 45g accelerations in fact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices of course. If these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration? Can this be extended to larger accelerations? 
sci.space	 Here is a way to get the commericial companies into space and mineral exploration. 
sci.space	 Well thank you dennis for your as usual highly detailed and informative posting. 
sci.space	 Piper lived in my town (Williamsport, PA) when he killed himself. It was in the early '60's. He had had more than a few books published by that time, but he was down on his luck financially. Rumor was that he was hunting urban pigeons with birdshot for food. He viewed himself as a resourceful man, and (IMO) decided to check out gracefully if he couldn't support himself. The worst part is that John Campbell, the long-time editor of Astounding/Analog SF magazine had cut a check for Piper's most recent story, and said check was in the mail. If Campbell had known Piper's straits, I'm sure he would have phoned to say hang on. Campbell was like that. 
sci.space	 No. I estimate a 99 % probability the Gehrels referred to is Thomas Gehrels of the Spacewatch project, Kitt Peak observatory. 
sci.space	 You forget that Apollo was a Government program and had to start relatively from scratch. Some people at NASA think that this could work. One of them replied to me personally after I posted this original message several days ago. I have heard Jerry Pournelle suggest this idea before. 
sci.space	 Pageos and two Echo balloons were inflated with a substance which expanded in vacuum. Once inflated the substance was no longer needed since there is nothing to cause the balloon to collapse. This inflatable structure could suffer multiple holes with no disastrous deflation. 
sci.space	 I, for one, would be an avid reader of a sci.space.ussr.what.really. happened. 
sci.space	 The current mining regulations and fees were set in the 1800's! What the so-called "eco-freaks" want to do is to simply bring those fees in line with current economic reality. Currently, mining companies can get access to minerals on public lands for ridiculously low prices -- something like $50! The mining lobby has for decades managed to block any reform of these outdated fees. In fact, the latest attempt to reform them was again blocked -- President Clinton "compromised" by taking the mining fee reforms out of his '94 budget, and plans to draft separate legislation to fight that battle. If you want to discuss this further, I suggest you take this to talk.environment. 
sci.space	 Neil Gehrels is Prof. Tom Gehrels son. Tom Gehrels was the discoverer of P/Gehrels 3 (as well as about 4 other comets - the latest of which does not bear his name, but rather the name "Spacewatch" since he was observing with that system when he found the latest comet).

sci.space	 project. The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in hassles. 
sci.space	 This sounds a bit high to me. Still higher accelerations have been endured *very briefly*, during violent deceleration. If we're talking sustained acceleration, I think 30-odd gees has been demonstrated using water immersion. 
sci.space	 A related question (which I haven't given that much serious thought to): at what lattitude is the average length of the day (averaged over the whole year) maximized? Is this function a constant= 12 hours? Is it truly symmetric about the equator? Or is there some discrepancy due to the fact that the orbit is elliptic (or maybe the difference is enough to change the temperature and make the seasons in the southern hemisphere more bitter, but is far too small to make a sizeable difference in daylight hours)? 
sci.space	 Here is a computation I did a long time ago that computes the length of the daylight. You should be able to convert the information here to sunrise and sunset times.

sci.space	 Voyager has the unusual luck to be on a stable trajectory out of the solar system. All it's doing is collecting fields data, and routinely squirting it down. One of the mariners is also in stable solar orbit, and still providing similiar solar data. 
sci.space	 Besides this was the same line of horse puckey the mining companies claimed when they were told to pay for restoring land after strip mining. 
sci.space	 I once read an article on Computer technology which stated that every new computer technology was actually lower and slower then what it replaced. Silicon was less effective then the germanium products then available. GaAs was less capable then Silicon. Multi-processors were slower then existent single processors. 
sci.space	 Since we don't have the money to keep them going now, how will changing them to a seperate agency help anything? 
sci.space	 If raw materials where to cost enough that getting them from space would be cost effective then the entire world economy would colapse long before the space mines could be built. 
sci.space	 Hi guys, I've been hearing lots of talk on the net about DC-X and DC-Y, but none of the many posts actually explain what they are !!! Sorry if this is a FAQ, but would somebody please explain to me what they are. Reply by Email please . . . thanks. 
sci.space	 Hmmm. I seem to recall that the attraction of solid state record- players and radios in the 1960s wasn't better performance but lower per-unit cost than vacuum-tube systems. 
sci.space	 As for advertising -- sure, why not? A NASA friend and I spent one drunken night figuring out just exactly how much gold mylar we'd need to put the golden arches of a certain American fast food organization on the face of the Moon. Fortunately, we sobered up in the morning. 
sci.space	 Tonigth a TV journal here in Brasil announced that an object, beyond Pluto's orbit, was found by an observatory at Hawaii. They named the object Karla. 
sci.space	 Pat sez; Oddly, enough, The smithsonian calls the lindbergh years the golden age of flight. I would call it the granite years, reflecting the primitive nature of it. It was romantic, swashbuckling daredevils, "those daring young men in their flying machines". But in reality, it sucked. Death was a highly likely occurence, and the environment blew. 
sci.space	 Press Release No.19-93 Paris, 22 April 1993 
sci.space	 Feasability study?? What a wimp!! While you are studying, others would be doing. Too damn many engineers doing way too little engineering. 
sci.space	 DFW was designed with the STS in mind (which really mean very little). Much of their early PR material had scenes with a shuttle landing and two or three others pulled up to gates. I guess they were trying to stress how advanced the airport was. 
sci.space	 The Centaur is controlled technology.. State Dept will not allow it to be used outside of US. Sorry. In article <1993Apr20.211638.168730@zeus.calpoly.edu jgreen@trumpet.calpoly.edu (James Thomas Green) writes: Has anyone looked into the possiblity of a Proton/Centaur combo? What would be the benefits and problems with such a combo (other than the obvious instability in the XSSR now)? 
sci.space	 The only ether I see here is the stuff you must have been breathing before you posted... 
sci.space	 What do you mean? Are you saying they thought the effort was profitable or that the money was efficiently spent (providing max value per money spent)? 
sci.space	 But Allen, if you can assume the existence of an SSTO there is no need to have the contest in the first place. I would think that what we want to get out of the contest is the development of some of these 'cheaper' ways of doing things; if they already exist, why flush $1G just to get someone to go to the Moon for a year? 
sci.space	 Why use a ground launch pad. It is entirely posible to launch from altitude. This was what the Shuttle was originally intended to do! It might be seriously cheaper. 
sci.space	 Would you mind posting the responses you get? I am also interested, and there may be others. 
sci.space	 News-Software: UReply 3.1 X-X-From: Wingert@VNET.IBM.com (Bret Wingert) <C5uBn5.tz@zoo.toronto.edu 
sci.space	 Allen, sometimes I think you're OK. And sometimes you tend to rashly leap into making statement without thinking them out. 
sci.space	 I've heard of sillier things, like a well-known utility company wanting to buy an 'automated' boiler-cleaning system which uses as many operators as the old system, and which rumour has it costs three million more per unit. Automation is more 'efficient' although by what scale they are not saying... 
sci.space	 Yes, and I do everyone else. Why, you may wonder, don't I do 'Fred'? Well, that would just be too *obvious*, wouldn't it? Oh yeah, this isn't my real name, either. I'm actually Elvis. Or maybe a lemur; I sometimes have difficulty telling which is which. 
sci.space	 Well Henry, we are often reminded how CANADA is not a part of the United States (yet). You could have quite a commercial A-SAT, er sky-cleaning service going in a few years. 
sci.space	 Of course; sorry for the misunderstanding. I was referring to the fact that far more aeronautical development took place in the '30's. For much of the '20's, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the industry. By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired and Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point where long-distance flights became practical. It's important to note that the Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927: Lindbergh, Chamberlin and Levine, and Byrd's _America_. "When it's time to railroad, you railroad." 
sci.space	 Ah, there's the rub. And a catch-22 to boot. For the purposes of a contest, you'll probably not compete if'n you can't afford the ride to get there. And although lower priced delivery systems might be doable, without demand its doubtful that anyone will develop a new system. Course, if a low priced system existed, there might be demand... 
sci.space	 I don't think so at first, but solid state offered better reliabity, id bet, and any lower costs would be only after the processes really scaled up. 
sci.space	 Seems like a lot of trouble to go to. Its probably better to invest in newer launch systems. I don't think a big cost advantage for using Russian systems will last for very long (maybe a few years). Lockheed would be the place to ask, since you would probably have to buy the Proton from them (they market the Proton world wide except Russia). They should know a lot about the possibilities, I haven't heard them propose US launches, so I assume they looked into it and found it unprofitable. 
sci.space	 Well, I guess I'm left wondering just who all the 'light fascists' think *they* are. Yes, I understand the issues. I don't even particularly care for the idea. But am I the only one that finds the sort of overreaction above just a *little* questionable? You must find things like the Moon *really* obnoxious in their pollution. 
sci.space	 If not for the lack of extraneously capitalized words, I'd swear that McElwaine had changed his name and moved to Cal Poly. I also find the choice of newsgroups 'interesting'. Perhaps someone should tell this guy that 'sci.astro' doesn't stand for 'astrology'? 
sci.space	 MB So the MB 1970 figure seems unlikely to actually be anything but a perijove. 
sci.space	 Doug-- Actually, if memory serves, the Atlas is an outgrowth of the old Titan ICBM. If so, there's probably quite a few old pads, albeit in need of some serious reconditioning. Still, Being able to buy the turf and pad (and bunkers, including prep facility) at Midwest farmland prices strikes me as pretty damned cheap. 
sci.space	 such a contest without delving to deep into the budget. I mentioned granting mineral rights to the winner (my actual wording was, "mining rights.) Somebody pointed out, quite correctly, that such rights are not anybody's to grant (although I imagine it would be a fait accompli situation for the winner.) So how about this? Give the winning group (I can't see one company or corp doing it) a 10, 20, or 50 year moratorium on taxes. 
sci.space	 No. The idea was suggested around here during discussions of possible near-term commercial space activities. One of the folks involved in those discussions, a spacecraft engineer named Preston Carter, passed the suggestion on to some entreprenurial types, and Mike Lawson is apparently going ahead with it. Preston is now at LLNL, and is working with Space Marketing on the sensors that might be carried. 
sci.space	 You may change that to 100% certainty. But to clarify, Spacewatch is a University of Arizona project using a telescope of the Steward Observatory located on Kitt Peak. It is not associated with Kitt Peak National Observatory, other than sharing a mountain. 
sci.space	 Actually, the "ether" stuff sounded a fair bit like a bizzare, qualitative corruption of general relativity. nothing to do with the old-fashioned, ether, though. maybe somebody could loan him a GR text at a low level. 
sci.space	 How could this possibly be "environmental vandalism" when there is no "environment" to vandalize up there? 
sci.space	 The name is a working name only; quite unofficial. The formal designation is 1993 FW. 
sci.space	 You'd need to launch HLVs to send up large amounts of stuff *if* you assume no new launcher development. If you assume new launcher development, with lower costs as a specific objective, then you probably don't want to build something HLV-sized anyway. 
sci.space	 You're assuming that the low-cost delivery system has to be a separate project. But why? If you are spending hundreds of millions of dollars in hopes of winning a billion-dollar prize, it is *cheaper* to develop your own launch system, charging its entire development cost against your contest entry, than to try to do it with existing launchers. No other demand is necessary. 
sci.space	 Nope, you're confusing separate programs. Atlas was the first-generation US ICBM; Titan I was the second-generation one; Titan II, which all the Titan launchers are based on, was the third-generation heavy ICBM. There was essentially nothing in common between these three programs. 
sci.space	 Sorry, not so -- the changes in sunrise and sunset times are not quite synchronized. For example, neither the earliest sunrise nor the latest sunset comes on the longest day of the year. 
sci.space	 Other idea for old space crafts is as navigation beacons and such.. Why not?? 
sci.space	 There was an interesting article in Scientific American some time ago about breathing liquid. (It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.) As far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid: - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own breathing effort (let alone anything else) 
sci.space	 How about transferring control to a non-profit organisation that is able to accept donations to keep craft operational. 
sci.space	 Who says there is no mineral rights to be given? Who says? The UN or the US Government? Major question is if you decide to mine the moon or Mars, who will stop you? The UN can't other than legal tom foolerie.. Can the truly inforce it? 
sci.space	 I aint talking the large or even the "mining companies" I am talking the small miners, the people who have themselves and a few employees (if at all).The people who go out every year and set up thier sluice box, and such and do mining the semi-old fashion way.. (okay they use modern methods toa point). 
sci.space	 Seems that the Mile-Long Billboard and any other inflateble space object/station or what ever have the same problems. (other than being a little bit different than the "normal" space ideas, such as trusses and shuttles)

sci.space	 This activity is regularly reported in Ron's interesting posts. Could someone explain what the Command Loss Timer is?

sci.space	 error; Nick Adams was a film and TV actor from the '50's and early '60's (remember Johnny Yuma, The Rebel?). He was from my part of the country, and Michael's email address of "nmsca[...]" probably helped confuse things in my mind. Purely user headspace error on my part. Sorry.

sci.space	 Writer Kathy Sawyer reported in today's Washington Post that Joseph Shea, the head of the space station redesign has resigned for health reasons. 
sci.space	 Let us hope that the performance of the spacecraft follows the sentiments of the first verse (miner) rather than the second (lost and gone forever). 
sci.space	 The Command Loss Timer is part of the fault protection scheme of the spacecraft. If the Command Loss Timer ever countdowns to zero, then the spacecraft assumes it has lost communications with Earth and will go through a set of predetermined steps to try to regain contact. The Command Loss Timer is set to 264 hours and reset about once a week during the cruise phase, and is set to a lower value during an encounter phase. ___ _____ ___ /_ /| /____/ /_ /| Ron Baalke | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ /| | | | Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/ | | |__ M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | | ___/ | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/ |_|/ |_____|/ | part vegetable. 
sci.space	 They aren't going to leave a loophole as glaring as space mining. Quite a few of those people are, when you come right down to it, basically against industrial civilization. They won't stop with shutting down the mines here; that is only a means to an end for them now. 
sci.space	 The problem is, you can't raise adequate amounts of money that way. The Viking Fund tried. They did succeed, in a way, but only because of the political impact of their fundraising. The actual amount of money they raised was fairly inconsequential; it would not have kept the Viking lander going by itself. 
sci.space	 If I'm not mistaken, this is the usual sort of precaution against loss of communications. That timer is counting down continuously; if it ever hits zero, that means Galileo hasn't heard from Earth in a suspiciously long time and it may be Galileo's fault... so it's time to go into a fallback mode that minimizes chances of spacecraft damage and maximizes chances of restoring contact. I don't know exactly what-all Galileo does in such a situation, but a common example is to switch receivers, on the theory that maybe the one you're listening with has died.

sci.space	 The Command Loss Timer is a timer that does just what its name says; it indicates to the probe that it has lost its data link for receiving commands. Upon expiration of the Command Loss Timer, I believe the probe starts a 'search for Earth' sequence (involving antenna pointing and attitude changes which consume fuel) to try to reestablish communications. No-ops are sent periodically through those periods when there are no real commands to be sent, just so the probe knows that we haven't forgotten about it.

I would think that an asymmetric design, sort of like wingless Orbiter, may work better, since less shielding is required on the top side. Can anybody explain?

sci.space	 The HGA isn't all that reflective in the wavelengths that might "cook the focal elements", nor is its figure good on those scales--the problem is that the antenna _itself_ could not be exposed to Venus-level sunlight, lest like Icarus' wings it melt. (I think it was glues and such, as well as electronics, that they were worried about.) Thus it had to remain furled and the axis _always_ pointed near the sun, so that the small sunshade at the tip of the antenna mast would shadow the folded HGA. (A larger sunshade beneath the antenna shielded the spacecraft bus.) 
sci.space	 Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are seen coming equally from all directions. However, given the number of bright ones, there are too few faint ones to be consistent with being equally dense for as far as we can see--it is as if they are all contained within a finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at the center. (These measurements are statistical, and you can always hide a sufficiently small number of a different type of GRB with a different origin in the data. I am assuming that there is only one population of GRBs). 
sci.space	 I just got out of the Army. Go signal corps or Intelligence; photointelligence interpretation. If you go ADA you might get to play with rockets but space will look pretty far away dug in the mud next to a grunt protecting the foward troops from low flying objects. Good Luck 
sci.space	 Thanks for these surreal moments.... Srinivas 
sci.space	 I am puzzled by the term "concept." Drag free may already have been flown. It was the idea behind putting up a spacecraft that would more accurately respond to motions from the Earth's gravity field and ignore drag. It was proposed many years ago and involved a ball floating between sensors whose job it was to signal to little adjustment jets to keep the ball away from them. The ball itself would then be in a drag free condition and respond only to gravity anisotropies, whereas the spacecraft itself would be continuously adjusting its position to compensate for drag. 
sci.space	 Did the Russian spacecraft(s) on the ill-fated Phobos mission a few years ago send back any images of the Martian moon? If so, does anyone know if they're housed at an ftp site?" 'Thanks.

sci.space	 I am looking for any information about the space program. This includes NASA, the shuttles, history, anything! I would like to know if anyone could suggest books, periodicals, even ftp sites for a novice who is interested in the space program. 
sci.space	 Well, lets see....I took a class on this last fall, and I have no notes so I'll try to wing it... Here's how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that black holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars, M(star)=1.4M(sun). High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking appoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova. In this time, they don't live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any of these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB's) will be in the plane of the galaxy. Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the various satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either Pion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our catalog. These tests all show, that the bursts have an isotropic distribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of homogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction. So, unless we are sampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE. Not cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things. Now, I suppose you are saying, "Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the disk." Well, not necessarily. Remember, we have what is more or less an interplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out to beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite. Here's an analogy: You see a plane overhead. You measure the angle of the plane from the origin of your arbitrary coordinate system. One of your friends a mile away sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his arbitrary system, which is the same as yours. The two angles are different, and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe find a source. To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this. I should throw in why halo, and corona models don't work, also. As I said before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short timescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of behavior. If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound to the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources. When you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk, but you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see not only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources in the direction of the galactic center. As I said before, there is none of these characteristics. 
sci.space	 SOmebody mentioned a re-boost of HST during this mission, meaning that Weight is a very tight margin on this mission. 
sci.space	 Yes, the Phobos mission did return some useful data including images of Phobos itself. The best I've seen had a surface resolution of about 40 meters. By the way, the new book entitled "Mars" (Kieffer et al, 1992, University of Arizona Press) has a great chapter on spacecraft exploration of the planet. The chapter is co-authored by V.I. Moroz of the Space Research Institute in Moscow, and includes details never before published in the West. Don't know of any ftp sites with images though. 
sci.space	 Sorry for asking a question that's not entirely based on the technical aspects of space, but I couldn't find the answer on the FAQs ! 
sci.space	 Actually, the reboost will probably be done last, so that there is a fuel reserve during the EVAs (in case they have to chase down an adrift astronaut or something like that). But yes, you've got the idea -- the reboost is done by taking the whole shuttle up. 
sci.space	 Was that post for real? I thought it was a late April Fool joke. Some of it seemed a bit over the top even by McElwaine/Abian/etc standards :-) 
sci.space	 Even easier to implement than writing messages on the Moon, once upon a time a group of space activists I belonged to in Seattle considered a "Goodyear Blimp in orbit". The idea was to use a large structure that could carry an array of lights like the Goodyear Blimp has. Placed in a low Earth orbit of high inclination, it could eventually be seen by almost everyone on Earth. Only our collective disapproval of cluttering up space with such a thing stopped us from pursuing it. It had quite feasible economics, which I will not post here because I don't want to encourage the idea (if you want to do such a thing, go figure it out for yourself). 
sci.space	 It has been known for quite a while that the earth is actually more pear shaped than globular/spherical. Does anyone make a "globe" that is accurate as to actual shape, landmass configuration/Long/Lat lines etc.? Thanks in advance. 
sci.space	 Two developments have brought these type of activities back to the forefront in 1993. First, in February, the Russians deployed a 20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from the Mir Space Station. While this "Banner" reflector was blank, NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future Banner reflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space- based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV commercial, as filmed from the Mir. The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the same company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga booster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental Billboard". As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the University of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental Billboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to 804x1609 meters. Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area, deployed by the inflatable 'frame'. To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading sensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth's delicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of SMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum exposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns, it will release ozone-building components that will literally replenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor the atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns up and "adds to the ozone supply." This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several millions of dollars (exact costs were not available). But SMI estimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who watched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising 'unit' cost $600,000. Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. 
sci.space	 Brian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...] And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN news blip? How serious is this project? Is this just in the "wild idea" stage or does it have real funding? 
sci.space	 I don't think you're going to be able to see the differences from a sphere unless they are greatly exaggerated. Even the equatorial bulge is only about 1 part in 300 -- you'd never notice a 1mm error in a 30cm globe -- and the other deviations from spherical shape are much smaller.

sci.space	 TRIAD, the first drag-free satellite, was designed and built by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and launched 2 Sept 1972. The satellite was in three sections separated by two booms. The central section housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity. The proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation pressure. Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered around the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free. 
sci.space	 If all of these things have been detected in space, has anyone looked into possible problems with the detectors? 
sci.space	 As for SF and advertising in space. There is a romantic episode in Mead's "The Big Ball of Wax" where the lovers are watching the constellation Pepsi Cola rising over the horizon and noting the some 'stars' had slipped cause the Teamsters were on strike. 
sci.space	 That would not explain why widely separated detectors, such as on Ulysses and PVO and Ginga et al., would see a burst at the same time(*). In fact, be- fore BATSE, having this widely separated "Interplanetary Network" was the only sure way to locate a random burst. With only one detector, one cannot locate a burst (except to say "It's somewhere in the field of view."). With two detectors, one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky. With three detectors, one gets intersecting annuli, giving two possible locations. If one of these locations is impossible (because, say, the Earth blocked that part of the sky), voila, you have an error box.

sci.space	 The name is rather descriptive. It's a command to the spacecraft that tells it "If you don't hear from Earth after 264 hours, assume something is wrong with your (the spacecraft) attitude, and go into a preprogrammed search mode in an attempt to reacquire the signal from Earth." 
sci.space	 I assume that can only be guessed at by the assumed energy of the event and the 1/r^2 law. So, if the 1/r^2 law is incorrect (assume some unknown material [dark matter??] inhibits Gamma Ray propagation), could it be possible that we are actually seeing much less energetic events happening much closer to us? The even distribution could be caused by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma rays being shorter then 1/2 the thickness of the disk of the galaxy.

soc.religion.christian	 Maybe cyclical is not the best word. That is one aspect of it. In the case of the virgin birth prophecy, it applied to the then and there, and also prophetically to Christ. The army that threatened the king would cease to be a threat in a very short time. Yet it also prophecied of Christ. 
soc.religion.christian	 Anything that does not bring me closer to God is a sin. (If you think this is too strict, just consider how ambiguous it is.) 
soc.religion.christian	 Jayne stands in pretty good company. C.S. Lewis wrote a whole book promoting the idea contained in her first sentence quoted above. It is called "The Final Divorce". Excellent book on the subject of Heaven and Hell, highly recommended. It's an allegory of souls who are invited, indeed beseeched to enter Heaven, but reject the offer because being with God in Heaven means giving up their false pride. 
soc.religion.christian	 There are a lot of people running around saying "God told me this" and "God told me that" these days. Some people really have heard God, and others heard their glands. Mario Murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once. He said someone told him, "The Lord gave me a song." He said that it was the worst song he had ever heard. 
soc.religion.christian	 Yes, it's important to realize that all actions have consequences, and that "rules" were made for our own good. But to suggest that a *disease* is a *punishment* for certain types of sin I think is taking things much too far. If we got some kind of mouth disease for lying, would any of us have mouths left? What if we developed blindness every time we lusted after someone or something? I dare say all of us would be walking into walls. 
soc.religion.christian	 Andrew Kille reponded There is a collection of gospels which usually goes under the name of the "Essene Gospel of Peace." These are derived from the gnostics, not the essenes, and are ostensibly translations from syriac texts of the fourth and fifth centuries (I vaguely recall; I can't find my copy right now). --clh] 
soc.religion.christian	 I seldom see any posts in this group. Is anyone out there in Christendom listening? If so, why don't we get some dialog going here?

soc.religion.christian	 Is life a pass/fail course, and does God grade on a curve? I'm new here, and only vaguely religious, but I want to know what some of you people think. Specifically, are there an infinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one that he/she deserves? Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?) Also, are we "graded" by those around us, or has there always been some unchanging method? Is the person's childhood taken into account?' "I'm sure these must sound like over-simplifications to most of you, but I figure that you're the experts. 
soc.religion.christian	 This is one of the differences between OT prophecy and NT prophecy. In the NT, it is expected that when believers gather, - people will prophesy - the prophecy must be judged (1 Cor 14:29) There is nothing about killing someone who makes a mistake.

soc.religion.christian	 A question for you - can you give me the name of an organization or a philosophy or a political movement, etc., which has never had anything evil done in its name? You're missing a central teaching of Christianity - man is inherently sinful. We are saved through faith by grace. Knowing that, believing that, does not make us without sin. Furthermore, not all who consider themselves "christians" are (even those who manage to head their own "churches"). "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven." - Matt. 7:21. 
soc.religion.christian	 Pardon me, a humble atheist, but exactly what is the difference between holding a revealed truth with blind faith as its basis (i.e. regardless of any evidence that you may find to the contrary) as an absolute truth, fully expecting people to believe you and arrogance? 
soc.religion.christian	 Firstly, I am an atheist. I am not posting here as an immature flame start, but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience. 
soc.religion.christian	 That's a very weak argument--due the lack (with regard to critical events) of independent supporting texts. 
soc.religion.christian	 While I agree with most of Jon says (I deleted those parts, of course), I have serious reservations about this advice. Maintaining a `just friends' level of relationship is much easier said than done. People usually end up getting hurt. This is especially likely to happen when they start off with feelings of attraction. 
soc.religion.christian	 I can't speak for Mr. Cavano, but I understood his comment to refer to the idea that unrecognized pantheism is dangerous to Christians. If we unthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed to Christianity, we can pervert our faith. When we clearly recognize pantheism when we encounter it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with Christianity and reject what isn't. 
soc.religion.christian	 I was at my parents' Seder and noticed the labelling on one of the packages was English, Hebrew and French. In the phrase "kosher for passover" the French word used was "Pa^ques." We've deliberately mistranslated this at the Kulikauskas home and keep referring to foods being kosher for Easter. :-) 
soc.religion.christian	 I no longer have the textbook, but abstinence was defined as something like "no contact between the penis and the vagina, vulva, or area immediately surrounding the vulva, and no transfer of semen to the vagina, vulva, or area surrounding the vulva". 
soc.religion.christian	 I am a good Catholic boy. A convert no less, attracted by the rational tradition [Aquinas et al] and the emotional authenticity [in comp. with the faddishness of Anglicanism] to Roman Catholicism. I never had much time for the pope - or any other heirarchs - but I did, and do, believe in the sacremental system. I always felt quite happy to look down my nose at those such as John Emery [a few posts back] who had to engage in circuitous textual arguments to prove their faith, entirely oblivious to the fact that a dozen other faiths can do the same [with miracles too], and that since their arguments depend on the belief in the Bible as God's sole revelation, it was not very good logic to argue that the Bible proved God. No, I was happy to accept the CHURCH as God's revelation. It was the Church after all that existed before the Bible, the Church that choose [under grace of course] the canon of scripture. Protestant ludicrosity, I thought, was shown by Protestants breathtaking acceptance of Luther's right to reject a dozen or so books he disliked. But recently I read Peter Brown's _Body and Society_. It is very well researched, and well written. But is raises some very upsetting questions. The early Christians were weird - even more so than today's carzy fundies. They had odd views on sex, odder views on the body, totally ludicrous views about demons, and distinctly uncharitable views about other human beings. now the question is this: were the first Christians just as weird, but we've got used to them, or did the pristine "Fall of the Church" happen within one generation. It certainly did'nt have to wait until the Triumph of the Church under Constantine. If so, wha does this say about God's promise to always support the Church. It's no use throwing the usual Protestant pieties about the Church not being an organization at me. It's a community or it is nothing, and it was the early communities that were weird. The institional church was a model of sanity by comparison. I would be interested in serious Catholic and Orthodox responses to this entirely serious issue. I'm not sure it is an issue for Protestants with their "soul alone with Jesus" approach, but for we who see the "ecclesia" as a "koinoia" over time and space, the weird early Christians are a problem. 
soc.religion.christian	 But what was wrong with it? It won't tempt anyone to any kind of sin, as far as I can tell. It doesn't belittle anyone. It does not substitute offensiveness for humor (it's genuinely funny). 
soc.religion.christian	 however, the word "pa^ques" in french _is_ the word for easter. ask any francophone, whether from quebec or from paris. besides, haven't you heard of the phrase "the paschal lamb" (meaning jesus)?

soc.religion.christian	 Having lived through the kicking and screaming in the 60s and 70s as the Catholics were invited to participate in the liturgy instead of counting their rosary beads during Mass, I find this comment interesting. There is a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts without active participation. If you know the Latin, one really beautiful way to hear the Passion is it's being chanted by three deacons: the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants in the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor. This is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion that John would prefer. 
soc.religion.christian	 So what's your point? Mark's comment still is valid. To suggest that AIDS is "deserved" IS ludicrous. I sin. I can resolve to abstain from sin, and do weekly (more often, actually). Yet I routinely fail. I surely do deserve what I get, yet God compassionately provided the Incarnate Logos, Jesus, as a rememdy and a way out of our situation. If AIDS is deserved, I surely deserve instant death just as much, as do we all, as St. Paul so cogently remids us. 
soc.religion.christian	 I wish that you had followed this thread before jumping to conclusions. I haven't seen anybody write that AIDS was a *punishment* for certain types of sin (this includes Mark Ashley who you were responding to here). I myself wrote that when you don't do things God's way that curses will come on you and others. Although one definition of 'curse' is 'retribution', I only meant 'harm or misfortune' when I used the word. Because God loves us he has told us the best way to live in his Bible. God doesn't cause curses, he warns us of them. 
soc.religion.christian	 Which listsev was this and is the discussion still current? My questioning is based on some information presented from the Essene NT that challenges some of my eating choices. As the info came from a biased (opposed to my preferences) third party I am looking for info as to whether I should dismiss this work or put some consideration into it. Thanks again for info! 
soc.religion.christian	 Just what are these "scientific facts"? I have never heard of such a thing. Science never proves or disproves any theory - history does. 
soc.religion.christian	 you, if you shall ask the Father for anything, He will give it to you in my name. Until now you have asked for nothing in My name; ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full." -John 16:23-24 
soc.religion.christian	 Not quite correct. Biblical teaching expects us to celebrate the resurrection of Christ not once a year but every time someone is baptized. Col. 2:12-Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead." Rom. 6:4-Therefore we are buried with him in baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life." Those really want to celebrate the resurrection should by faith walk in newness of life after baptism. It is not necessary to celebrate a pagan goddess in the process. 
soc.religion.christian	 First of all, the original poster misquoted. The reference is from 2 Tim 3:16. The author was Paul, and his revelations were anything but "(at best) second-hand". 
soc.religion.christian	 Actually, an apostle is someone who is sent. If you will, mailmen could be called apostles in that sense. However, with Jesus, they were designated and were given power. Remember that there were many thousands of people who witnessed what Jesus did. That didn't make them apostles, though. 
soc.religion.christian	 He doesn't contradict himself. The church is to last for all time. However, there are those who use the church to bolster themselves. This is evident in many letters. For instance, Paul talks about the "super-apostles" to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11-12), he mentions how people will be led away by miracles, signs, and wonders (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12), he tells Timothy that it is clear that some will abandon the faith and teach lies (1 Timothy 4:1-3) and that some will search for teachers to suit what they want to hear (2 Timothy 4:3-4). Such passages go throughout the letters and Jesus does warn about them (Matthew 24:4-14). But look at the promise in this last part. Verse 14: "And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come." Even today, there are false teachings. I can name two which I am well familiar with: the non-need of baptism and the "praying of Jesus into your life for salvation". Both are taught. Both are DEAD wrong. They have been taken out of context from some verses, interpreted from others, and just plain made up. The ONLY way Jesus taught is given in Luke 9:23-26 and Luke 14:25-33. He then commands baptism in Matthew 28:18-20. The church Jesus founded, though, is alive and well. It's not being persecuted as much as back then (the laws won't allow it yet), but it is being persecuted. 
soc.religion.christian	 Of course, I'd still recommend that Michael read _True and Reasonable_ by Douglas Jacoby. 
soc.religion.christian	 Sorry for taking this off of Sharon's resp, but I'd also like to add some more verses to that and perhaps answer the second Q. 
soc.religion.christian	 The ONLY unity I've found which is true is when all parties involved are disciples. I came out of a church in which even the different congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was better and who had the better messages (while none of them put anything into practice from those messages). Since becoming a disciple, I've found that when I travel to another church in the same movement, they are just as accepting there as any other. We had a retreat back in January when some of the congregation from Louisville, KY came up (this retreat was for college students) and it was as though I had known even the people from Louisville for years (and I had only become a disciple the previous April and had never been to the church in Kentucky). One of the keys to unity is unselfish love and self-sacrifice. That is only one area in which disciples stand out from "Christians". Also, another part of unity is a common depth of conviction. I've also been a part of some "Christian" campus fellowships who were focused on unity between churches and saw that those churches had one thing involved: a lack of conviction about everything they believed. That was why they could be unified, they didn't care about the truth but delighted in getting along together. 
soc.religion.christian	 Were the early Christians weird? Yes! So were their non-Christian contemporaries (the more familiar you are with late Republican Rome or the Pricipate, the weirder those people will seem -- forget the creative filtering done by Renaissance and Eighteenth Century hero worship.) So are modern non-Christians. And Christians. 
soc.religion.christian	 I have found that this isn't a very effective argument. Most atheists are perfectly willing to acknowledge the existence and ministry of Jesus--but are quite capable of rationalizing the miracles and the resurrection into misunderstandings, hoaxes, or simple fabrications. They can always make an analogy with the _Iliad_, a book that tells the story of the historical Trojan War, but also talks about gods and goddesses and their conversations. I don't think it's possible to convince atheists of the validity of Christianity through argument. We have to help foster faith and an understanding of God. I could be wrong--are there any former atheists here who were led to Christianity by argument? 
soc.religion.christian	 Much of the OT prophecies have a double application: to the Jewish captivity, and to the end of time. But if Rev. is dated at AD96 its prophecies could not apply to the AD70 destructioin of Jerusalem. 
soc.religion.christian	 Adam, I just finished a study on this, not only looking at the prophecies themselves, but where they were fulfilled. While going only through the OT, I found 508 references. After starting to show their fulfillment, I found out that I had missed some, so needless to say I cannot post them here. However, the study I did I intend to publish (I am in the process of organizing and showing the fulfillments, then I will be ready to write and send it to a publisher). With any luck (and/or free time) I should have it finally done sometime around September (I hope). 
soc.religion.christian	 I question the implications of this statement; namely, that there are certain physical acts which are limited to God and that attempting to replicate these acts is blasphemy against God. God caused a bush to burn without being consumed--if I do the same thing, am I usurping God's role? Religious people are threatened by science because it has been systematically removing the physical "proofs" of God's existence. As time goes on we have to rely more and more on faith and the spiritual world to relate to God becuase science is removing our props. I don't think this is a bad thing. 
soc.religion.christian	 Many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, since respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations. This doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it. 
soc.religion.christian	 I'd like to share my thoughts on this topic of "arrogance of Christians" and look forward to any responses. In my encounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their belief that their faith is total truth. According to them, their beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of God and God is truth - thus they know the truth. This stance makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own hesitations about Christianity because they see no other way. Their way is the 'truth.' 
soc.religion.christian	 Sorry, but I think this interpretation of the Matthew 13 parables is nonsense. I.e., 
soc.religion.christian	 I would like to see Christians devote a bit less effort to _bashing_ paganism and more to figuring out how to present the Gospel to pagans. 
soc.religion.christian	 Why do we follow God so blindly? Have you ever asked a physically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog? The answer is quite simple--the dog can see, and the blind person cannot. 
soc.religion.christian	 I don't understand who this post is directed towards; who are you trying to convince? By its subject i would assume you are directing the argument towards people who do not believe that Christ rose from the dead, but in your "proof," you use the bible exclusively. 
soc.religion.christian	 Your very starting point is wrong. Christianity is not based on following a moral standard. "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith... NOT BY WORKS so that no man may boast." (Eph. 2:7-8) You say that you know the Bible well, and can recognize (do you mean recite?) many passages from memory. That could very well be so. However, it looks like there are a few more passages that you should pay attention to. (Titus 3:5 and James 2:10 are among them.) 
soc.religion.christian	 Being a parent in need of some help, I ask that you bear with me while I describe the situation which plagues me... 
soc.religion.christian	 Ah, double-fulfillment. First of all I would say that I'm not sure all the prophecies had double-fulfillment, e.g., the Isaiah 7:14 prophecy. 
soc.religion.christian	 The problems with Catholic liturgy are likely to continue for some time. The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a symbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that the _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar, Relics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real, almost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real sacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all to be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking precludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it simply IS holy. 
soc.religion.christian	 I realize I'm entering this discussion rather late, but I do have one question. Wasn't it a Reagan appointee, James Watt, a pentacostal christian (I think) who was the secretary of the interior who saw no problem with deforestation since we were "living in the last days" and ours would be the last generation to see the redwoods anyway? 
soc.religion.christian	 Hmmm... people in the americas before the time of Christ, children who die young, etc. ? 
soc.religion.christian	 The parable of the Prodigal Son is not about who is and who isn't an immoral person. It is about grace and the love of God. Most people would agree with that concerning the younger son. The elder son is simply a negative example of the some thing. He thinks that he must earn his father's love, that he has earned it, that he is entitled to it. His father tells him that he is on the wrong track. He has always been loved--for the same reason his brother has always been: he is his father's son. 
soc.religion.christian	 No one was ever flogged, beaten, burned, fed to the lions, or killed in any other way because of a belief in the resurrection - sorry to disappoint you. The idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different forms in the religions of antiquity. The problem was not the resurrection which was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population (the Saducees) but was a non issues for everyone else. The real problem was that Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god. When the state operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor - monotheism becomes a capital offense. The Jews were able to get exemption from this, and were also not evangelistic. Christians were far more vocal, and gentile, and hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution. Also since Christians were a relatively powerless group, they made good scapegoats as is seen by Nero's blaming them for the burning of Rome. Let's not cloud the issues with the resurrection. 
soc.religion.christian	 I can't find the reference right now, but didn't C.S.Lewis speculate somewhere that hell might be "the state of once having been a human soul"? 
soc.religion.christian	 Does anyone know any good decipleship trainning program during min August to end of Sept. Or any missionary programs. I currently belong to the Missionary Alliance Church in Oregon. Please reply by mail. 
soc.religion.christian	 One interpretation I've heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin of physically abusing one's wife. The husband is usually physically stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her. He must honor her as his sister in Christ. This would therefore be an example of a specific sin that blocks prayer. 
soc.religion.christian	 Eric ("Damien"?) was presenting his views on Christianity; I'll respond to a few of his points: 
soc.religion.christian	 I'm not surprised that you see no wisdom in them. That is because your premises are wrong from the word "Go". You claim that Christianity is based on blind faith, but this simply is not so. Just look at the current thread on the evidence for Jesus' resurrection for evidence that Jesus was real and that he triumphed over death. 
soc.religion.christian	 Note that the above type of prediction does not require a God to be made. An expert in a field can also predict things based on experience. Beware of predictions like "The volcano will erupt tomorrow!" Don't follow the preacher because of such statements that come true. 
soc.religion.christian	 I heard the same thing, but without confirmation that he actually said it. It was just as alarming to us as to you; the Bible says that nobody knows when the second coming will take place. 
soc.religion.christian	 I am extremely uncomfortable with this way of phrasing it. God's love is unconditional, unqualified, unfathomable. We are capable of rejecting God's love but He never fails to love us. 
soc.religion.christian	 On the one hand there are advantages to having the liturgy stay the same. John has described some of these. On the other hand, some people seem to start tuning out `the same old words' and pay attention better when things get changed around. I think innovative priests and liturgy committees are trying to get our attention and make things more meaningful for us. It drives me crazy too. 
soc.religion.christian	 I am glad that I am not an atheist. It seems tragic that some people choose a meaningless existence. How terrible to go on living only because one fears death more than life. I feel so sorry for Eric and yet any attempts to share my joy in life with him would be considered as further evidence of the infectious nature of Christianity. 
soc.religion.christian	 The story I related is one of the seven apparitions approved by our Church as worthy of belief. It happened in La Salle, France. 
soc.religion.christian	 Must there be a "why" to this? I ask because of what you also assume about God-- namely, that He just exists, with no "why" to His existence. So the question is reversed, "Why can't we assume the universe just exists as you assume God to "just exist"? Why must there be a "why" to the universe?" 
soc.religion.christian	 If possible (last I heard, it was out of print but they were considering reprinting) read Barbara Hambly's _Search the Seven Hills_. It is historical fiction, set in Rome at the time of the early Church. She captures the weirdness of the early Christians and yet gives glimpses of the holiness too. Some of their odd views make a lot more sense in the context of the society they lived in. I found it a remarkably positive view of Christianity considering that the author is not a Christian herself. Another plus is that each chapter begins with an original-source quote so that it makes a good starting point for serious research. 
soc.religion.christian	 If you would bother to check in any good dictioanry or thesaurus, I think you will find that "arrogance" has to do with an offensive exhibition of presumed or real superiority (a paraphrase from my own Webster's). Arrognace is about pride and haughtiness. A person can believe in absolute truth, even blindly (whatever that means) without being obnoxious about it. Just as a person can be a "humble," authority-questioning, defying-any-theist-to-reply athiest and be quite arrogant. Arrogance is not about what you believe, it is about how you relate to what you believe and how you present it to others. If your overwhelming experience of Christians has been that they are arrogant, I apologozing both for myself and on the behalf of those who have offfended you. But my own experience, at least in forums like Usenet where you see a good mix of people, is that arrogant Christians and athiests seems to occur in about equal numbers. 
soc.religion.christian	 It is told in the Gospels that the Pharisees (sp.?) and scribes bribed the Roman soldiers to say that the Diciples stole his body in the night. Good enough excuse for the Jewish and Roman objectives (of that day). 
soc.religion.christian	 Subject pretty much says it all - I'm looking for Johnny Hart's (creator of the B.C. comic stip) mailing address. 
soc.religion.christian	 On 12-Apr-93 in Environmentalism and paganism user Michael Covington@aisun3 writes: I would like to see Christians devote a bit less effort to _bashing_ paganism and more to figuring out how to present the Gospel to pagans. 
soc.religion.christian	 I simply wish to thank Dave Mielke (dave@bnr.ca) for sharing the tract concerning God's love. It was most welcome to me and a great source of comfort. 
soc.religion.christian	 On Palm Sunday at our parish, we were "invited" to take the role of Jesus in the Passion. I declined to participate. Last year at the liturgy meeting I pointed out how we crucify Christ by our sins, so therefore it is appropriate that we retain the role of the crowd, but to no avail. 
soc.religion.christian	 Dean Velasco quoted a letter from James M Stowell, president of Moody Bible Institute: 
soc.religion.christian	 Perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then. To me, an absolute is something that is constant across time, culture, situations, etc. True in every instance possible. Do you agree with this definition? I think you do: 
soc.religion.christian	 According to what I have read on Biblical idioms, speaking "in X's name" is a standard Aramaic/Hebrew legal idiom for what we today would call Power of Attorney. A person from Jesus' culture authorized to conduct business "in John's name" had full authority over John's financial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to work only for John's benefit and consonant with John's wishes. It was not required for the steward to preface each business transaction with "in John's name"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney and be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal and religious definitions of "faith".) 
soc.religion.christian	 One of the things I find intersting about pagan beliefs is their belief in a feminine deity as well as a masculine deity. Being brought up in a Christian household, I often wondered if there was God the Father, where was the mother? Everyone I know who has a father usually as a mother. It just seemed rather unbalanced to me. Fortunately, my own personal theology, which will probably not fall into line with a lot others, recognized God as a being both without gender and posessing qualities of both genders, as being both a masculine and feminine force. It provides a sense of balance I find sorely lacking in most theologies, a lack which I think is responsible for a lot of the unbalanced ways in which we see the world and treat each other. 
soc.religion.christian	 could easily be interpreted as being sarcastic. They are not. I have written this reply in the most even-handed manner that I can, with no emotions boiling to the surface as it was written. Please accept this as a serious attempt to foster dialog and rest assurred that I make every attempt to make fun of no one, except myself ;-)] 
soc.religion.christian	 I disagree with your claim that Jews were not evangelistic (except in the narrow sense of the word). Jewish proselytism was widespread. There are numerous accounts of Jewish proselytism, both in the New Testament and in Roman and Greek documents of the day. 
soc.religion.christian	 The concept of God as a teacher is indeed interesting. Does He grade on a curve, does He cheat? That is interesting. Not to mention thought provoking. My own concept is that He is a Father and we are His children. In that He loves us, with a love that we can never understand until we are with Him. The Bible says that He looks on the heart as the final measure. From that perspective, in a grading context, the heart is the final test. Specifically, most Christians would agree that there is only one Heaven and one Hell. From that perspective, it is Heaven or Hell. You either go to one or the other. The "grading" on a pass/fail basis is done by God the Father with intervention by Jesus the Son. Not by others. For only God sees the heart. The Bible says of the heart, "...who can know it." I would say there has always been, and always be, an unchanging method. That is what makes a relationship with Christ so secure. In an uncertain and ever changing landscape He is always the same. Yesterday, today and tomorrow. Concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as part of the test, my own conviction is no. Were that the case I certainly wouldn't be going to Heaven. The Bible speaks very plainly about the love and care Jesus had for and about children. The reality is that we are all children. Some of us just have bigger bodies and grey hair. But the Father, our Father is always there. Like most Fathers He wants only the best for His own. There maybe decipline, but there is more love. It's sometimes looks like Christianity is a test, to see who makes it and who doesn't. Those who do pass=Heaven, and those who don't go to the other place. But it is really much more than that... There are few experts. Most of us are just travelers looking for the light and the way Home. Praying that we can bring others with us. 
soc.religion.christian	 Why is it that we have this notion that God takes some sort of pleasure from punishing people? The purpose of hell is to destroy the devil and his angels. 
soc.religion.christian	 This is an excellent question and I'll be anxious to see if there are any such cases. I doubt it. In the medieval period (esp. 10th-cent. when Aquinas flourished) argument was a useful tool because everyone "knew the rules." Today, when you can't count on people knowing even the basics of logic or seeing through rhetoric, a good argument is often indistinguishable from a poor one. 
soc.religion.christian	 seanna@bnr.ca (Seanna (S.M.) Watson) asks: What is the objection to celebration of Easter? 
soc.religion.christian	 I just about closed this once before. I'm now doing so for real, after tonight's posting. 
soc.religion.christian	 Several recent posts have identified the English word 'Easter' with the Babylonian goddess 'Ishtar'. 
soc.religion.christian	 itself is a lunar holiday, not a solar one, and thus falls over a wide possible span of times. The few times that Easter does not fall during or after Passover are because Easter is further linked to the Vernal Equinox- the beginning of spring. 
soc.religion.christian	 How is a scriptural Levitical priesthood resumed? Are there any Jews who can legitimately prove their Levite bloodline? 
soc.religion.christian	 Tsk.tsk. Too much argument on non-issues ! I'm Roman Catholic and it seems to me that people celebrate Easter and Christmas for itself rather than how it relates to Jesus. I don't really care about some diety. If people have some other definition of Easter, then that's their business. Don't let it interfere with my Easter. 
soc.religion.christian	 I have been looking for a book that specifically addresses the mystery of God in the paradox. I have read some that touch on the subject in a chapter but would like a more detailed read. 
soc.religion.christian	 I would like to get your opinions on this: when exactly does an engaged couple become "married" in God's eyes? Some say that if the two have publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective qualifier) they are married/joined in God's sight. 
soc.religion.christian	 I have a few minor problems with the article posted as proof of Christ's resurrection. 
soc.religion.christian	 Yes, I do agree with your definition. My use of the term "always" is rather deceptive, I admit. 
soc.religion.christian	 Hmmm. Here's food for thought: " ...but rather be in fear of him who can destroy both soul and body in gehenna." Math 10:28 
soc.religion.christian	 Years ago I grabbed the following from the net - maybe from this newsgroup. Does anyone know of a source for whether this is an accurate quote? Thanks! Bartletts leaves out the homosexual lines, but they were one of the groups the Nazis tried to exterminate. 
soc.religion.christian	 I don't meant to defend Eric Molas- I find it somewhat annoying when someone pops up on alt.atheism to tell us all about his (usually atheistic) beliefs, so I can certainly see how Christians might be annoyed- but I'd like to point out a few things. 
soc.religion.christian	 I just started reading the group. I was wondering if someone could re-post exactly what the Prophetic Warning to NYC was. 
soc.religion.christian	 There has been some talk recently of Latin rites from the early Church used to bless same-sex unions.If anyone has any idea where copies of these rites exist (in whole or in part), please notify me by e-mail. (I understand that similar ceremonies written in Slavonic exist as well. Let me know where I can find these.) It doesn't matter whether the Latin rite is in the original or a translation. However, I would prefer to have an English version of the Slavon- ic rite, if it exists. Thanks in advance. 
soc.religion.christian	 Darius Let me suggest this. Maybe those who believe in the eternal Darius hell theory should provide all the biblical evidence they can Darius find for it. Stay away from human theories, and only take Darius into account references in the bible. 
soc.religion.christian	 First of all, I resent your assumption that you know why I am threatened by science, or even that I am threatened at all, although I admit the latter. The reason I am threatened by Science has nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lord's existence-- God reveals Himself in many ways, including, to some degree, Science. 
soc.religion.christian	 The last sentence is ironic, since so many readers of Josh McDowell and C.S. Lewis. The above also expresses a rather odd sense of history. What makes you think the masses in Aquinas' day, who were mostly illiterate, knew any more about rhetoric and logic than most people today? If writings from the period seem elevated consider that only the cream of the crop, so to speak, could read and write. If everyone in the medieval period "knew the rules" it was a matter of uncritically accepting what they were told. 
soc.religion.christian	 I heard the same thing, but without confirmation that he actually said it. It was just as alarming to us as to you; the Bible says that nobody knows when the second coming will take place. 
soc.religion.christian	 I agree with Carol here. Determining absolutes is, practically speaking, a waste of time. And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative. 
soc.religion.christian	 One of the Laws of Nature, specifying cause and effect seems to dictate (at least to this layman's mind) there must be a causal event. No reasonable alternative exists. 
soc.religion.christian	 No the members of the first group are not necessarily arrogant. But when I ask them if they are absolutely certain that the volcano will erupt, I expect them to say so "No, but I've chosen to believe some knowledgable people who have determined that the volcano will erupt," rather than, "Yes, I am absolutely certain." When it comes to religious discussions, arrogance or at best naivete is reflected in the latter type of statement. 
soc.religion.christian	 I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the net. My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in schism or legitimately excommunicated. But that's really beside the point. What does the Roman Catholic church say? Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as provided for in canon law. 
soc.religion.christian	 I appreciate if anyone can point out some good books about the dead sea scrolls of Qumran. Thanks in advance. 
soc.religion.christian	 I read somewhere, I think in Morton Smith's _Jesus the Magician_, that old Lazarus wasn't dead, but going in the tomb was part of an initiation rite for a magi-cult, of which Jesus was also a part. It appears that a 3-day stay was normal. I wonder .... ? 
soc.religion.christian	 I do recall Watt making a comment to this effect, though it was quite a few years back and I can't cite the specifics. I also recall that Cecil Andrus, who was Secretary of the Interior during the Carter Administration, responded to Watt's comments by pointing out the stewardship role that God gave to man, as recorded in Genesis. Which makes me wonder: who are the true conservatives? It seems to me that a *conservative* should want to *conserve* things of value for long-term societal benefit. This form of *conservation* should logically extend to the physical environment in which people live, as well as the moral environment in which they relate to one another and to God. 
soc.religion.christian	 As a former Catholic and now as a very active Lutheran - it is some of the "innovations" of the Mass which made me leave the Catholic Church and return to the more traditional Catholic Chuch - the Lutherans. 
soc.religion.christian	 Hi, Does anyone know anything about this group and what they do? Any info would be appreciated. Thanks! 
soc.religion.christian	 The book is called "27 basic fundamental beliefs" or something very close to that. the number *IS* 27, not 30. I have a copy at home (i'm away at school.) 
soc.religion.christian	 The N A T I O N A L D A Y o f P R A Y E R 
soc.religion.christian	 First, I would like to thank all who sent me their opinions on the matter at hand. All advice was taken to heart, if not directly used. My friend found out about the matter quite accidently. After reading some of my mail, I quit from the mail reader & went about my business. I must have trashed my mail improperly, because he got on the same terminal the next day & saw my old messages. He thought they were responses to a post he placed in alt.atheism earlier that week, so he read some of them before realizing that they were for me. I got a message from him the next day; he apologized for reading my mail & said that he did not want to appear to be a snoop. He said that he would be willing to talk to me about his views & didn't mind doing so, especially with a friend. So we did. I neither changed his mind nor did he change mine, as that was not the point. Now he knows where I'm coming from & now I know where he's coming from. And all that I can do is pray for him, as I've always done. 
soc.religion.christian	 okay to create a child if you aren't able to be a good parent?", I am reminded of a "speech" by one of the characters (I can't remember which) in the movie "Parenthood". [I am WAY to liberal with my quotation marks tonight...] 
soc.religion.christian	 That is not necessarily unorthodox. When Christians call God 'Father', we are using a metaphor. The Bible in one place refers to God as being like a mother. God is neither a father nor a mother in the literal sense; God has some of the attributes of both; the father metaphor is usually used because (for most people at most times) it is the less misleading of the two possibilities. 
soc.religion.christian	 He who overcomes will inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will be my son. 
soc.religion.christian	 I agree with what Darren has to say here, but would like to add a personal observation. What I see as arrogance and the problem I have with it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for others who come to differing conclusions. Clearly, this is not just Christian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems within Christianity. I do not tend to argue with others about matters of personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by objective means. 
soc.religion.christian	 That argument would be more compelling if it were not for the Ishtar eggs and Ishtar bunnies. Why mix pagan fertility symbols from the worship of the pagan goddess of fertility with Biblical belief? What would really be lost if all of you were to just drop the word "Easter" and replace all such occurances with "Resurrection Sunday"? Would you not show up for services if they were called "Resurrection Sunday Services" rather than "Easter Services"? 
soc.religion.christian	 I agree. God makes the husband the head of the house. But he surely can't do it alone. He needs the help of his beloved wife whom the Lord gave him. 
soc.religion.christian	 Considerably better than I feel about, say, the Punic Wars, or the Peloponnesian War (spelling optional), or almost any other event in classical history. How close to the events do you think the oldest extent manuscripts are in those cases? 
soc.religion.christian	 Hello, I am about to embark on a bible study on ACTS. I have online bible software with me. I would like to know the the background of the authors of its various topics articles and about the author of the People's New Testament. I need to know how realible is the articles in the Online Bible software. Specifically (for your convenience) I want to know about the : 
soc.religion.christian	 o.k. i don't follow god "blindly". once, long ago, i questioned authority to such a rabid point that i found question_authority=reject_authority_ _unquestioningly. i question authority all the time. but to forever question is fruitless...eventually we have to consider whether there are answers to the questions, whether the "authority" {say, the bible in this case} has validity. basically to question authority does not necessarily mean reject authority. 
soc.religion.christian	 The problem you see here is that some Christians claim things about the Bible which they don't actually believe or practice. I've known all sorts of Christians, ranging from the trendiest of liberals to the fire-breathing fundamentalists, and although many on the conservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible is a (perhaps *the*) source of absolute truth, I don't know of anyone who treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition. While I am not a Roman Catholic, I believe this is close to the official position of the RC church (perhaps an RC would like to comment). 
soc.religion.christian	 First of all, God does not take any sort of pleasure from punishing people. He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on whom he will have compassion (Ex 33:19). However, if he enjoyed punishing people and sending them to hell, then why would he send Jesus to "seek and save that which was lost" (Luke 19:10)? 
soc.religion.christian	 Let's get back to basics. Canon (from the latin) means a rule. If we say that a rule is open then its a rule made to be broken. There is an issue also of measurement against a rule. Thus the words that are spoken need to be compared against the rule/canon but not added to the canon. 
soc.religion.christian	 Coming from a long line of "hot tempered" people, I know temper when I see it. One of the tell tale signs/fruits that give non-christians away - is when their net replies are acrid, angry and sarcastic. 
soc.religion.christian	 Oh contrer mon captitan! There is a way. Certainly it is not by human reason. Certainly it is not by human experience. (and yet it is both!) To paraphrase Sartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point. It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing. Your logic comes to fruition in relativism. 
soc.religion.christian	 Sorry for bothering with a request almost irrelevant to anyone except for me: Could some kind soul provide me with the phone number of wycliffe center horsley green high wycomb bucks hp 14 3 xl I want to surprise a friend of mine staying there, but I don't have the number. 
soc.religion.christian	 How much better to get wisdom than gold, to choose understanding rather than silver!

soc.religion.christian	 Having met Peter Kingston (of WBT) some years back, he struck me as an exemplery and dedicated Christian whose main concern was with translation of the Word of God and the welfare of the people group he was serving. WBT literature is concerned mainly with providing Scripture in minority languages. 
soc.religion.christian	 Hello. Firstly, what do you exactly mean by "fundamentalist"? I will for the time being assume that what you mean is that your friend believes that the bible is God's word to mankind? I suspect that what happened to him is what he'll call being "born again"? Anyway, was that recent? If the answer is "yes" to all the questions above, it is quite understandable. However, IMO, I'ld rather give advice to your friend! I think I've been through something similar to him, and one thing I can say is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying to communicate from different worldviews. Why he talks about those things is because they are now "obvious" to him. What is "obvious" to him is not obvious to you. Secondly, why he may be very persuasive is because from his point of view, he has been on "both sides of the fence". This I mean that before he turned "fundamentalist", you two are agreeable because both of you see things from the same side. If suddenly, as if a new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him, it is like the discovery of let's say a new continent, or a new planet. To him, he's got to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than where he was, and what he thinks is much better than where you are now. You have got to realise that from his point of view, he means well to you, eventhough he may end up offending you. To him, it is worth that risk. Nevertheless, it is really up to him to respect where you stand and listen to you as well. At this moment, it may be difficult because he is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet about, however, he may not realise that he's really putting you off. 
soc.religion.christian	 I don't know if this is the sort of thing you guys like to discuss. I guess it falls into the area of apologetics. 
soc.religion.christian	 It is interesting that you posted those lyrics, because just the other day I was thinking of doing the same. I like those lyrics, since whenever I am approached by judgemental, pharisitical, evangelical fundamentalists who throw the Bible at me because I have long hair, wear a black leather jacket, and listen to Black Sabbath, I have something to throw back. Usually their chins drop and they come up speechless over those not very satanic lyrics. 
soc.religion.christian	 I am sorry you find these charges amusing, Mark. I understand your frustration though--it can be kind of scary to find your assumptions challenged. Some of the specific cultural interference to which I refer includes linguistic manipulation, for instance, their Tzotzil-Spanish dictionary removed both Spanish and Tzotzil words for concepts which are threatening to the ruling ideology, e.g., class, conquer, exploitation, repression, revolution, and described words which can express ideological concepts in examples like "Boss--the boss is good. He treats us well and pays us a good wage." As some of my students would say, "NOT!" Your tone implies that you are unlikely to believe me--indeed, why should you? If you are interested enough to do some further research though, and you sound as if you are, here are some references for you. 
soc.religion.christian	 Hooray ! I always suspected that I was human too :-) It is the desire to be like Christ that often causes christians to be very critical of themselves and other christians. We are supposed to grow, mature, endeavour to be Christ-like but we are far far far from perfect. Build up the body of Christ, don't tear it down, and that includes yourself. Jesus loves me just the way I am today, tomorrow and always (thank God ! :-).

soc.religion.christian	 I agree that there is truth in scripture. There are principles to be learned from it. Claiming that that truth is absolute, though, seems to imply a literal reading of the Bible. If it were absolute truth (constant across time, culture, etc.) then no interpretation would be necessary. 
soc.religion.christian	 I beg to disagree with the assertion that science is a collection of models. Scientific models are a game to play, and are only as good as the assumptions and measurements (if any) that go into them. 
soc.religion.christian	 Hello all. We are doing a bible study (at my college) on Revelations. We have been doing pretty good as far as getting some sort of reasonable interpretation. We are now on chapters 17 and 18 which talk about the woman on the beast and the fall of Babylon. I believe the beast is the Antichrist (some may differ but it seems obvious) and the woman represents Babylon which stands for Rome or the Roman Catholic Church. What are some views on this interpretation? Is the falling Babylon in chapter 18 the same Babylon in as in chapter 17? The Catholic church? Hate to step on toes. thanks

"We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come." - Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed. You will have both body and soul in hell - eventually. 
soc.religion.christian	 My brother has been alienated from my parents and me since shortly after his marriage to a domineering and insecure woman, about twelve years ago. We've kept things on a painfully polite, Christmas-card sort of level for most of this time. Attempts to see each other end disastrously, with his wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined slights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, this'll happen by the end of a single restaurant meal). He seems, from what I've seen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keep the next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact with us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is his choice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But it's hard. From time to time I've wanted to drop the pretense that we have a relationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painful relationship, by talking honestly with him, but I've always thought, "Why be dramatic? And you know he'll only get evasive and then find some excuse to get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides to come back." It's been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go on with the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best I could think of. Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn't going to pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was the outcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and raved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, and in which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation was beyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all the allowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would not quietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of their relationship, she didn't want to talk to or see them any more. And she hung up. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this is the first time she's ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as if she's divorced my brother, and that it's a relief in some ways to have the break out in the open and done with. 
soc.religion.christian	 Please forgive all the inclusions. I suppose they are neccessary to follow the argument. 
soc.religion.christian	 The basic problem with your argument is your total and complete reliance on the biblical text. Luke's account is highly suspect (I would refer you to the hermeneia commentary on Acts). Moreover Luke's account is written at least 90 years after the fact. In the meantime everyone he mentions has died and attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come up with only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established. Moreover, Pauls account of some of the events in Acts (as recorded in Galatians) fail to establish the acts accounts. 
soc.religion.christian	 We also cannot fail to note the intense suffering a devastation which has been wrecked on our world because of Christians -- who were certain they were following Christ. From Captialist who have polluted the enviorment in strict obedience to the Gensis command to subdue the earth, to Nazi's who have "justly" punished the Jews for the killing Christ (as well as the other progroms), the innocent women who were burned alive in accordance with "you shall not allow a witch to live", the Moslems who were killed in the Crusades, the god-fearing men destroyed by the inquistion. The religious wars in Spain, France, England, etc. Christianity has undoubtedly caused the most suffering and needless loss of life by individuals whose certainity that they were following the instructions therein, was unquestionable. There is much to grieve. 
soc.religion.christian	 And how come we don't pass out bullet-proof vests in school to promote safe gun usage? 
soc.religion.christian	 Here again, the problem with most of the individuals posting here, you take the biblical account as though it were some sort of historical recounting in the modern sense. I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That Spoke_ (Pub. Harper and Row, 1988). The earliest texts which we have make no reference to an empty tomb. Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of resurrection. Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what the point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg's work _Resurrection, Immortality, and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ (Publ Cambridge, Havard Univ. Press, 1972) is most helpful. Look At Rom 1:1-3. Paul here has no need of an empty tomb. Additionally in 1 Cor 15, Here again there is no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised (note the passive), he appeared, no ascension either. 
soc.religion.christian	 There is a certain truth to this statement. Only I would use the word "medicine" instead of drug. With regard to the condition of the human soul, Christianity is first and foremost a healing medicine. It also strengthens and enables one, as healing takes hold, to grow in new strength and health to live and be and to do that for which God created us. 
soc.religion.christian	 If I believed in the God of the bible I would be very fearful of making this statement. Doesn't it say those who judge will be judged by the same measure? 
soc.religion.christian	 Another issue of importance. Was the crucification the will of God or a tragic mistake. I believe it was a tragic mistake. God's will can never be accomplished through the disbelief of man. Jesus came to this world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth. He desperately wanted the Jewish people to accept him as the Messiah. If the crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that this cup pass from him. Was this out of weakness. NEVER. Many men and women have given their lives for their country or other noble causes. Is Jesus less than these. No he is not. He knew the crucification was NOT the will of GOD. God's will was that the Jewish people accept Jesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established on the earth with Jesus as it's head. (Just like the Jewish people expected). If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what kind of world we would live in today. It would be a very different world. And that is eactly what GOD wanted. Men and women of that age could have been saved by following the living Messiah while he was on the earth. Jesus could have established a sinless lineage that would have continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world to live with GOD. Now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have to wait for Christ's return. But when he returns will he be recognized and will he find faith on this earth. Isn't it about time for his return. It's been almost 2000 years. 
soc.religion.christian	 Hi everyone, I'm a commited Christian that is battling with a problem. I know that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds, yet hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless, saying' You fools, do you still think that just believing is enough?' 
soc.religion.christian	 Bill Burns was looking for a description of the differnces between the Catholic and Lutheran churches. 
soc.religion.christian	 Rob Butera asks about a book called THE LOST YEARS OF JESUS, by Elizabeth Clare Prophet. 
soc.religion.christian	 This is done in English (same music as the traditional Latin) in many Anglican parishes. I should expect that many RCC parishes would do likewise. The ST MATTHEW PASSION and ST JOHN PASSION of J S Bach are direct offshoots of this tradition 
soc.religion.christian	 I agree. Where in the Gospels does Jesus advocate any of the actions you mention? 
soc.religion.christian	 A good example of this is Abraham (referred to in the James passage). Hebrews says that Abraham was justified by faith -- but his faith was demonstrated through his works (i.e., he obeyed what God told him to do). 
soc.religion.christian	 Hi... I'm not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame (thanx in advance) 
soc.religion.christian	 Actually I don't think there is any conflict if we really understand what these passages say. First, what is faith? If you study the meaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will come to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere belief. Faith means both trust and action. If you do not put your belief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith. I think this is what James means when he says that "faith without works is dead" and, "I will show you my faith by my works." Remember James was writing to "the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad." This probably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much later and wouldn't understand the meaning of the original Greek. (Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others he intended to reach.) Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the people of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of the Greek. 
soc.religion.christian	 This is a ridiculous argument for being a Christian. So then, you might consider switching from Christianity to another religion if you were offered an even more frightening description of another hell? How many Christians do think there are who view it strictly as an insurance policy? Not many I know; they believe in a message of love and compassion for others. A faith based on fear of hell sounds like a dysfunctional relationship with God. Like a child who cringes in fear of a parent's physical violence. 
soc.religion.christian	 And the Lord's servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.

soc.religion.christian	 I agree that we'll probably never agree, and I'm starting to feel frustrated, and I'm tired of having my conversations with my husband dominated by this topic (just kidding, :-)). 
soc.religion.christian	 One rule of thumb is that if a person is making the claim, they are wrong. I was just reading John 14 this morning (I think that is the right chapter, anyway it is close and I don't have a Bible at work to check with.) and in it Jesus is talking to his disciples about his impending death and he says that he will be going away and then later he will be with them. He said something along the lines of "I will be in you and you will be in me." (Again I cannot provide the exact quote or citation.) Anyway, my understanding of this is that the Second Coming will not be an outward event. It is an inward event, Christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in him. If you look for a person you will be deceived. 
soc.religion.christian	 The people who post to this particular newsgroup are either too cowardly, too arrogant, or too apathetic to discuss this issue since I have yet to see any discussion grace my computer screen. While it holds PARTICULAR interest to the African-American community, everyone has something to gain from discussing it. As any knowledgable person should know, Christianity has been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mental hold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of African-Americans. This was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus in slave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners. It wasn't enough that the slaveowner was your provider, but he was also your GOD, to be looked upon with unconditional love & loyalty and to be worshipped with great pride. But how culturally & biblically accurate are these icons? Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in European countries, as that of a Black Madonna. But what about Biblical physical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool, His feet to that of brass? And think about the area of the world where all Biblical actions took place. I welcome all intelligent commentary on this important topic; flamers need not reply. 
soc.religion.christian	 Yes, he was. He also played Jesus in "Jesus Christ Superstar" before he became a Christian. He played in Black Sabbath right after he first got saved, but then left it. 
soc.religion.christian	 I've heard it said that the accounts we have of Christs life and ministry in the Gospels were actually written many years after the event. (About 40 years or so). Is this correct?? If so, why the big time delay?? I know all scripture is inspired of God, so the time of writing is I suppose un-important, but I still can't help be curious! 
soc.religion.christian	 This is to let you know that the fourth issue of the Copt-Net Newsletter has been issued. The highlights of this issue include: 
soc.religion.christian	 I finished reading a very good book, "The Will of God", Weatherhead. This was very helpful to me in applying thought to the subject of the will of God. 
soc.religion.christian	 Yes, but Jeff also speaks out against listening to bands like Black Sabbath. He says they're into all sorts of satanic stuff. I don't know. 
soc.religion.christian	 excellent question timothy. i hpoe the answers you get will be satisfactory as we can not understand the mind of god. but to attempt to answer you clearly. GOD of the Bible has given us humans relativly little about how he intends to judge mankind. the first test is those who have beleived that Jesus Christ is the Son of GOD and that his death and resurrection was sufficent to serve justice for all the acts we commit that are wrong in the eyes of god, the bible calls this sin. for those who die before the end of the world/have already died it is more complicated to explain without lapsing in to cliche. God must judge people on the baasis of their works in this world. however there is no plus and minus system for GOD. he has declared that he can not tolerate spiritual imperfection, thus he can only based your worthiness to live with him on the wrong in your life. Good people, yes even Christians are going to constantly sin before GOD, The Christian hoever thanks GOD that Christ has given his life for his sin's penalty. the proscribed punishment for sin is death, just as the proscribed punishment for robbery is time in jail. God then cannot ask for anything but punishement for those sins. He does not want to condem. the Bible says in John 3:17, that God did not send his son in to the word to condem it but that through him it might be saved." when i realize that i have sinned, and i do with painful regularity, i must approach GOD and ask him to not hold thew sin against me, i have that right and privlige only because of Christ. as for Jews they are promised that they must believe on the Messiah who would come, and dis come in Jesus of Nazereth. Muslims, i fear have been given a lie from the fater of lies, Satan. They need Christ as do us all. for those who don't have that right, in the view of the bible they stand olone in their defense. are you going to hell? i can not answer that for you. i can only say that perhaps it is eaiser to ask and answer how can i not go to Hell? that step is much more rewarding. 
soc.religion.christian	 Are you suggesting that God supports genocide? Perhaps the Germans were "punishing" Jews on God's behalf? 
soc.religion.christian	 The next time you go to church, you can check the better creed, that is, the Apostles' Creed. It says: "the resurrection of the body." Should have learned that on the first go around. But what's a body without a little bit a'soul? 
soc.religion.christian	 believeing blindly or not. I'm not sure how blindness comes into it. I do not deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions from evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on the evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the rather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere is not self explanatory). 
soc.religion.christian	 The big-bang model supposes a temporal singularity at the point of origin. There was _no_ time for a prior cause to occur in. If you want to invent fables for the surrounding context, fine, but one fable is only as good as any other. Why should I prefer to believe in a God that _just_ exists, as opposed to a singularity that _just happened_, or giant puce subspace iguanas, that fling universes off their tongues like gobs of spit? 
soc.religion.christian	 From article <Apr.15.00.58.22.1993.28891@athos.rutgers.edu, by ruthless@panix.com (Ruth Ditucci): Coming from a long line of "hot tempered" people, I know temper when I see it. One of the tell tale signs/fruits that give non-christians away - is when their net replies are acrid, angry and sarcastic. 
soc.religion.christian	 I have seen Jeff Fenholt speak and I didn't find him judgemental. I think that the wording for that add was certainly inappropriate, but I think they were trying to say that headbangers would like the program. But I would NOT put headbangers in the same class as alcholics, etc. it is condescending. And I believe that Jeff was wearing black when I saw him. 
soc.religion.christian	 Over the years, I have met Christians who are not associated with any local church and are not members of any local church. This is an issue that may be very personal, but is important. What does the Bible say about this and how can we encourage our friends with regard to this issue? 
soc.religion.christian	 Where do insparations/Miracles fit in? I was a new reader to the bible and Qu'ran at the same time in my life and I can tell you that I would have drifted in my faith if Those books were not exposed to me. 
soc.religion.christian	 I have received tons of mail from people replying to this article I wrote, and I would just like to thank everyone who took the time to give me a hand. It has indeed helped me and re-affirmed alot of theories that I held but was a little unsure about. 
soc.religion.christian	 Perhaps it would be useful to ask whether those doing the ethnic cleansing could be said to be loving those they are killing in the very act of killing. Does it reflect the attitude of God, who sends rain to both the just and the unjust? If not, then Christians should be uncomfortable with it. Jesus gave his followers the law of love to follow and it is by exhibiting this that disciples will be known. Doctrinal (or political) correctness is not the standard, so I don't see why Christians should be moved against the Serbs because their ancestors converted from Christianity to Islam. It seems to me that as a Christian you _should_ be troubled by the ethnic cleansing. 
soc.religion.christian	 This is an annual time of prayer organized by the Focus on the Family organization. If you have not heard about it on your Christian radio station or at your local church, call them and they may be able to give you the information. 
soc.religion.christian	 Why should he have been any different "then"? Ozzy Osbourne, ex-singer and main character of the Black Sabbath of good ole days past, is and always was a devout catholic. Or so I've heard over on the alt.rock-n-roll.metal newsgroups, an' I figure those folks oughta know.. 
soc.religion.christian	 Seems to me if you learned to differentiate between illusion and reality on your own you wouldn't need to rely on doctrines that need to be updated. My experience of Christianity (25+ years) is that most Christians seek answers from clergymen who have little or no direct experience of spiritual matters, and that most of these questions can be answered by simple introspection. Most people suspect that they cannot trust their senses, but few take the next step to figure out that they can trust themselves. Not to get too esoteric, but it seems that most religions, Christianity included, are founded by particularly intuitive people who understand this. 
soc.religion.christian	 Ah and how...??? Amen to that one!!!!!! Thanks Chuck for sharing... after all, no one can serve two masters...God and money...... after all, the preciousness of God as Lord and Savior is far more valuable than being a millionaire will ever be... 
soc.religion.christian	 Was it Pascal, or maybe Descartes, who first used this figure of speech? I seem to have some vague recollections from reading some of their essays, but I certainly couldn't say it was one of them for sure. 
soc.religion.christian	 Can the Father possibly not hear the words of His children. Of course He hears all your prayers. Whether you are a sinner or a saint, no questions. The real question you should be asking is: "Does sin block OUR hearing His answer?" And the answer to that question is a resounding YES. To paraphrase the gospel "Many are called but few choose to listen" and so it is with prayer. 
soc.religion.christian	 Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins. 
soc.religion.christian	 This is not true. The athiest's position is that there is no PROOF of the existence of God. As much as some people accept their Church, their priests or straight from their own scriptures as the "proof", this does not satisfy atheists. 
soc.religion.christian	 I haven't followed whatever discussion there may have been on these people, but I feel that C. S. Lewis is an excellent apologist and I see no reason for embarrassment. If you think that errors and flawed arguments are a reason for dismissing a thinker, you must dismiss nearly every thinker from Descartes to Kant; any philosophy course will introduce you to their weaknesses. 
soc.religion.christian	 I'd recommend McDowell's "Evidence that Demands a Verdict" books (3 I think) and Manfred Brauch's "Hard Sayings of Paul". He also may have done "Hard Sayings of Jesus". My focus would be for a new Christian to struggle with his faith and be encouraged by the historical evidence, especially one who comes from a background which emphasizes knowable faith. 
soc.religion.christian	 Not if they are unwilling to go through a public marriage ceremony, nor if they say they are willing but have not actually done so. 
soc.religion.christian	 Here in America people tend to think of choosing a church much like they think of choosing a car or a country club. What I mean is that our culture is such that we tend towards satisfying our own wants rather than considering things with others in mind and not making prayer an initial and primary part of the decision process. People tend to treat church as they would a club and when something is less than to their liking, off they go to another one. 
soc.religion.christian	 And yet, Jayne, as we read the Gospels and in particular the topics that Jesus himself spoke on, Hell figures in a large % of the time -certainly more than heaven itself. Paul, as we learn in I Thess, taught new believers and new churches eschatology and did not hesitate to teach hell and damnation. Rev, chapter 20:11-15 is very specific and cannot be allegorized. I think the word "throne" is used 45 times in Rev and that the unbelieving come to receive the assignment of the severity of judgement, for in John 3 we read that they are already judged. Rom 3 speaks that every mouth will be shut. There is no recourse, excuse or defense. 
soc.religion.christian	 one case changed the order of his contributions) in order to clarify the historical relationship of the views. My comments are based primarily on William Rusch's historical summary in "The Trinitarian Controversy", Fortress. I'm going to save this as an FAQ. --clh] 
soc.religion.christian	 Are any readers of s.r.c. going to the Love Europe congress in Germany this July? 
soc.religion.christian	 Desiree Bradley (Desiree_Bradley@mindlink.bc.ca) asked us whether we should think of the Serbs as doing God's work in Bosnia. I've refrained from posting, in hope that someone who is more familiar with the OT than I would answer. But at this point I feel I have to say something. 
soc.religion.christian	 But someone will say, "You have faith; I have deeds." Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do. 
soc.religion.christian	 It just goes to show that not all evangelical fundamentalists are pharisitical! I wear a black leather jacket, like classic rock, but no longer have the long locks I once had. However, I too rely upon the Bible as a basis for Christian ethics. 
soc.religion.christian	 Will, there has been a lot of discussion going on about this over in s.r.c.b-s. I will make the case here though and try to help you out: 
soc.religion.christian	 First by his fruits. The messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth. He also comes to first reveal the root cause of original sin (fallen nature) and then provide a means to cut the connection to that original sin. He also wants to create world peace based on Godism. The messiah's teachings will build on the foundation of the Bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of God, the fall of man, the purpose of creation, and God's providence of restoration. It will also provide a foundation for the unity of all the World's religions. 
soc.religion.christian	 I am a student at UW-Eau Claire. I am doing a paper an witches and wanted to get your point of view. I will not use you name unless you specifically tell me to do so. 
soc.religion.christian	 The analogy does not depend on the premisses being true, because the question under discussion is not truth but arrogance. 
soc.religion.christian	 Pardon me for being a little confused, but at the beginning of your second paragraph, you say, "God has one set of rules for all his people," yet at the end of the same paragraph you declare, "please do not combine the ceremonial and moral laws in one." Not only do I not understand where in the Bible you find the declaration that there are 2 laws (ceremonial and moral), but I am also unclear on whether you think it is bad to have 2 sets of laws in the first place. If it's bad to have 2 sets of laws, how can there be a ceremonial law that is different from the moral law (and vice versa)? 
soc.religion.christian	 I strongly disagree that absolute truth would not require interpretation. That's because truth may be absolute, but it may not be obvious. Like so many things, the truth is always subject to misinterpretation. 
soc.religion.christian	 Despite my trendy, liberal, feminist tendencies and the fact that I basically agree with what you are saying I will rebut: 
soc.religion.christian	 I've just read Carol's response and I just had to get into this. I've got some verses which are not subject to interpretation because they say what they say. They are 2 Peter 1:20-21, 2 Timothy 3:16-17, and Galatians 1:11-12. 
soc.religion.christian	 Please, define cell church. I missed it somewhere in the past when this was brought up before. 
soc.religion.christian	 Of course if this question was asked in a group dealing with economics, the answer would be that the cause of war was economic. My observations over the past 30 years (and not withstanding a little history reading beside) is that while religious differences do play a part in many of the conflicts, so does (unfortunately) race, economics and any other items that identify one group of men as being different from another. 
soc.religion.christian	 Julie, it is a really trying situation that you have described. My brother was living with someone like that and things were almost as bad (although he left after a considerably shorter amount of time due to other problems with the relationship). Anyway, the best thing to do would be to get everyone in the same room together (optimally in a room with nothing breakable), lock the door behind you, throw the key out underneath the door (just as far as the longest hand can reach. You would like to get out after the conclusion, I would imagine), and hash things out. More than likely, there will be screaming, crying, and possibly hitting (unless of course someone decided to bring some rope to tie people down). Some of the best strategies in keeping things calmer would include: have each individual own their own statements (ie, I feel that this relationship is hurting everyone involved because.... or I really don't understand where you're coming from.) reinforce statements by paraphrasing, etc. (ie, So you think that we did this because of...? Well, let me just say that the reason for this was ....) don't accuse each other (It was your fault that ... happened!) find a common ground about SOMETHING (Lampshades really are decorational and functional at the same time.) Guaranteed, in a situation like this, there is going to be some gunnysacking (re-hashing topics which were assumed resolved, but were truly not and someone feels someone else is to blame). However, this should be kept to a minimum and simply ask for forgiveness or apologize about each situation WITHOUT holding a smoldering grudge. 
soc.religion.christian	 Actually, there was very little to the book. First of all looking at the titles of her other books, I would personally consider her to be engaged in a bizarre form of Christian-like mysticism heavily influenced by eastern philosphies (great titles like _The_Astrology_of_the_4_Horsemen_). 
soc.religion.christian	 First, I thank collectively all people who have given good answers to my questions. In my follow-up to Jason Smith's posting, I will address some issues that have caused misunderstanding: 
soc.religion.christian	 I don't claim to be an expert on the branch Davidians, but I might know more than most. 
soc.religion.christian	 The reason for the existence of hell is justice. Fear is only an effect of the reality of hell. 
soc.religion.christian	 Yes, in fact Peter is now at Wycliffe HQ in the U.K., and is a member of my church. I would fully endorse the above -- Peter is a very Godly man, with a passion for serving Christ. 
soc.religion.christian	 I have no doubt that God hears everybody's prayers. However, He does things His way, i.e. things will happen only if it is His will. 
soc.religion.christian	 Some years ago an Anglican synod was discussing the marriage canons and there was some debate on what actually constituted a marriage. 
soc.religion.christian	 I'll pose a question here that's got me thinking: what distinguishes "true" religion from cults (I'm speaking generally here, not specifially about Christianity)? Jerry Falwell was on Good Morning America on Tuesday ostensibly to answer this question. Basically, he said that true religion follows a message whereas a cult follows a person. But, then, Christianity is a cult because the message of Christianity IS the person of Jesus. So what distinguishes, for example, the Branch Davidian "cult" from the Presbyterian "church"? Doctrinal differences don't answer the question, IMHO, so don't use them as an answer. 
soc.religion.christian	 Joe, just 'cause you say they aren't subject to interpretation doesn't necesarily make it so. That's *your* *interpretation* of these texts. 
soc.religion.christian	 The Bible does tell us that governments are ordained by God (Romans 13). And furthermore, God foreknows everything that would happen. It is just to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, the inevitablity of the sucess of God's plan, and this is especially hard to grasp when we see governemnts doing evil. However, though they are doing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), it must be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to the final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is possible. In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the eyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts now rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing people for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and Annias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His plan might be accomplished. But don't forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to execute His just judgement upon another. The Romans were used to fulfill the chorus of "Let his blood be upon our hands" of the crowd in Jersualem. And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel, which was inturn gotten by Persia, etc. God does use nations to punish other nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament. Don't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, "Mene, mene, tekel, peres?" Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God's justice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians as their due punishment for their rebellion. Another exammple is the extirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel. The Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and the Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly. I could go on with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is quite clear. Two things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to question why God has ordered the world as He has. In His divine Wisdom, He made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans 9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter. 2) The message of Jesus Christ is as follows: "Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand." Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - "Let the dead bury the dead, come, follow me." There is not an infinite amount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to follow Him and become fishers of men. He does not say, "well, alright, you can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your plans." He said "Follow me." His message is NOT "I'm just a sweety-pie who would never hurt a fly, you've got all the time in the world, and Divine Judgement, that's only a fairy tale." "Our great God and Savior" Jesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the world. And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be questioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy. 
soc.religion.christian	 I see some irony here. Jesus was willing to go through torture to free you from the definite promise of hell (based on Adam/Eve's fall from grace) but rather than allow him to stand in your place, you would give up your redemption to stand with those who do not accept his grace. God would rather have none in hell, which seems to put the burden of choice on us. Of course, this is all fictional anyway since you reject him also. 
soc.religion.christian	 Then by that definition, I would be in a cell church only here at IU, not when the whole group gets together at Indianapolis (950 every week in attendance). 
soc.religion.christian	 Here are some notes about what the church is to be like and some helpful ideas about how to choose a church: 
soc.religion.christian	 i have a question for you all related to this. jesus condemns divorce several times in the new testament, and i have a hard time with this. the catholic church (as far as i can tell) does grant annulments with the statement that the marriage never really existed in God's eyes. (please, if i am mistinterpreting, correct me.) however, i have witnessed marriages where two people were very much in love but recognized that they were destroying themselves and each other by staying in a marriage, and that the problems were due to personal childhood issues that had never been resolved. i ask you, is divorce justified in such a case? they knew who they were, what they were doing, they were deeply in love, but in the end, it did not work out. i must admit that i don't see jesus forcing them to live together, or even condemning that they go and seek happiness with someone else later on. opinions? 
soc.religion.christian	 i'd just like to repeat and emphasize that because someone else is trying to make you feel horrible and worthless does not mean that you should feel that way, although that's easier to say than believe sometimes. remember, God made you and loves you, so he must think you're something special. (excuse the trite language here.) also, the bully may just be someone who is mean for no reason -- not out of intentional mental torture. has anyone else been harassed? maybe they're just not talking about it. 
soc.religion.christian	 just picked out this one point because it struck me.... why do you believe this? muslims believe in many of the same things that christians and jews believe; they believe jesus, while not the messiah, is a prophet. this seems to me to be much closer to christianity than other religions are. (then again i tend to be somewhat liberal about others' beliefs.) 
soc.religion.christian	 I probably should let this pass, it's not worth the time, and it's not really intended for me. But I couldn't resist. A personal weakness of mine. Jerkius Kneeus. Tragically incurable. 
soc.religion.christian	 This subject seems to be incredibly inflammatory. Those who subscribe to _Biblical Archaeology Review_ will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone complained about a Franklin Mint ad. (_BAR_ is a great magazine, but the contrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads is extreme.) In this ad, they were hawking a doll with a head based on the famous bust of Nefertiti, giving the face a typical doll-pink complexion. The letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that Nefertiti was "a beautiful black queen." This set off an exchange of hotheaded letters than ran for several issues, to the point where they had an article from an Egyptologist titled "Was Cleopatra Black?" (The answer to the title is "no"-- she was greek.) 
soc.religion.christian	 I have been looking at some of the recent productions on homosexuality and decided that I was interested in videotaped copies of these. If anyone can help me out here, I would very much appreciate it. 
soc.religion.christian	 If this is God's attitude, then I'll think I'll go along with Terry Pratchett's religious philosophy: 
soc.religion.christian	 Can a theist be truly objective? Can he be impartial when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or will he assume the superstition of his parents when questioning? 
soc.religion.christian	 John, The problem here is that you have taken one peice of my response, without bothering to connect it with the other parts. I have repeatedly noted that one needs to take the problematic historcity of acts and then examine the work of John Dominic Crossan and Burton Mack. Once you have taken the time to examine recent developments in biblical scholarship, I think you will grasp more clearly what I am saying. 
soc.religion.christian	 Hi, I'd like to subscribe to Leadership Magazine but wonder if there is one on disk instead of on paper. Having it on disk would save me retyping illustrations, etc into a word processor. It's just cut and paste. If there are other good Christian magazines like Leadership on disk media, I'd appreciate any info. 
soc.religion.christian	 The following is a survey we are conducting for a term project in a philosophy class. It is not meant to give us anything interesting statistically; we want to hear what kind of voices there are out there. We are not asking for full- blown essays, but please give us what you can. 
soc.religion.christian	 I've sent the article. In terms of the group discussion, I wanted to point out that "non-liberal education" (head in the sand) is not the same as "abstinence education". 
soc.religion.christian	 As a muslim (spelled sometimes as Moslem) I must say that Muslims strong ly believe in Jesus. Refered in islamic text as eesau(as) 
soc.religion.christian	 Just finished reading Burton Mack's new book, _The Lost Gospel, Q and Christian Origins_. I thought it was totally cool. Anyone else read it and want to talk? 
soc.religion.christian	 Jesus was born a Jew. We have biblical accounts of both his mother's ancestry and his father's, both tracing back to David. It seems reasonable to assume, therefore, that Jesus was Semitic.' "As an interesting aside, Jesus' being semitic makes him neither "white" nor "black," and in some sense underscores the point made earlier that his color was not important, it was his message, his grace, and his divinity that we should concentrate on. Finally, I would direct anyone interested in African involvement in the church to the account of the conversion of the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts chapter 9 (I think it's chapter 9). This is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch, treasurer to the queen of the Ethiopians, was definitely African. Because "Ethiopia" at that time indicated a region just south of Egypt, many also speculate that this man was not only the first African Christian, but the first black Christian as well. God bless, Charles Campbell 
soc.religion.christian	 This brings up an interesting subject that has not been discussed much, and probably has not been studied much. 
soc.religion.christian	 Maybe I'm a little tired but I can't seem to follow the logic here. If whatever is held true on earth is held true in heaven how is it that a priest (RC only apparently) is required. 
soc.religion.christian	 To what follows, our moderator has already answered the charge of arrogance more ably that I could have done so, so I will confine myself to answering the charge of illogic. 
soc.religion.christian	 Since Jesus was born in the Middle East, then I expect his human features to be similar to Middle Easterners at that point in time. And since the camera wasn't invented yet we can only guess what he looked like. For example, with all the dinosaur bones we're digging up we still don't know if they were yellow-polka-dotted, or purplish-orange 8-). Likewise, I don't think anybody has a picture of Jesus (is there ? 8-) ) So our current image of Jesus is our best guess. 
soc.religion.christian	 I am myself an SDA and I am in total agreement with what Darius has to say. I also worship on Saturday to honor the Lord. Your mention of "[esteeming] all days alike" IMO has to do with the fast days observed by the Jews. But no matter how you interpret that passage, I do accept your worship on Sunday as being done in honor of the Lord, in contrast with what many of my fellow SDA believers may believe. To me, though, the bible overwhelmingly points to Saturday as the day to be kept in honor of creation and of God's deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage. To those who would attempt to point out that my observance of Saturday is being legalistic, this is simply not the case. Rather, keeping Saturday allows me a full day to rest and contemplate God's goodness and grace. 
soc.religion.christian	 The way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically* married, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse. 
soc.religion.christian	 Yes, I agree. What I'm trying to point out is that, in matters of faith (i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convinced of the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal revelation. And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those beliefs with others. And I don't think that its arrogant, persay, to accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself. Where I think the conflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefs arise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God must reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would honestly agree. I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are rejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient for them, or because they wish to spurn God. 
soc.religion.christian	 There is another way to view this. The True Celebration is Easter, the Resurrection of Our Lord. This has been true from the foundation of the world. Pagan practices are then either: 
soc.religion.christian	 I would be a bit more specific in looking at this verse in regard to 'blocking' prayer. I have trouble thinking that God would allow anything to block our access to him in prayer, especially if we have sinned and are praying for forgivenenss. I can see, however, how our prayer life might be hindered by our sin, if we are concentrating on what is causing the sin or what has happened, we may not be thinking about prayer, thus our prayers are 'hindered' by our own actions. But I don't think anything can 'block' the transmission, or reception of prayer to God. Shalom, Len Howard 
soc.religion.christian	 Whether there is a "why" or not we have to find it. This is Pascal's(?) wager. If there is no why and we spend our lives searching, then we have merely wasted our lives, which were meaningless anyway. If there is a why and we don't search for it, then we have wasted our potentially meaningful lives. Suppose the universe is 5 billion years old, and suppose it lasts another 5 billion years. Suppose I live to be 100. That is nothing, that is so small that it is scary. So by searching for the "why" along with my friends here on earth if nothing else we aren't so scared. 
soc.religion.christian	 If I don't think my belief is right and everyone else's belief is wrong, then I don't have a belief. This is simply what belief means. Where does the authority for a belief come from? Nowhere, for a belief is itself authoratative. If I produce authority for a belief, where will I find authority for my belief in the legitimacy of the authority. In short, the mind has to start somewhere. (By the way, the majority of Christians, i.e. Catholics, believe in the authority of the Church, and derive the authority of the Bible from its acceptance by the Church.) 
soc.religion.christian	 A section of Richard Badenas' book, "Christ The End of the Law, Romans 10.14 in Pauline Perspective." The section I have is on the Contextual setting and meaning of Romans 9-11. In addition, there are 111 endnotes. 
soc.religion.christian	 But what if the geologists are wrong and these people are warning of a non-existent danger? Analogies can only push an argument so far (on both sides). Both Melinda's and yours assume the premises used to set up your respective analogies are true and thus the correct conclusion will arise. 
soc.religion.christian	 I have been told that I seem to be very smug in my post. I appoligize if anyone felt this way. I did not at all desire to come across in that way. I was trying to express that I didn't understand his logic and that I wished him the best in his life. 
soc.religion.christian	 I agree we need sleep & etc, but I disagree we are _just_ animals. That statement is a categorical negative; it's like saying there are _no_ polkadoted elephants. It may be true but one would have to be omniscient to know for sure. 
soc.religion.christian	 Yep. There's truth in all those religions, even in science. Christianity doesn't claim to know it all. It does claim certain things are true though that contradict other religions' truth claims. So they can't all be true. 
soc.religion.christian	 I think it was Lewis who said that in a wedding, it's the principals that marry each other; the church and the state are present merely as witnesses. 
soc.religion.christian	 I won't even recommend books from my congregation. What you ask sounds attractive but it is dangerous. As a new Christian you don't want to be contaminated with other people's interpretation. Steep your self in scripture, and discuss with other christians. Read if your must but remember that what other people write is their interpretation. God has promised to give you light, so ask for it. 
soc.religion.christian	 LISTOWNER: I have sent this to Mr Anderson privately. Post it only if you think it of general interest. 
soc.religion.christian	 I'm interested if anyone out here can point me towards a review of the following book in any scholarly Christian journal, whether it be conservative or liberal, Protestant or Catholic. 
soc.religion.christian	 Frank, I got your mailing on early historical references to Christianity. I'd like to respond, but I lost your address. Please mail me. 
soc.religion.christian	 A "new Christian" wrote that he was new to the faith and learning about it "by reading the Bible, of course". I am not at all sure this is the best path to follow. While the Bible is, for Christians, the word of God, the revelation of God is Jesus Christ and the chief legacy of this revalation is the Church. I am not recommending any one denommination, but I do recommend finding a comfortable christian congregation in which to develop your faith, rather than just reading the Bible. This does not mean that the Bible should not be read, although I would stick to the Gospels, epistles, and Psalms and avoid the Book of Revelation altogether [until you are with friends you are comfortable with]. I am sure that mistakenly fervent projects to read the entire Bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkable lack of fervour somewhere in the middle of Leviticus, or for the really sturdy, somewhere in Chronicles. The point is that the Bible is their to illustrate the Faith of Christians, but does not provide the totality of that faith. Vital beliefs of virtually all Christians are simply not mentioned - the Trinity, the duality of natures in Christ, types of Church organization. All these beliefs and practices have developed from the lived experience of the Christian people, an experience lived one hopes in the Spirit. As such the Bible, I think, is better studies in the context of a congregation, and the context of other reading. Following up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine, I would even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on the christian life. [Most novels of any profundity are actually discussing the nature of good and evil in the human heart]. My own induction into the christian faith was brought about [after grace] through reading Graham Greene: _The Power and the Glory_ and the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins. I would also recommend Graham Greene's _Monsignor Quixote_ and any novel by Iris Murdoch. The last is not even a Christian, but such is her insistence on the need for the good life, that, frankly, I often am more uplifted and God directed after reading her than after reading many parts of the Bible. And that after all is what being a Christian is all about: letting your soul and your life be, in some way, directed towards the infinite, represented to us by the person of Jesus Christ. 
soc.religion.christian	 I don't know which passage you are refering to, but the passage I have often seen cited as an example of a mother image of God is Isaiah 49:15 "Can a woman forget her sucking child / that she should have no compassion / on the son of her womb? / Even these may forget, / yet I will not forget you." 
soc.religion.christian	 without active participation. If you know the Latin, one really beautiful way to hear the Passion is it's being chanted by three deacons: the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants in the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor. 
soc.religion.christian	 I don't know why it is so obvious. We are not speaking of acts of the flesh. We are just speaking of emotions. Emotions are not of themselves moral or immoral, good or bad. Emotions just are. The first step is not to label his emotion as good or bad or to numb ourselves so that we hide our true feelings, it is to accept ourselves as we are, as God accepts us. It seems that Paul's anger he has accepted and channeled it to a plea to all of us to refrain from passing judgement on those afflicted with a disease and to reach out to others. Give in? Calling his arguments foolish, belittling them to only quarrels, avoiding action because of fear to give others a bad feeling, he's not forgiving? 
soc.religion.christian	 J.N. Darby was one of the founders of the "Plymouth Brethren" and an early supporter of dispensationalism. F.F. Bruce highly approved of his translation. He also translated the Bible into several other languages. 
soc.religion.christian	 Actually the book is called "Seventh Day Adventists believe..." And there are 27 basica beliefs. I believe it is printed by the Reveiew and Herald Publishing Association. 
soc.religion.christian	 If I am not mistaken, the Jewish family names Cohen, Kahn, etc. are considered to be legitimate indicators of descent from Aaron. The family names Levi, Levene, etc. are considered to be legitimate indicators of descent from Levi. The main legal issue is the purification of the priesthood, which is supposed to involve finding the ashes of of the red heifer last used for this purpose 2000 years ago. _______________________________________________________________________________ 
soc.religion.christian	 Typical statement from an irrational and brainwashed person. The bible was written by some male chavnist thousands of years ago (as were all of the "holy" books). Follow the parts that you think are suitable for modern life. Ignore the others. For heaven's (!) sake don't take it literally. 
soc.religion.christian	 This is being posted as a general outline for your personal study of this doctrine: 
soc.religion.christian	 John 1:1 says (NKJV - the little green gideon someone forced on me one day) "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." The Word refers to Jesus Christ so from this John declares that God and Jesus are one. Therefore, "The Lord" refers to both. Also, David in the Psalms refers to both God in heaven and the coming messiah as his Lord. Once again this refers to God and Jesus. 
soc.religion.christian	 I must have missed the postings about Waco, David Koresh, and the Second Coming. How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing, unless the person claiming to be IT is obviously insane? 
soc.religion.christian	 Pardon me if this is the wrong newsgroup. I would describe myself as an agnostic, in so far as I'm sure there is no single, universal supreme being, but if there is one and it is just, we will surely be judged on whether we lived good lives, striving to achieve that goodness that is within the power of each of us. Now, the complication is that one of my best friends has become very fundamentalist. That would normally be a non-issue with me, but he feels it is his responsibility to proselytize me (which I guess it is, according to his faith). This is a great strain to our friendship. I would have no problem if the subject didn't come up, but when it does, the discussion quickly begins to offend both of us: he is offended because I call into question his bedrock beliefs; I am offended by what I feel is a subscription to superstition, rationalized by such circular arguments as 'the Bible is God's word because He tells us in the Bible that it is so.' So my question is, how can I convince him that this is a subject better left undiscussed, so we can preserve what is (in all areas other than religious beliefs) a great friendship? How do I convince him that I am 'beyond saving' so he won't try? Thanks for any advice. 
soc.religion.christian	 I'm concerned about a recent posting about WBT/SIL. I thought they'd pretty much been denounced as a right-wing organization involved in ideological manipulation and cultural interference, including Vietnam and South America. A commission from Mexican Academia denounced them in 1979 as " a covert political and ideological institution used by the U.S. govt as an instrument of control, regulation, penetration, espionage and repression." My concern is that this group may be seen as acceptable and even Christians don't immediately accept every "Christian" organization as automatically above reproach. 
soc.religion.christian	 I'm compiling a bibliography on religious perspectives on esotericism, hermeticism, gnosticism, mysticism, occultism, alchemy and magic, and am interested in sources that others have found particularly interesting and insightful. I'm especially interested in medieval works, such as _The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz_ and Arthurian legends. 
soc.religion.christian	 Christians is that some Christians profess absolute certianty about their beliefs and doctrines. That is, many Christians insist that they CANNOT have made any mistakes when discovering their beliefs, which amounts to saying that they are infallible. 
soc.religion.christian	 All of the arguments concerning the Sabbath ought to make the point pretty clear - anyone outside of the Catholic or Orthodox orAnglican or Monophysite churches ourght to worship on Saturday if they are really sola scriptura. Otherwise, they are following a law put into effect by the Church, and only the above Chruches really recognize any power of the Chruch to do so. 
soc.religion.christian	 I appreciated the follow-ups and replies to my earlier query. One reply, which I have lost, suggested several parishes in New York that have good Masses, one of which was Corpus Christi in downtown Manhattan. By coincidence, last week's _America_, the national Jesuit magazine, carried an interview with Fr. Myles Bourke, Corpus Christi's pastor emeritus. Fr. Bourke also directed the NT translation in the New American Bible. He noted "...certain practices have been introduced into the Mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality, and sometimes of hilarity, has trivialized the liturgy." I note that at my parents' parish on Easter, helium filled balloons were distributed at the offertory, apparently to aid in understanding the word "risen". This was not a kiddie mass, either, but the well-attended 11:00 Mass. 
soc.religion.christian	 Why do you assume that Jesus's plea to His Father "to let this cup pass from Him", was merely a plea to escape death? When I look at Jesus in the garden, I see a Man-God, who all His life had had the presense of His Father with Him. As a result, He knew every detail about His death long before the Agony in the Garden. But as that hour approached, He felt abandoned by His Father, His presense diminishing with each passing minute. In addition, it was brought more and more to Jesus's attention (the betrayal of Judas was probably a big impact) that His suffering would be to no avail for many people, especially those who would reject Him, not only then but in the future. I truly believe that the majority of Jesus's suffering was mental and spiritual, while the physical portion was only the tip of the iceburg. 
soc.religion.christian	 Jeff Fenholt claims to have once been a roadie for Black Sabbath. He was never ever a musician in the band. He was in St. Louis several months back. The poster I saw at the Christian bookstore I frequent really turned me off. It was addressed to all "Homosexuals, prostitutes, drug addicts, alcoholics, and headbangers..." or something like that. 
soc.religion.christian	 My news feed is broken and I haven't received any new news in 243 hours (more than 10 days). So, if you reply to this, please send private email to the address esther@demand.ed.ray.com -- I have set the Reply-To line to have that address but I don't know if it will work. 
soc.religion.christian	 You ask where we are. I would echo that question. I'm not trying to be contentious. But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions? What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time? This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically stood by the Pope. 
soc.religion.christian	 I disagree. People marry each other. When they commit fully to each other as life partners, they are married. The ceremony may assist in emphasizing the depth of such a commitment, but is of itself nothing. God knows our hearts. He knows when two have committed themselves to be one, he knows the fears and delusions we have that keep us from fully giving ourselves to another. The way I see it, you'd have to be living together in a marriage for somewhere between 10 and 100 years before anyone knew if a marriage really existed, but God knows. I don't think God keeps a scorebook. 
soc.religion.christian	 Darren In an earlier article, I explained that what many people find Darren arrogant about Christians is that some Christians profess Darren absolute certainty about their beliefs and doctrines. 
soc.religion.christian	 For the Lord Himself will descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord. 
soc.religion.christian	 I believe this is a just another of way of expressing the basic truth "All things were created by him and FOR him." (emphasis mine) Col. 1:16 , Rev. 4:11. If you and I have been created for God, naturally there will be a vacuum if God is not our all and all. In fact, the first chapter of Collosians brings out this status of Christ, that He should have the preeminence. When you life is alligned with Him, and you do His will, then the vacuum is filled. 
soc.religion.christian	 There was a recent discussion of Dungeons and Dragons and other role playing games. Since there is a lot of crossover between gamers and science fiction and fantasy fans, I will mention that I am the editor and publisher of RADIO FREE THULCANRA, a Christian-oriented science fiction fanzine. It is not a Christian magazine with a special interest in science fiction. It is a science fiction fanzine with a special interest in Christianity. Gaming is not a major topic of discussion but it has come up in some letters. (No, there are no arguments about whether D&D is satanic. People who think it is are not likely to be reading RFT.) Anyway, I am now working on the April issue. I will send a sample copy to any reader of requests should include a snail-mail address. 
soc.religion.christian	 Jesus isn't God ? When Jesus returns some people may miss Him ? What version of the Bible do you read Mike ? 
soc.religion.christian	 An interesting interpretation of Revelation 17 and 18 has been given by evangelist David Wilkerson. I am not saying that I totally agree with his interpretation, but it is certainly believable and good food for thought. He interprets the Babylon of Revelation 17-18 as being none other than the good old U. S. of A. That's right, America. He supports his claim in several ways. The Babylon of Revelation is THE world leader in trade and commerce, and the WHOLE WORLD wept when Babylon fell. The American dollar, despite the Japanese success of the 20th century, is STILL the most sought after currency in the world. If the U.S. were destroyed, wouldn't the whole world mourn? The bible also talks about Babylon being a home of harlots, sin, and adultery (I am paraphrasing, of course). Babylon's sin affected, or should I say, infected, the whole world. It doesn't take much looking to see that the U.S. is in a state of moral decay. Hasn't the American culture and Hollywood spread the "do it if it feels good" mentality all over the world. I think, though, that what Mr. Wilkerson uses as his strongest argument is the fact that Revelation calls Babylon "Babylon the Great" and portrays it as the most powerful nation on earth. No matter how dissatisfied you are with the state of our country, I don't think you would have too much trouble agreeing that the U.S. is STILL the most powerful nation on earth. 
soc.religion.christian	 Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm afraid your friendship is in danger. Perhaps you should examine in yourself why as such a good friend, you are unwilling to accept this imortant part of your friends life? Why do you call into question his faith? Your friend has changed, he has found something that fills a need in his life. You need to decide if you are still his friend, whether you can accommodate his new life. It sounds as if you are criticizing him for a fundamental belief in the Bible, yet you are quick to reveal that your fundamental belief that it is superstition. Perhaps if he knew you at least took him seriously, that you at least took an interest in the light he has found, that you at least tried to understand what has become a special part of his life, you could together decide to become fundamentalists, respect each others differences and remain friends, or part ways. Maybe even if you stuck it out with him, you could help him to un-convert. Of course, if you go in with that attitude he will surely see through your intentions and begin to resent you. 
soc.religion.christian	 Heres a story of a Saint that people might like to read. I got it from a The Morning Star, and am posting it with the permission of the editor. 
soc.religion.christian	 I have discussed this with my girlfriend often. I consider myself married, though legally I am not. Neither of us have been with other people sexually, although we have been with each other. We did not have sexual relations until we decided to marry eventually. For financial and distance reasons, we will not be legally married for another year and a half. Until then, I consider myself married for life in God's eyes. I have faith that we have a strong relationship, and have had for over 4 years, and will be full of joy when we marry in a church. First, however, we must find a church( we will be living in a new area when we marry, and will need to find a new church community). 
soc.religion.christian	 There is some controversy in my denomination as to what authority is vested in the pastor. I am still forming my opinion. I am solicing opinions, and references for what that is, how much, and how it should be used. 
soc.religion.christian	 I have stated before that I do not consider myself an atheist, but definitely do not believe in the christian god. The recent discussion about atheists and hell, combined with a post to another group (to the effect of 'you will all go to hell') has me interested in the consensus as to how a god might judge men. As a catholic, I was told that a jew, buddhist, etc. might go to heaven, but obviously some people do not believe this. Even more see atheists and pagans (I assume I would be lumped into this category) to be hellbound. I know you believe only god can judge, and I do not ask you to, just for your opinions. 
soc.religion.christian	 As far as I can see, one of the big differences between Davidians and Christians is in who they follow. I have sometimes tried to put myself in the feet of one of Jesus's disciples. Basically, they gave up a lot --- career, possibly family, and well, a whole bunch, to follow Jesus. 
soc.religion.christian	 Praise God! I'm writing everyone to inform you that I have been accepted to the Doctor of Psychology program at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, CA. I've been working long and hard to try to get in there and have said many hours of prayer. I'm very excited for this opportunity, but also very nervous about it. 
soc.religion.christian	 A Rabbi once told me that theres is a talmudic tradition that someone who wanted to convert to Judaism was to be turned away three times. If they continue then they were accepted. 
soc.religion.christian	 I'd like to remind people of the withering of the fig tree and Jesus driving the money changers et. al. out of the temple. I think those were two instances of Christ showing anger (as part of His human side). 
soc.religion.christian	 I'd suggest that more than _some_ qualms are in order. Without knowing anything about the situation, it is impossible to evaluate the appropriateness of writing. Some folks will check, others with more zeal than time may not. 
soc.religion.christian	 Cloak yourself in God's sustaining and abiding love. Pray, pray, pray. Pray for your brother, that he will assume the Godly role that is his. Pray for your sister-in-law, the what ever is driving her to separate your brother and herself from the the rest of the family will be healed. Pray for God to give you the peace in the knowledge that you may not be able to 'fix' it. From your description it would appear that it will require devine intervention, and the realization by your brother as to what his responsibilities are. Seek Godly counsel from your pastor, or other spiritually mature believer. Know always that He is akways there as a conforter, and will give you wisdon and direction as you call on Him. 
soc.religion.christian	 If you agree that good works have a role somewhere, you will generally find yourself in one of two camps: 
soc.religion.christian	 Unfortunatly, this seems to be how Christians are taught to think when it comes to their religion. Some take it to the extreme and say that their religion is the ONLY one and if you don't accept their teachings then you won't be "saved". It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim to know what God thinks/wants. Especially when it's based upon your interpretation of a book. The logic in the above statement is faulty in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can't both be correct. It's all about perception. No two people are exactly alike. No two people perceive everything in the same way. I believe that there is one truth. Call it God's truth, a universal truth, or call it what you will. I don't believe God presents this truth. I think it is just there and it's up to you to look for and see it, through prayer, meditation, inspir- ation, dreams or whatever. Just because people may perceive this truth differently, it doesn't mean one is wrong and the other is right. As an example, take the question, "Is the glass half empty or half full"? You can have two different answers which are contradictory and yet both are correct. So, for your belief to be true, does not require everyone else's belief to be wrong. 
soc.religion.christian	 It is funny how this one little quote from Genesis is treated by certain anti-Christians as if Christians have been given a firm command to destroy the earth. You could prove almost anything by taking little quotes out of context from the Bible - it's a big book, you know. I doubt you could find a single case of a anti-ecological action taking place specifically because teh perpetrator was motivated by a Christian belief. 
soc.religion.christian	 If the Papacy is infallible, and this is a matter of faith, then the Pope cannot "be wrong!" If, on the other hand, this is not a matter of faith, but a matter of Church law, then we should still obey as the Pope is the legal head of the church. 
soc.religion.christian	 Let me carry that a step further. Most doctors would not claim to be infallible. Indeed, they would generally admit that they could conceivably be wrong, e.g. that in this case, a blood tranfusion might not turn out to be necessary after all. However, the doctors would have enough confidence and conviction to claim, out of genuine concern, that is IS necessary. As fallible human beings, they must acknowledge the possibility that they are wrong. However, they would also say that such doubts are not reasonable, and stand by their convictions. 
soc.religion.christian	 my $.02 - Yes and No. I do not believe the above scenario is not possible. Either they are believing and living (in at least some part) led by God, else they are not. Believing (intellectually, but waiting(?)) is not enough. Especially important to remember is that no one can judge whether you are so committed, nor can you judge someone else. I guess the closest we can come to know someone's situation is listening to their own statements. This can be fallible, as is our sense of communion one with another. 
soc.religion.christian	 small group of no more than 15 believers. The small groups are responsible for the ministry of the church: evangelism and discipleship. The emphasis is on relationships, not on programs, and both the evangelism and the discipling are relationship-based. 
soc.religion.christian	 Very interesting, but I also believe that you have presented a misleading argument. Christianity is not the cause of the massacres and horrific injustices that you relate, rather they are the fault of people who misunderstand Jesus Christ's message, and modify it to suit their own beliefs and aims, rather than alter their ambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable in the New Testament. With every truthful and good message that carries authority or implied authority, comes the inevitable fact that some (many?) people will understand it in a distorted way, with inevitable consequences. 
soc.religion.christian	 There was an article on clari.news.religion in the last few days about a Polish tribunal decision. It said that crucifixes and religious classes in public schools were okay; and that children who did not want to take religion class could not be forced to take an ethics class as a substitute. 
soc.religion.christian	 Even if there was no independent proof that Luke's account was valid, I find it strange that you would take the negation of it as truth without any direct historical evidence (at least that you've mentioned) to back it up. The assertion was made, unequivocally that no Christian ever sufferred for their faith by believing in the Resurrection. Luke's account suggests otherwise, and in the absence of direct eyewitnesses who can claim that Luke is mistaken, then I suggest that this unequivocal assertion is suspect. 
soc.religion.christian	 I have been following this thread on talk.religion, the different non-biblical argument those who oppose the Sabbath present. 
soc.religion.christian	 First, off I'd say that the impact if right before your eyes! 8-) That we are even discussing this is a major impact in and of itself. Further, the early church bears testimony to the impact. 
soc.religion.christian	 But then, on the other hand, if you really loved that King more than you did yourself, and He loved you to the point of assuring you that the eternal time spent with him would be eternal ecstasy, would you really opt for that choice? 
soc.religion.christian	 I think you are vastly oversimplifying things. We know that early Christians suffered totures because of their witness to Christ. For example: 
soc.religion.christian	 I am asking you to believe in things not visible. I don't know if this is believeing blindly or not. I'm not sure how blindness comes into it. I do not deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions from evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on the evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the rather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere is not self explanatory). 
soc.religion.christian	 My impression is that *for advanced work* you will be much better off with German reference works (lexicons, concordances especially). For a first-time encounter, my *personal* preference would be to deal with a textbook written in my native language. But if you know German and are in Germany, pick up all the reference books you think you can handle. (I only know these works by reputation, since my German is most rusty, but I'd look at the following books: Koehler's lexicon, Mandeldern's concordance, the Jenni & Westermann theological dictionary of the OT.) 
soc.religion.christian	 I originally wrote to the person who asked this question personally, but decided to post the information I had on the topic.

soc.religion.christian	 My family has never been particularly religious - singing Christmas carols is about the limit for them. Thus I've never really believed in God and heaven, although I don't actually believe that they don't exist either - I'm sort of undecided, probably like a lot of people I guess. Lately I've been thinking about it all a lot more, and I wondered how religious people can be so convinced that there is a God. I feel as though I want to believe, but I'm not used to believing things without proof - just as I can't believe that there definitely isn't a God, so I can't definitely believe that there is. I wondered if most of you were brought up by religious families and never believed any different. Can anyone help me to understand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong. 
soc.religion.christian	 I would go further: if a couple are unwilling to have their commitment publicly witnessed and recorded, that's prima facie evidence that the commitment isn't really there. 
soc.religion.christian	 Where in the Bible is there *any* teaching about an immaterial afterlife? I was always taught that both the O.T. Jews and the N.T. Christians would have found the notion incomprehensible--as do I. 
soc.religion.christian	 I find this view of Christianity to be quite disheartening and sad. The idea that life only has meaning or importance if there is a Creator does not seem like much of a basis for belief. 
soc.religion.christian	 Hi I am a Sociology student and I am currently researching into young offenders. I am looking at the way various groups of children are raised at home. At the moment I am formlulating information on discipline within the Christian home. 
soc.religion.christian	 Please, leave heaven out of it. For his own sake, I pray that Dan does take it literally because that's how God intended it to be taken. Dan, your view of many groups appears correct from my point of view. However, I have found a group which is truly meeting requirements laid down by the Bible on what it means to be a disciple of Jesus. I have no clue where wwc is, but please mail me. I'd really like to get you in touch with them.

soc.religion.christian	 I am told that Planned Parenthood/SIECUS-style "values-free" methods, that teach contraceptive technology and advise kids how to make "choices", actually _increase_ pregnancy rates. I posted a long article on this a while back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested. The article included sources to contact for information on research verifying these statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiring abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use. 
soc.religion.christian	 involves acknowleding a "higher power". AA and other 12-step abuse- recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective. 
soc.religion.christian	 So long as we think that good things are what we *have* to do rather than what we come to *want* to do, we miss the point. The more we love God; the more we come to love what and whom He loves. 
soc.religion.christian	 Hi there netters, I have a question I would very much like to see some discussion on: Is there such a thing as a 'justifible' war? 
soc.religion.christian	 I used to be a marriage commissioner for the Alaska Court System (sort of a justice of the peace). I had great difficulty with that duty. I used to pray earnestly in the courthouse bathroom before the ceremonies, mostly asking that the couples would come to appreciate and fulfill the true holiness and divine purpose in marriage--couples who obviously didn't realize that marriage is God's institution, not the state's. Gradually, however, I came to conclude that because I was acting in a strictly secular, public capacity, established as such by both the state and the expectations of the couples involved, I was really conducting a purely secular, legal civil event, with no greater moral or religious implications than if I had been conducting a civil trial (the couple who told me, mid-ceremony, to "please hurry it up" may have helped me to this conclusion). 
soc.religion.christian	 Romans 8:28 (RSV) We know that in everything God works for good with those who love him, who are called according to his purpose. 
soc.religion.christian	 I've been thinking about the idea that was raised (by Michael Covington, I think) that words mean what we think they mean, regardless of etymology. I've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes. 
soc.religion.christian	 just because one says christianity -- true christianity -- is hard to follow faithfully does NOT mean that one discounts the validity and difficulty of other religions. i admire those of any religion who are willing to make the kind of sacrifices and dedicate themselves spiritually in the way you are talking about. 
soc.religion.christian	 perhaps you can tell your friend that you feel pressured by his continual discussions of this topic -- surely he doesn't feel you should be _pressured_ into something you feel uncomfortable about (since christianity should be a choice one should make on one's own). please also realize that he is doing this out of friendship -- he probably feels you are missing out on something great, and wants to tell you about it. but since you know where you can learn about christianity, you can tell him that it is now up to you to make that choice, and if the choice is no, you should be respected for that. personally i believe that a christian's mission is just to be christ-like, showing his/her own faith and happiness in that faith, and make sure people know they are welcome to talk to you about it. i do not believe in imposing your beliefs upon others -- but then again everyone's definitions of "imposing" may differ. 
soc.religion.christian	 Here is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism in general and Archishop Lefebvre in particular. He wrote it around 1990. The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous activities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all that. And I pared down the rest to what was relevant. 
soc.religion.christian	 I would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime; causes precede their effects. But if you claim that there must be an answer to "how" did the universe (our spacetime) emerge from "nothing", science has some good candidates for an answer. 
soc.religion.christian	 impact on the power of God. In the past, God gave us the ability to create life through sexual relations. Now, he is giving us the ability to create life through in vitro fertilization. The difference between the two is merely cosmetic, and even if we gain the ability to create universes we won't begin to approach the glory of God. The power we are being given is a test, and I am sure that in many cases we will use our new abilities unwisely. But, people have been using sexuality unwisely for millenia and I haven't heard an outcry to abolish it yet! No matter how far we extend our dominion over the physical world, we aren't impinging on God's power. It's only when we attempt to gain control of the spiritual world, those things that can't be approached through science and logic, that we begin to interfere with God. 
soc.religion.christian	 You haven't fully explained the atheist position. Many theists believe that there is "no proof of the existence of God" but choose to believe in him anyway. I haven't yet found an argument for atheism that can't quickly be broken down to unprovable assumptions. This isn't a problem with me (everybody needs to have a faith) but if you believe that you can provide a "purely logical" argument for the nonexistence of God, I'd really like to see it. 
soc.religion.christian	 This is a good point. Christ was hardly the only person who claimed to be the Messiah--in fact, a number of "Messiahs" were active in the area from the time of the Roman conquest to after the fall of Masada. Many of the statements made by the apostles--especially their repeated attempts to give Jesus a sword (give him military power) point to the fact that they didn't realize the true nature of his reign until after the fact. Many of the statements in the Bible can be seen as being oriented toward explaining this new definition of "Messiah" to the Jews who were being preached to. 
soc.religion.christian	 You write as if no-one ever became a Christian except people from Christian families. This is not true, as quite a few people on this group can attest (including me).

soc.religion.christian	 The Sophomore (Romans 1:22) 
soc.religion.christian	 I dreamed that the great judgment morning had dawned, and the trumpet had blown. I dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment before the white throne. Oh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate. They cried for the rock and the mountains. They prayed, but their prayers were too late. The soul that had put off salvation, "Not tonight I'll get saved by and by. No time now to think of ....... religion," Alas, he had found time to die. And I saw a Great White Throne. 
soc.religion.christian	 I find it interesting that cls never answered any of the questions posed. Then he goes on the make statements which make me shudder. He has established a two-tiered God. One set of rules for the Jews (his people) and another set for the saved Gentiles (his people). Why would God discriminate? Does the Jew who accepts Jesus now have to live under the Gentile rules. 
soc.religion.christian	 I totally agree with that sentiment. But why do you have to go further and advocate violating what God has set up? That is the question which you have not answered from Scripture. You can worship on every day, as long as you work. But God says the Sabbath is all mine. 
soc.religion.christian	 I have also heard it called an expression of mercy, because Heaven would be far more agonizing for those who had rejected God. 
soc.religion.christian	 Didn't Paul write that if the Resurrection is not true, we are the biggest fools of all? However, whether you believe in Christ or not, His teachings (e.g. love your brotherman as yourself), even if only followed at a secular level, could do a great deal to alleviate some of the problems we see today in the world. Even when I was a rabid atheist I couldn't deny that. 
soc.religion.christian	 Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.

On the negative side however, I suspect that any such simplistic link abstinence-education = decreased pregnancy, contraceptive-education = increased pregnancy is false.

(Please correct me if my guess is wrong.)

Imagine my surprise! I never would have thought it of him.

soc.religion.christian	 Phew! That takes a load off. I don't want to live forever. I wish most Christians held this view. You can't walk across campus in spring without being assailed by fire-and-brimstone preachers. I really think the metaphor should be limited, at least with respect to teaching our children. It's criminal to put these ideas into a young and trusting mind. Besides, why not rely on the positive aspects of your religion to win their faith? 
soc.religion.christian	 I apologize if this article is slightly confusing, and late. The origonal draft didn't make it through the moderators quote-screens. So I did violence to it, but if you remember the article I am responding to it should still make sence. 
soc.religion.christian	 This seems to be a pretty arogant definition of belief. My beliefs are those things which I find to be true based on my experience of the world. This experience includes study of things that I may not have experienced directly. But even then, I can only understand the studies to the extent to which I can relate what I study back to what I have experienced. 
soc.religion.christian	 Well, I think that most Christians believe that your conciousness will somehow continue on after your 'physical' death, which contradicts what most atheists (myself included) believe, namely that your conciousness, being contained in your brain, dies when your brain dies. 
soc.religion.christian	 Most of you will have probably seen the news by the time you read this, but the Branch Davidian compound is no more. This morning about 6:00, the feds punched holes in the compound walls by using a tank. They then started using non-lethal tear gas. Shortly after noon, 2 cult members were seen setting fire to the compound. So far, about 20-30 people have been seen outside the compound. The fate of the other 60 or 70 people is unknown, neither is the fate of the 17 children that were inside. The compound did burn to the ground. 
soc.religion.christian	 This is the problem. This is not hell, this is permanent death. It is indeed what atheists (generally) expect and it is neither fair nor unfair, it just is. You might as well argue about whether being made mostly of carbon and water is "fair". 
soc.religion.christian	 Short reply: We can never achieve perfect health, yet we always strive for it. We don't seek to do God's will because we're forced to, we follow His way because His way is best. The reason it's hard is because we are flawed, not because He's unreasonable. But we seek to follow His way because we want to improve ourselves and our lives. 
soc.religion.christian	 Please realize that I am frequently getting in trouble for straying from orthodoxy, but here is my opinion: 
soc.religion.christian	 General question: Since the world was discovered to be round, the definition of Saturday is, if not ambiguous, at least arbitrary. How would someone answer this? 
soc.religion.christian	 You ask where we are. I would echo that question. I'm not trying to be contentious. But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions? What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time? This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically stood by the Pope. 
soc.religion.christian	 Although I certainly agree with the basic sentiment that snideness is unloving and ineffective, I'm a little disturbed by the formulation that ill temper is not a Christian trait. It seems like a false argument to say that anyone who displays trait X must not be a Christian. Could well be a sinning Christian, but a Christian nonetheless. Anger is human, and Christians are human: Christians get angry and defensive and react badly just like everyone else. It's not perfect righteousness but the effort of seeking righteousness that marks a dedicated Christian. And one of the greatest gifts of faith to me is that of seeking and accepting forgiveness for my failures. Expecting flawless behavior from self or others isn't Christianity: it's perfectionism. 
soc.religion.christian	 I would recommend "Essential Truthes of the Christian Faith" by RC Sproul. It is copywrited 1992 from Tyndale House Publishers. Sproul offers concise explanations, in simple language, of around 100 different Christian doctrines, grouped by subject. I think it would be particularly good for newer Christians (and older Christians suffering spiritual malnutrition), as it gives a Biblically sound basic treatment of the issues, avoiding long in-depth analysis that can wait until after you know the basics.

soc.religion.christian	 First of all, "ceremonial law" is an extraScriptural term. It is sometimes used as a framework to view Scripture. But if you look at Collosions, without going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law, you will see that it does refer to the sabbath.

soc.religion.christian	 I have personally know quite of few of the Wycliffe Bible Translators. As an organization their fundamental purpose is to translate the scriptures into the native languages which in terms usual means learning it and developing a written language (along with teaching the natives to read). It is not associated with the U.S. govt. at all. Many governments want the help of the translators. To the best of my knowledge the Mexican government now encourages them to come. Their idea is not cultural interference but the presentation of the Good News.

soc.religion.christian	 So true. I'm not sure of the basis of the belief, but it was a widely held belief among the laity of the RC church and their support of it lead to it being declared to be true. Basically the teaching on infallibility holds that the pope is infallible in matters of faith and doctrine, the college of bishops is likewise infallible, and the laity is as well. The pope gets most of the attention/criticism but the consensus of the other bodies is equally infallible (according to RC teaching). 
soc.religion.christian	 I have a simple test. I take several people who can speak only one language (e.g. chinese, russian, german, english). Then I let the "gifted one" start "speaking in toungues". The audience should understand the "gifted one" clearly in their native language. However, the "gifted one" can only hear himself speaking in his own language. 
soc.religion.christian	 From time to time I have made reference to a book called "The Two Babylons" which is a book written by Alexander Hislop (mid 1800's) about the Babylonian mystery religion and its flight through history. I was unable to put it down the first time I read it, but others have found it dry. It has numberable references and illustrations. If you are interested in purchasing your own copy, you can call Moody Book Store @ (312)329-4352 and order it for $16.99 and they will ship it to you. It is a good book just to get the reference titles for your own digs into the mystery religions. I have found it invaluable for that purpose alone. But for those who only want to skim the subject, it comes highly recommended. Just a note to my RC brothers and sisters. You may find this to be a diatribe or you may find it to be a test to the origin and true nature of the origin of RCism. If you are offended by anything that asks hard questions about your denomination (as to whether or not it is "Christian") then perhaps you should just passover this offer. To those who are a little more adventurous, go for it and later, please contact me with you reasons pro or con on the scholorship of this book. I really would be interested.

soc.religion.christian	 The proper term for what Mike expresses is Monophysitism. This was a heresy that was condemned in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD. It grew up in reaction to Nestorianism, which held that the Son and Jesus are two different people who happened to be united in the same body temporarily. Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoia and by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox. It believes that Jesus Christ was God (which is correct), that he was man (which is correct), that he was one person (which is correct), but that he had only one nature and one will and oen energy (which is heretical, the orthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two energies, both divine and human, though the wills were in perfect harmony). That is what Mike is trying to get across, that while Jesus came in human form, Mike says He did not have a human nature or a human will. In reality, he had both, though neither made him subject to original sin. It is interesting to note that the Monothelites were a reaction to this conflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures but not two wills or two energies. It also was condemned, at a late council in Constantinople I believe.

soc.religion.christian	 Faris) says: A.Faris <<Posting deleted. The moderator replies: [I think you're talking about the "assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary". It says that "The Immaculate Mother of God, the ever Virgin Mary, having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory." This was defined by a Papal statement in 1950, though it had certainly been believed by some before that. Like the Immaculate Conception, this is primarily a Roman Catholic doctrine, and like it, it has no direct Biblical support. Note that Catholics do not believe in "sola scriptura". That is, they do not believe that the Bible is the only source of Christian knowledge. Thus the fact that a doctrine has little Biblical support is not necessarily significant to them. They believe that truth can be passed on through traditions of the Church, and also that it can be revealed to the Church. I'm not interested in yet another Catholic/Protestant argument, but if any Catholics can tell us the basis for these beliefs, I think it would be appropriate. --clh]

The Bible "ends" with the book of Revelations. But does God's reign end there ? No. So who can say for sure that God's messages are either no longer happening or still happening ? 
soc.religion.christian	 It was a gift from God. I think basically the reasoning was that the tradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus. As the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin was more and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin for life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.) Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with a predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition because she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin. When science discovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that Mary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception. 
soc.religion.christian	 It's my understanding that the U.S. Supreme Court has never given a legal definition of religion. This despite the many cases involving religion that have come before the Court. Can anyone verify or falsify this? Has any state or other government tried to give a legal definition of religion?

soc.religion.christian	 I guess there are at least some people who are not able to support this claim. There are still a lot of languages without the Bible, or a part of the Bible.

soc.religion.christian	 The existence of repeated earth lives and destiny (karma) does not mean that everything that happens is predetermined by past deeds. There is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction, but I did not subscribe to that view.

soc.religion.christian	 Oh yea? Which version of the Bible is the perfectly preserved one? And why are there so many translations that are not perfectly preserved? Is God trying to confuse us? 
soc.religion.christian	 I agree entirely. Speaking as an atheist (heterosexual, for what it's worth), this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties of Christianity. Although I'm sure it's possible to argue theologically that we shouldn't make analogies between discrimination on the basis of sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, morally the case looks unanswerable (for those outside religion): the three forms _are_ analogous; we shouldn't discriminate on the basis of sex, race or sexual orientation. 
soc.religion.christian	 That would be neat, but nowhere in the Bible does it say that one who has the gift of tounges can do this. If the gift of tounges were the ability to be understood by everyone, no matter what languages they know, there would be no need for the gift of interpretation, and I Corinthians 14 would not have had to have been written. 
soc.religion.christian	 Undoubtedly people adopt atheism for many reasons, but I suspect that a biggie is that the God they've believed in is (in J.B. Phillips's words) "too small".

The grey-haired gentleman on a throne who was a comforting image in childhood becomes a joke.

soc.religion.christian	 Mark Ashley's account of private revelation does not, as some might think, contradict my posting in which I said that the Catholic Church believes that public revelation, on which Catholic doctrine is based, ended with the death of St. John, the last Apostle. In that posting I made sure I used the word "public". Public revelation contains God's truth intended for everyone to believe. The revelation contained in the Bible is a significant subset of public revelation. Private revelation is revelation that God gives to an individual. He may speak directly to the individual, He may send an angel, or He may send the Virgin Mary or some lesser saint. The only person who is required to believe a private revelation is the person to whom it is revealed. Devotional practices may be based on reported private revelations, but doctrines can not. 
soc.religion.christian	 Some variant is quite popular. This, and other arguments, are discussed in John Leslie Mackie's "The Miracle of Theism: arguments for and against the existence of God".

soc.religion.christian	 Which is exactly what I pointed out. (Though I was wrong about your use of the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it said the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque. Apparently that has changed.) The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, the Nicene - Constantinopolitan did not. Of course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene Creed (it wasn't there to begin with), but they certainly did from the Athanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning. I might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in ways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the East emphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father through the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and the Son. In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see below)

soc.religion.christian	 Gifts of the Spirit should not be seen as an endorsement of ones behavior. A lot of people have suffered because of similar beliefs. Jesus said that people would come to Him saying "Lord, Lord," and proclaiming the miraculous works they had done in His name. Jesus would tell them that they were workers of iniquity that do not know Him, and to depart from Him. 
soc.religion.christian	 On of the attributes of being sacred in this case is that they should not be spoken of in a "common manner" or "trampled under feet" such as the Lords name is today. The ceremonies are performed in the temple because the temple has been set aside as being as sacred/holy/uncommon place. We believe that the ceremonies can only be interpreted correctly when they are viewed with the right spirit- which in this case is in the temple. So from our point of view, when they are brought out into the public, they are being trampled under feet, because of misinterpretations and mocking, and it is therefore offensive to us. 
soc.religion.christian	 Just a quick question. If Mary was Immaculately concieved, so she could be a pure vessel, does this mean that she was without sin and, therefore, the perfect (meaning sinless) female human being?

soc.religion.christian	 The "so sacred it's secret" explanation is a bit misleading. While there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.

Of coures, having only original sins on thier souls, they suffer the lightest punishment, the loss of the vision oand presence of God, but that does not change the undeniable fact that they cannot possibly come to a forgivenss of original sin, nor can they inherit eternal life. "That," as St. Augustine said, "Is what the Pelagian heretics taught." Which is why he said later, "If you want to be a Christian, do not teach that unbaptized infants can come to a forgivenss of original sin.

Jesus replies that Elijah has come, but they did not recognize him. It then says that the apostles perceived that he was refering to John the Baptist. This seems to me to clearly imply reincarnation. Can anyone offer a reasonable alternative interpretation? I would be very interested to hear it. 
soc.religion.christian	 There seem to be many points to the speaking in tongues thing which are problematic. It's use as prayer language seems especially troubling to me. I understand that when you pray in tongues, the spirit is doing the talking. And when you pray, you pray to God. And the Spirit is God. So, the Spirit is talking to Himself. Which is why I only go by the Pentecost use where it's an actual language. 
soc.religion.christian	 I just thought I'd share a nice experience before my exam today. I was walking down the streets on our campus, and a beggar came up and asked me for any spare change I might have. I had a dollar or so that I gave her, and - not wanting to give away all my money to strangers (I generally give a dollar as that will buy a little food at McDonalds or something) - I offered her some "spiritual gifts," as I called them, rather than gifts of money. I talked of how great I felt that God had made such a pretty day, and how nice it was to give to people - she then said she was getting married soon. She talked about how she and her husband had very little (they may not have even had a house, for all I know), but that they felt a very special love in the Lord, an unselfish kind of caring. It warmed my heart to know that 2 people can have so little monetarily, and realize that spiritually they are indeed very rich. A good lesson for all of us who say we want more, more, more; what we really need cannot be counted, or sold, or bought. 
soc.religion.christian	 I wish to echo what D. Andrew Kille wrote. I know of no published form in English of the D-type recension of "Acts". Of course, Bezae is quite bizarre in the gospels as well. Only D-type texts share Bezae's strange readings. [By the way, "D" stands for Codex Claromontanus elsewhere.] Frank D 
soc.religion.christian	 Satan was one of God's highest ranking angels, like Uriel, Raphael, Michael, and Gabriel. In fact, his name was Satanel. He did challenge God's authority and got kicked out of heaven. A lot of the mythology of Satan (he lost the -el suffix when he fell) comes from the Book of Enoch and is not found in the bible. 
soc.religion.christian	 i agree -- if you are going to find out anything from people who don't share your beliefs, do not attack them or condescend to them and hope to get a neutral picture of them. come to them with an open mind. 
soc.religion.christian	 i did a workshop on this for an episcopalian student gathering a couple months ago because i wanted to know the answer too. as far as i could tell, although that story was never specifically _told_ in the bible, many references are made to it, primarily in the new testament. in the old testament there is actually an entirely different view of satan as a (excuse the pun) "devil's advocate" for yahweh. see the book of job. getting back to the fallen angel story, there are _no_ references to "lucifer" in the bible except for a mistranslation of "the morning star" in the king james version (isaiah 14:12), which probably referred to a babylonian monarch much in the same was as "the sun king" referred to louis xiv. 
soc.religion.christian	 I differ with our moderator on this. I thought the whole idea of God coming down to earth to live as one of us "subject to sin and death" (as one of the consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) puts it) was that Jesus was tempted, but did not succumb. If sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity, then Jesus "fully human" (Nicea) would not be "subject to sin", but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning, because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin. To distinguish between "human" and "fallen human" makes Jesus less like one of us at the time we need him most. 
soc.religion.christian	 Which Version of the Bible do you consider to be the most accurate translation? 
soc.religion.christian	 Somewhere, someone told me that Satan was the angel in charge of music in heaven, and on top of that, he was the most beautiful of the angels. Isn't it funny that these days how MTV has become the "bible" of music and beauty these days. MTV controls what bands are popular, no matter how bad they are. In fact, it is better to be politically correct - like U2, Madonna - than to have any musical talent. Then of course, you have this television station that tells us all how to dress. Think about it, who started the retro-fashion craze?? MTV and Madonna. Gag. 
soc.religion.christian	 I was waiting for this. I think your question should be rephrased. The many verses of the Bible which condem homosexuality (by our beliefs) have been shoved down the throats of homosexuals for a long time by (well-meaning?) Christians. The question is how do they interpret these verses. Any discussion of any issue (this or any other issue) requires a proof of your case as well as a disproof of the opposing view. We are already familiar with those verses and many have proven to themselves that these condem homosexual behaviour. We must now establish reasons for not believing this to be true based on the interpretation of these scriptures given by someone who has come to grips with them.

In particular I'm interested to know if any stigma is attached to the children as opposed to the parents. I'm especially keen to learn if there is or is not any prohibition in the Mormon faith on bastards entering heaven or having their names entered in the big genealogical book the Mormons keep in Salt Lake City. If this is an issue on which the "official" position has changed over time, I'm interested in learning both old and new beliefs. E-mail or posting is fine. All information or pointers are appreciated. 
soc.religion.christian	 Strictly speaking, you're right - we can't repent _for_ somebody else, for what they've done. I guess I don't think it's out of line to talk about a generalized repentence for our contribution to or participation in "The sins of society" , or for our tacit approval (by our silence) of sinful attitudes or practices....it may be that we're also just plain begging for mercy, hoping God will withhold his hand of judgement on our whole country for the sake of a few, much as Abraham sought to do for the sake of Lot. (Hmmm, the results there were pretty cautionary...)

soc.religion.christian	 A listmember (D Andrew Killie, I think) wrote, in response to the suggestion that genocide may sometimes be the will of God: 
soc.religion.christian	 Hi Damon, No matter what system or explanation of creation you wish to accept, you always have to start with one of two premises, creation from nothing, or creation from something. There are no other alternatives. And if we accept one or the other of those two premises, then again there are two alternatives, either creation was random, or was according to some plan. If it was random, I am unable to accept that the complex nature of our world with interrelated interdependent organisms and creatures could exist as they do. Therefore I am left with creation under the control of an intelligence capable of devising such a scheme. I call that intelligence God. I also prefer the "Creatio ex nihilo" rather than from chaos, as it is cleaner. There is obviously no way to prove either or neither. We are and we must have come from somewhere. Choose whatever explanation you feel most comfortable with, Damon. You are the one who has to live with your choice. Shalom, Len Howard 
soc.religion.christian	 Woah...The context is about God's calling out a special people (the Jews) to carry the "promise." To read the meaning as literal people is to miss Paul's entire point. I'd be glad to send anyone more detailed explanations of this passage if interested. 
soc.religion.christian	 Good point. The New Testament does not quote Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Ruth, Job, Ecclesiastes, or Song of Songs, just as it does not quote from the Deuterocanon. But if the non-quotation of the former does not disqualify them, neither does the non-quotation of the later. And the Wisodm of Solomon was quite clearly an influence on St. Paul, especially in the letter to the Romans (cf especially Romans 1.18-32 and Wisdom 13-14). 
soc.religion.christian	 May I suggest the book: "Ethics" by Dr. Norm Geisler, of Dallas Theological Seminary. In it, he goes over all the arguments pro and con and in-between, and comes up with a very reasonable answer. If I have time, and there is enough interest, I may post his position. 
soc.religion.christian	 jubilee, Pope Leo the 12th had a medallion cast with his own image on one side and on the other side, the Church of Rome symbolized as a "Woman, holding in her left hand a cross, and in her right a cup with legend around her, 'Sedet super universum', 'The whole world is her seat." 
soc.religion.christian	 Note that I said the fall of Rome, not of the Empire. The Roman Empire lasted until 1453, with its transfered capital in Constantinople. The main reason for it's fall was not so much the sack of Constantinople by the men of the 4th Crusade (who were not Christians - they had been excommunicated down to the last man after attacking the Christian city of Zara in Croatia), but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of Mazinkert. After the Turks breached the frontier, it was only a matter of time before the Empire fell, the inability of the Empire to hold onto the rim of Anatolia, with the Ottomans and Rum Seljuks in the middle should be quite obvious to any student of history. The sack of Constantinople only hastened the inevitable along. For if the Greeks had wanted to save their empire, why would they not cooperate with the Crusaders when they came to do battle with the Saracens in the 1st-3rd Crusades? Because of their obstinacy over cooperating with people they considered heretics, even though those "heretics" were fighting for the cause of the Empire and Christendom in doing battle with the Turkish hordes in Anatolia, Edessa, Lebanon, Palastine, and Syria, the some hordes who were to later sack Constantinople, and overrun a third of Europe (the Balkans, Hungary, the Ukraine, the Caucasus, etc.)

soc.religion.christian	 was condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in Monophysitism. 
soc.religion.christian	 Of course I believe in Predestination. It's a very biblical doctrine as Romans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages). Furthermore, the Church has always taught predestination, from the very beginning. But to say that I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free will. Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also affected by the grace of God. However, unlike the Calvinists and Jansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4). For God must give enough grace to all to be saved. But only the elect, who he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final perserverance, which guarantees heaven. This does not mean that those without that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew their obstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need it, as they had freely chosen hell.

talk.politics.guns	 Yes, I am pro-gun, and yes, I do disagree with this statement. Nuclear weapons in and of themselves are dangerous. Radioactive decay of plutonium and uranium, as well as the tritium in the weapon, tends to be somewhat dangerous to living things. (Can you say "neutron flux"?) Plus these things have no self- defense purposes. It's kinda hard to justify their use as a militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use (low-yield weapons) or at worst for industrial target obliteration (translation: cities and population centers). Not to mention that for it to be used as a militia weapon and expect the user to live requires some sort of launch vehicle . . . 
talk.politics.guns	 No. The issue is reducing crime, not guns. If gun control doesn't lower crime overall, then is doesn't address the issue. 
talk.politics.guns	 I don't think anyone is arguing that there would be no effect. But there would be no _net_ _positive_ effect. You also have to consider the negative side: Law abiding citizens, armed with fireamrs (pistols for the most part), prevent between 80,000 (National Crime Survey) and 1,000,000 (Dr. Kleck) crimes each year. (Those are the extremes. Most studies find the number to be 500,000 to 600,000.) About 1% of those crimes are homicides, so private ownership of firearms _saves_ approximately 5,000 lives each year. There are roughly 12,000 criminal homicides and fatal accidents involving guns each year. For there to be any net benefit, you would have to show that gun control measures would disarm over 40% of the criminals currently using guns. That would be very hard to do: According the the federal BATF, only 8% of criminals buy their guns over the counter. Since gun control laws, by their very nature, only effect legal sales, such a law would remove all the benefits of armed, law-abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect on armed criminals (who, by and large, get their guns illegally.) That doesn't sound like a net benefit to me. 
talk.politics.guns	 Because there are about 40 homicides total (i.e. using guns, knives, tire-irons, baseball bats, bare hands, etc...) in Switzerland each year and 850 homicides, total, in England. That's three times worse per capita in England than in Switzerland. Since dead is dead, it really doesn't matter that 60% of the Switz murders involved a gun or that only 0.9% of the English murderers do. 
talk.politics.guns	 They do. According the the Los Angeles Police Department, illegal manufacture is one the three primary sources of machine guns and submachine guns used in crimes (sumggling and theft from the police and military being the other two.) Washington D.C. police have stated that 40% (If I'm remembering the figure correctly) of the guns they conficate were illegally built.

talk.politics.guns	 I do not think it is at all unlikely that Clinton ro his policy wonk facilitators arranged the Waco raid as a display piece for the Gun War on the Constitution. Look at what the Bush administration did to get material for the Drug War on the Constitution--remember that baggie of crack George waved at the cameras? They took a dealer from the ghetto and brought him to the White House so they could say drugs had been dealt onb the White House Lawn. And I don't think anybody could honestly think Clinton would have any moral qualms about the raid... The only really worrisome thing is that the BD's heroic defense of their ranch will make Clinton's Gun War on the Constitution _more_ successfull--exactly as he wanted. The media and politicians will filter this so that the general public will think the BD's are bad guys! Don't help them. Stand up for the BD's with your friends and family adnd in public anytime you can--their supposed moral qualms are not important to the issue.

talk.politics.guns	 Does anyone really believe the Swiss have had no war within their borders because every adult male owns a rifle? I'm a great admirer of the Swiss, but 500 years of peace on their turf has zilch to do with gun ownership. Can you picture Hitler, with Panzers and Focke-Wulfs poised on the border, losing sleep over a few thousand expert rifleman? Sure. Hitler stayed out of Switzerland because the Swiss run the money in this world. We'd do well to emulate them on that and forget about getting more rifles on the street.

Certainly he could have conquered Switzerland, but a million armed militiamen (especially in a mountainous area, where tanks' effectiveness is limited) would have made it a real pain. The question a conqueror would ask, is "is it worth the trouble?" The more difficult an invasion is, the more likely the answer would be "no." Certainly a million riflemen (as opposed to a professional army of only ten or twenty thousand, the best a country the size of Switzerland could support), makes invasions more difficult.

Hmm?

In terms of how likely are you to be killed, (regardless of how it's done, 'cause DEAD is DEAD), the UK has a higher homicide rate. Period. You are more likely to be killed in the UK than in Switzerland. If you were to be murdered with a handgun, then yes, Switzerland has a higher rate. But, to belabor the point, you are MORE LIKELY to be murdered in the UK. In that sense, the weapon is irrelevant. The UK is more violent, period. 
talk.politics.guns	 Just want to back this up with a personal anecdote. My grandparents have a Navajo rug made in the 1920's, which they received in trade from the weaver while living in Flagstaff, Arizona. The decorative motif consists of 4 large black swastikas, one in each corner. What's more, the color scheme is black, white, and red. To the casual glance it would undoubtedly appear to be a Nazi relic of some kind. Yet they owned it ten years before Hitler and the National Socialists came to power.

talk.politics.guns	 I think that HCI people honestly believe that passing more gun control laws will be in the best interests of public safety. Why do I think this? Because I used to buy the HCI line. During my freshman year (1987), their line made so much sense -- only people who "need" guns should be able to get them, and the people who "need" them are the police and other elites. Unfortunately for us, this position is highly emotional and not well thought-out. They never stop to think that HCI's position basically says that the non-elite are incompetents (that's you and me, folks!) and that the Second Amendment has absolutely nothing to do with hunting or other "legitimate" uses (which excludes overthrowing tyrannical governments and defending yourself when the police have proven they can't protect you).

There were two major native factions opposing each other and the germans, It was basically useless to the germans (no production) and a drain on their resources (a armored division and a couple of infantry divisions) Which if my memory is correct, were kind of stuck there up until the allies accepted their surrender. (I think that the allies also let the germans keep some of their weapons for self defense unitil they were able to get to the lowlands, away from the resistance factions. This is from memory, and it is unreliable. 
talk.politics.guns	 Or, how about the Clint Eastwood line in "Pink Cadillac" - "I believe in gun control. If there's a gun around, I wanna be the one controlling it." 
talk.politics.guns	 Not just because of the riflemen. They also have many hard bunkers in the mountains that would be nearly impossible to penetrate. As for tanks, they would be rather useless in such mountainous terrain.

talk.politics.guns	 Proper counter to this claim: "Forensic analysis of the WTC bomb by means of taggants would have been as impossible as semantic analysis of NYT editorials by means of taggants -- the difficulty in both cases being to have persuaded the bull to consume the taggants before production of either item." 
talk.politics.guns	 how so? i think you're making assumptions here that might not necessarily be true. -my- personal choice would be a semi-auto, but revolvers are just as effective, if not more so. 
talk.politics.guns	 If alcohol were again banned today, it would be MUCH more difficult to manage a large-scale smuggling operation. The cops now rank just a narrow notch below the military in communications, intelligence gathering and firepower. 
talk.politics.guns	 I wrote : Nice strawman indeed. The discussion is not about whether there were tanks used in sixties riots; instead, it is about whether those tanks fired their main guns in one of those riots. You claim they did. That claim is ludicrous. 
talk.politics.guns	 Define "armed better". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the Colt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other guys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson in hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to 3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful). 
talk.politics.guns	 Which crap, the ridiculous assertions that Uzis are mowing down cops right and left? The assertions that dialing 911 should be the proper and only option available to the law-abiding citizens? 
talk.politics.guns	 Well, if we're going to discuss being a police officer in America today. 
talk.politics.guns	 Here's a question: If most marijuana is domestic and producing it here is economical, why would we expect it to be imported? 
talk.politics.guns	 What about guns with non-lethal bullets, like rubber or plastic bullets. Would those work very well in stopping an attack? 
talk.politics.guns	 me: What seems to be happening here is the situation getting totally blown out of proportion. In my post I was referring to your regular patrolman in a car cruising around the city vs. gang members. Of course the police have access to the things that you mentioned but do they use tanks and such all of the time? Of course they don't and that's the point I was trying to make. Every day when I go out to lunch I always see cops coming in. The majority that I see are still carrying revolvers. Not that there is anything wrong with a revolver but if you're a cop that is up against some gang member with a couple of automatics in his coat (I mean semi-auto handguns) you're going to be at a disadvantage even with training. 
talk.politics.guns	 Preliminary data regarding similar research into kangaroo overpopulation in Australia do not in any way support the cost-effectiveness of this approach. It _may_ be cost-effective for deer--if you quietly overlook the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is _negative_ (i.e. a profit) because the (majority of) hunters pay for licences. The cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have to be employed to cull the animals, which is not in fact the case. You figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive pellets or spread baits? 
talk.politics.guns	 The *POWER* of the word processor and a stamp at work. The fact that around here the state rep generally lives no more than nine miles from any constituent doesn't hurt, either. 
talk.politics.guns	 i]Since there was no sniper fire, doing nothing was equally effective, as was yelling "stop that". Of course, if one wants to credit the tanks with stopping non-existent sniper fire, we might was well credit it with stopping an invasion by Martians. 
talk.politics.guns	 OK ... a near-majority actually OWN firearms, but I will still claim that the VAST majority never needs to use them or even threaten anyone with them. What do they do right ... or are they just lucky ? In either case, this means the 'average threat level' in this country is rather low.

talk.politics.guns	 Any projectile traveling at or near typical bullet speeds is potentially lethal. Even blanks [which have no projectile] can cause death if the muzzle is in close proximity to the victim. I have heard of rubber or plastic bullets being used effectively during riot situations [where the intent is crowd control, rather than close range self defense]; i've also seen reports of deaths caused by them [the British in Northern Ireland]. Use of a firearm for self defense is appropriate and lawful only in the gravest of situations; at that point, i consider deadly [lethal] force to be a proper reaction [and so does the law]. Furthermore, use of less effective [but still potentially lethal] force has its own set of problems. It may well take more applications of the less effective force to stop the incident; this places all parties at some risk; the victim because the attack has not stopped, and the assailent since the aggregate damage done by the multiple applications may well be more deadly. 
talk.politics.guns	 Hmm. I beg to differ. It will probably make a big difference at some point. 
talk.politics.guns	 stocked firearms store, I discovered a printed document that was being distributed by the good folks who work there. Traders, BTW, is located in San Leandro, CA. 
talk.politics.guns	 However, don't forget that the police in Chicago can carry just about anything they want except for the Glock, which is not approved for carry (Guess they figure all cops are like the Police Chief of Winnetka, who happened to let off a stray round of 9mm. This is the same anti-gun police chief that wanted full-auto Uzis for his patrol cars...). 
talk.politics.guns	 Why? Either the numerator or the denominator could fluctuate. The dollar value of a gun would (of course) go up if supply were restricted. The weight of a gun might go down significantly as technology improved. I don't think you have a basis to assert this. 
talk.politics.guns	 This is not borne out of reality; the old Soviet Union had a very serious domestic handgun and submachinegun trade, guns that were of commercial grade because they were produced in honest-to-goodness machineshops. Why would all production have to be local; don't we have a road system that is the envy of the world? 
talk.politics.guns	 Follow more than one months posting. As more than one reader has noted, there IS some reporting bias here. I have seen months where these numbers were reversed. I don't keep a constant tally, but it seems this particular issue had more shots fired than any other I can remember. 
talk.politics.guns	 Woops. I'm not sure if I screwed up, but this is either forgery or some sort of mistake (aborted post that didn't abort) on my part. 
talk.politics.guns	 I've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even contributed a few comments) but this stuff "I'd rather face a knife than a gun" has GOT to come from ignorance! I used to think pretty much the same thing, then I got 'educated.' 
talk.politics.guns	 That's nice, but it doesn't answer the question. There is a difference between "the feds can mandate literacy" and "the feds can't interfere with literacy/book possession". 
talk.politics.guns	 I would also like to point out that this is receiving stolen property and is no different than a pawn shop owner doing the same thing. 
talk.politics.guns	 The idea of the card is bull in and of its self, but I'm curious to know, do they plan on making it a requirement to *always* have it on you, or is it only going to be required to be *presented* when trying to ge medical aid? 
talk.politics.guns	 The San Francisco Examiner reports that Clinton has issued instructions to federal law enforcement that they may not kill or injure anyone to resolve the Waco situation. So they've built a fence around the compound, and are now seriously considering building up the fence to prison-camp levels, pulling out most of the manpower, and waiting however many months it takes. 
talk.politics.guns	 Yes, I agree the first half of the amendment does modify the noun militia. But the difinition of modify that applies to how "well regulated" modifies "militia" is: to qualify or limit the meaning of. For example, "wet" modifes "day" in the phrase "a wet day." 
talk.politics.guns	 No, I originally argued that the Second Amendment was "a little bit and an anachronism." These prohibiting laws are examples why the are an anachronism. After all, laws in made by representatives of the people. These representatives of the people have already decided that the Second Amendment does not apply or is too broad in some cases. Since these representatives feel an unconditional interpretation is not wanted, then it is probable that they majority of the people feel the same way. If this is so, it is an example of the people using their power of government. If this is not how the people feel, the people should stand up and state their wishes. 
talk.politics.guns	 Well, I didn't bother writing to Boxer, Feinstein or Eshoo, the terrible trio who allegly represent me. Instead, I wrote to Bentsen. My letter was not exactly strongly-worded; I simply stated that the BATF approach was immoral (military-style assault, firing into a house where they knew there were kids). 
talk.politics.guns	 Also, you need to consider our legal system. Since any of these things CAN be lethal, you are going to have a hard time explaining why you applied lethal force when you DIDN'T think it was necessary. (If you thought lethal force was necessary, you wouldn't be using rubber bullets, would you?) Ouch. If you are justified in shooting them at all, you are justified in using the best self defense ammunition you can get your hands on. It might actually IMPROVE the legal outcome. 
talk.politics.guns	 You're getting warmer. The 'little thing in the trigger' has to be depressed before the trigger can move. What this means is the damned thing won't go off until the trigger is pulled. This makes it just about (there HAVE been some problems, but we're assuming the gun is functioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver. The gun when working correctly is totally drop safe. 
talk.politics.guns	 This isn't rec.guns, so maybe this is getting a bet technical, but I can't resist....

talk.politics.guns	 Steve,' "It's nice that you find me laughable but I don't quite understand. Is it because you think my firearms clash with what I'm wearing, or that my NRA sticker isn't on straight? Please state your judgement! I find it sad that people won't accept the responsibility to defend themselves. And I laugh with the same contempt you have for me at the sheep who expect the government to protect them. 
talk.politics.guns	 I'll point out that the whole point of the difficult amendment process was to require a super-majority to change the Supreme Law, making it impossible for a "majority" of the people to simply change the law on a whim. Simply changing the meaning based on "the representatives" of the people effectively destroys the amendment process. The State's, you know, are also entitled to a say under that process. 
talk.politics.guns	 Tennessee, at least, does not require any sort of safety class to get a driver's license. All that is required is one twenty question quiz and to drive a car around the block without crashing. 
talk.politics.guns	 There's only one way I know of to tell an AR-15 from an M-16. Pick it up, hold it about a foot from your face and look closely at the saftey lever. If it has two positions, its an AR-15, if it has three, its an M-16. There are numerous internal differences as well, but since one would have to field strip the weapon to see them, they are not valid in this discussion. So, in conclusion, there is very little external differences to distinguish an AR-15 from an M-16 except at close (very close) range. 
talk.politics.guns	 What I find so hard to understand is how come some people, apparantly NOT connected with government or otherwise privileged, will go to great lengths, redefinitions, re-interpretations, in a full-bore attempt to THROW AWAY THE PROTECTION OF THEIR OWN RIGHTS under the Constitution!!! 
talk.politics.guns	 I can testify to this. My cousin spent a few weeks in the hospital, and his friend was killed, because of a drunk driver. The son-of-a-b**** is back on the streets... Officers from the scene are still p***ed about that one. 
talk.politics.guns	 There are, but not any that would help Texans: In many states, such laws have been found to violate the state constitution. But the federal Second Amendment does not apply directly to the states. It was written to limit the federal government only. The Fourteenth Amendment was written to extend the restrictions of the Bill of Rights to the state level. However, the exact wording of the Fourteenth Amendment is very vague. The Supreme Court has been dancing around the issue without facing it directly for over 100 years. In practice, the Bill of Right (indirectly applies through the Fourteenth) applies to the state governments only if the Supreme Court has ruled that particular provision. The Court has made no such rulings on the Second Amendment. 
talk.politics.guns	 That's open for debate. Certainly, an excessive number of people are murdered every year but people also do save innocent lives with firearms. The media just don't tell us when it happens... 
talk.politics.guns	 Even if they outlawed private posession of firearms, there would be no moral force behind that law; I imagine compliance would be low. 
talk.politics.guns	 Nope. Here in Northern California, a newspaper recently did a survey, asking if people favored stricter gun controls. A full 40% said no. Here, in one of the most Liberal (it wasn't always a swear word :( areas of the country, nearly half the people don't want additional controls, let alone revocation of RKBA... 
talk.politics.guns	 Is the license required for driving a car exclusively on private property, such as a farm? Here in the United States, the license is required only for the use of public roads. 
talk.politics.guns	 As a data point from Tennessee, a friend of mine and a police officer essentially recommends that if you can, fade away. Even if you were perfectly justified you're likely in for a great deal of hassle. (A side note, carrying a gun concealed is a misdemeanor.) 
talk.politics.guns	 Not so. Surveys have shown while the public thinks certain types of gun control may be acceptable they do believe they have an individual right to keep and bear arms, and that the police should not have /discretion/ over who may and may not own firearms. 
talk.politics.guns	 Not provable. It's about as "provable" as the number of votes vast for Bill Clinton in the last election. If you accept the information available, you can prove one way or the other. If you refuse to accept it, nothing is "provable." 
talk.politics.guns	 Mr. Parsli, I have to take exception at this. There are verifiable, previous *examples* of levels of U.S. governments abusing gun-control restrictions. I don't think it is paranoid to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused in thye future. After so many times of getting burned any sane person will stop putting his hand on the stove. 
talk.politics.guns	 For me, it would be an obvious choice: Armed self-defence is clearly and strongly protected by the Colorado Constitution and the laws of the state. In the very clear-cut situation of your hypothetical, I wouldn't have anything to fear from the police (unless I had been publicly carrying the weapon concealed, something I'm not in the habit of doing... Even then, the worst I'd have to deal with was a class 2 misdemeanor.) Even if the situation were not so clear, and I might have to worry about arrest for manslaughter or homicide, it would still be safer to wait for the police. If I were to leave and try to avoid police involvement, I'd be committing several felonies and ruining my chances of claiming self-defence in court ("If it really was self-defence," the prosecuter would ask, "why did you run away and hide from the police?") 
talk.politics.guns	 Are you certain you didn't mean to post to alt.french.captain.borg.borg.borg? 
talk.politics.guns	 I think the point is being missed - that it is apparantly acceptable for Big Government (Big Brother?) to use TANKS to control the people, as long as they don't use the BIG GUN (but everything else is allright...).

talk.politics.guns	 Hi. I've just finished reading S414, and have several questions about the Brady bills (S414 and HR1025). 
talk.politics.guns	 You consider laughing at others civilized behavior? What was I supposed to learn from your article? Treat people like dogs? 
talk.politics.guns	 You know, in many ways this might be just the kick we need to straighten things out in this country. Also, people would have a need to replace guns with something else, perhaps deadly sprays that would make Mace and OC seem like water. They would be lighter and easier to conceal. 
talk.politics.guns	 The point that I forgot to bring up here (and this has nothing to do with being a gang member or not) is that it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon in this area (or in the state of illinois for that matter). This is not to say that people in Illinois don't carry concealed weapons illegaly but practicing like that when there are other people around wasn't too bright of an idea. 
talk.politics.guns	 Ah I love posts like this. Many people have already replied to this one as I knew they would. I'm not going to say much as this just seems like baiting to me. Someone decided to post to see how many people would get mad and reply. I am just going to ignore it but I do have one thing to say. See below. 
talk.politics.guns	 Ah, that British sense of humor. Probably got a real gut-buster going when the IRA blew that kid up a couple of weeks ago, huh? Of course, in Britain, your government has ordered you defenseless, so your way of coping with violent criminals is to laugh at victims. 
talk.politics.guns	 I talked to the federal Dept. of Justice (DOJ, Ottawa) to try and clarify a bunch of things regarding changes to Canadian gun laws. I am posting here for informational purposes; questions to email, followup to t.p.g.

Alas, this is not provable. I think that that there are actually *few* cases where this is so. 
talk.politics.guns	 The debate over the Second Amendment rages on. Arguments continue over what a "well-regulated militia" is and what TRKBA means in practical terms. However, the ONLY authority in this area, is a binding court decision on the matter. Even a decision in this area is subject to an overturning by a higher court. Is there anyone who has the facts of a legal precedent, preferably a Supreme Court decision on the specific meaning of the 2nd Amendment? 
talk.politics.guns	 I will join the ranks here. If someone has the ability to actually put this thing together and get enough support, I'll also contribute $1000 to the effort. And jeeze, people, I'm a *student*, with *no job* yet, and I will put up my own hard-earned savings if it means we have a shot at getting the truth told on the airwaves. Count me in. 
talk.politics.guns	 As I'm sure others will have pointed out to you by now, none of the above measures are required for you *on your own property*. You do not have to have a license, your car does not have to be registered or inspected, and you do not have to have insurance or safety training classes, when you own and operate that vehicle on your own premises. If you are going to make use of this dubious analogy, at least make it accurate. And by the way, in Texas you can drive a car in public (with the proper credentials), but an ordinary civilian can't carry a gun legally in public to save his/her life.

talk.politics.guns	 No, but I have several other breakdowns of accidental shootings. I've never seen one that specifically provides the info that Davis insists that he has, so I'd love to have a cite. 
talk.politics.guns	 Well, if police think they are so special that only _THEY_ are worthy of self-defense, perhaps we start putting the arm on police; maybe we should start demanding that police are only police when ON-DUTY, that after that they are just like the ordinary disarmed helpless chumps they consider "civilians." 
talk.politics.guns	 Medical info without a name/body attached is completely useless for treatment. 
talk.politics.guns	 Every city and suburban police officer I've seen around the Twin Cities in the last two years has carried a semi-auto of some type (different brands though I haven't seen any Glock's). 
talk.politics.guns	 Ask the Brits. Enough people have been killed by rubber bullets that they now use them under only certain "controlled" circumstances. And they are fired from something that looks like a tear gas launcher. 
talk.politics.guns	 Ahem!!! Hrumph!!!! You have encurred the wrath of Glock owners. We will beat you with our hammers. Oooops, don't have any :-) 
talk.politics.guns	 Are you sure about this? I'm currently looking at a copy of last Thursday's SF Chronicle and there is the typical one column Traders ad on page C7 in the Sports section. Not only that, but there is a part in the middle which rather prominently says "WANTED: We pay cash for assault rifles and pistols.". Granted, I haven't seen today's paper yet. But I'd be surprised if there wasn't a Traders ad in it. It's probably worth it to write to the Chronicle (and other papers) anyway, because all their anti-gun editorials are disgusting. 
talk.politics.guns	 As perhaps some insight into how this sort of thing works, the local college newspaper had a big crusade to have the U.T. police release crime stats. (The school claimed that to do so would violate federal education records privacy laws). They swore up and down they weren't interested in student discipline records, only for stats so people could make an evaluation of how safe the campus was. 
talk.politics.guns	 There is no such thing as "completely secure," especially when dealing with High Technology. It's all a question of cost: what cost are you willing to bear to protect your information vs. what rewards the "bad guys" are going to get if they break it. The rewards of breaking such a single ID system would be high indeed. 
talk.politics.guns	 Money orders operate pretty much like checks, with both parties being supposed to sign them. I assume you'd have to show the buy-back people an ID, and you'd then have a money order made out to that ID.

Uh, please explain why the smugglers do not also rank a notch below (or above) the military in terms of communications, intelligence gathering (e.g., why fight officials when you can bribe them..."I'll give you a hundred grand to let that semi past..."), and firepower.

talk.politics.guns	 So, you have the right unless the Federal Government says you don't. I don't think I like this very much. 
talk.politics.guns	 I agree very much. I have read almost every article written about the Glock, and IMO, it is probably the safest auto-loader made. It has the best safty of all, Jeff Cooper's First Rule, "Keep your finger OFF the trigger until you want to shoot." If everyone just observed this, there would be fewer "accidents". 
talk.politics.guns	 Oh, OK. Just wondering. I am not a real expert on weapons, I was just wondering if they would do the job. 
talk.politics.guns	 You know, I was reading 18 U.S.C. 922 and something just did not make sence and I was wondering if someone could help me out. 
talk.politics.guns	 OK, here's something for all of those people who think cops are always more responsible then the rest of the population. I found this article in the Rocky Mountain Collegian, Colorado State University's newspaper. 
talk.politics.guns	 So? Look in the trunk some time. Heck - look at the dash. That funny thing attached with a quick-release is a gun. The ones in the trunk are "better".

talk.politics.guns	 I would like to know what restrictions there are on purchasing handguns (ie waiting periods, background check etc..) in the states of Nevada and Oregon. Thanks. -Bill 
talk.politics.guns	 All very true. I'm going on what I have read and heard from friends. Basically the Glock is great but I have heard/read that it is a lot harder to learn proper handling because of the type of safety that it has. I was looking at a Glock .40S&W and the S&W 4006 a couple of weeks ago and the safties on the guns were very different. The saftey on the 4006 seemed a lot more "safe" (for lack of a better word) than the one on the Glock. Of course this could also be a bad thing if you were to pull the gun on somebody. You would spend more time fiddling around turning the safety off. Personally I like the Glocks because they are very light and I think they look really cool (guess that's why they use them in so many movies) but I wouldn't get one as my first semi-auto because of the safety. I would prefer more training with a "traditional" semi-auto (ala Colt .45) but of course that's just my opinion. 
talk.politics.guns	 Never? This is incorrect. Either you don't read very well or resort to falsehoods in an attempt to make a point. 
talk.politics.guns	 Hmmm, the SJ Merc. carries Targemasters West, National Shooting club, Reeds sportshop, Sportsmens supply and Big 5 ads. They all sell guns. No they don't have any adds like in Shotgun news. If they won't at least run the current adds I swear I'll cancel my subscription and end to cash to the CRPA. 
talk.politics.guns	 At the risk of starting the 'my gun is better than yours' flame war, I must disagree. 
talk.politics.guns	 Anyone who worries about his own gun should not have one. If you carry any pistol with a empty chamber and safety the chances of it going off are about zero. Unless you sit it on top of a lite stove for a couple of minutes or put it in a fire. :-) 
talk.politics.guns	 We all know this will never happen. Because the Police are under the wings of Government, they will always be considered more important than Citizens. 
talk.politics.guns	 Two questions: When was this, and do you have the relevant numbers. (Please note, this is *not* in any way an indication I don't believe you or that you're not correct, but when the drop occured is relevant.) 
talk.politics.guns	 Maybe I'm too "religious," but when I see a bill to "establish a right," I wince. Keep in mind, what the law giveth, the law can taketh away. 
talk.politics.guns	 I can't speak for the organizations you cited but everywhere you look in our society and government, one can see the relentless movement toward one world government. The fact that the media demeans such charished values as patriotism, nationalism and protectionism are some of the clues. The fact that we are sapping the economic strength of americans to prop up a former and possibly future enemy is just another. The fact the words like community of nations, global village and international business are in vogue are others. International corporations are destroying our identy and economy and the propaganda they are playing through the media and government is over powering our ability to resist. Our porous border both people and trade are an indiciation that we have already lost a great deal of sovergnty. 
talk.politics.guns	 So, like, what do you do during those six months to be "active?" My town has a similar requirement, and it's rather stupid. Before you can buy a handgun, you have to be an active member of a gun club. Well, how active can you be without a gun, chief? 
talk.politics.guns	 Gun Owners Action League, our state rifle association, started the day with a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9:30. It was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began, whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from wherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud. 
talk.politics.guns	 I don't think your objection is beyond the bounds of rationality. The right mentioned in the bill is already established under the Second Amendment; the bill should be reworded to reaffirm the Second Amendment RKBA, and then establish the procedures for redress through the federal court system. 
talk.politics.guns	 This, at least, has already been determined: The Blue Cross medical coverage for all federal employees is a good model for a future national system. To get emergency medical care, anyone so insured must always carry their Blue Cross card. Before entering a hospital, you must notify Blue Cross, or they will refuse to pay your bills. In an emergency, where you must be treated before notifying them, you must inform them within 24 hours or (if you are unable to do so for medical reasons) the hospital must. Failing to do so within 24 hours means they will not cover the hospitalization. In you need your card to notify them (and without the card, the hospital certainly wouldn't know they had to.) Therefore, you are required to carry the card at all times, or do without emergency medical coverage. 
talk.politics.guns	 Considering that the uses include self defense, hunting, target shooting and collecting, I don't buy the notion that the vast majority of people don't "own, use or display a firearm". 
talk.politics.guns	 I don't know what Traders is claiming, but it appears to me that the Oakland Tribune has censored gun ads in the past. Likewise for the San Francisco Chronicle, and I have never seen a gun ad in the San Francisco Examiner. 
talk.politics.guns	 There are roughly 1200 fatal, firearms-related accidents each year. The large majority involve rifles and shotgun; there are under 500 fatal handgun accidents each year. I really doubt all of those occur while the pistol is holstered, so the number of "self-inflicted gunshot wounds by people wearing thigh holsters" is probably well under 250 per year. 
talk.politics.guns	 Note that Bo Gritz was on the Populist party ticket with David Duke (for veep) in 1988 until he found out that Duke was leading he ticket, when he withdrew his candidacy. So Gritz gave up his chance to be Vice President of the US just to aviod supporting Duke. 
talk.politics.guns	 I'm neither a doctor nor a firearms tech expert, but it would seem that given the way a holstered gun points, accidental injuries inflicted that way would be among the least lethal. 
talk.politics.guns	 You didn't even get the capitalization correct! Try reading USCA on the Constitution, or get any other CORRECT version of the Constitution. 
talk.politics.guns	 Down to 170-some odd lines. We must be making progress! On an ironic note, where I deleted lines Emacs continually gave me the message "Garbage collecting... Done." Think it's trying to tell me something? 
talk.politics.guns	 For the first Move incident (no bomb, several members killed in gunfire, circa 1978) the mayor was the very white Frank Rizzo. For the second (bomb included) the mayor was Wilson Goode, who is indeed black. 
talk.politics.guns	 Even though I find this to be funny on the surface, the original poster of the joke has tried and convicted the members of the BD to be a bunch of "nuts". This may be a dangerous thing to do. It is my opinion that most educated or well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government. This should exist because as a bureaucracy, any government given enough time will tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it was created for. This distrust by the people should keep those in power in-line. That and a properly functioning press. When a sensationalism oriented press portrays a group of people as "nuts" or crazies, a violation of those people's civil rights seem justified. Since we, as American's, have the gurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the 2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public's opinion or risk voted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with domocratic process itself, being thrown out by force. Our government as it stands, must appease the public. Therefore the official press releases portray the BD's as fanatics who are a threat to public safety. We must not prejudge people based on one sided information. So far the only information that we are being given is comming from the very agency that was embarrased by the BD(Branch Davidians sp?). It is to their advantage to make the BD's as fanatical and dangerous as possible. If they were portrayed as law-abiding citizen's, then they(ATF) had no justification what so ever of doing what they did. So let's keep an open mind. Jokes like above, even though it may be funny, may mislead the public from the truth of the matter. 
talk.politics.guns	 Which works fine until you end up in the hospital because you were hit on the head and your wallet, with your insurance card, is stolen. This happened to me, and it took six months to sort the mess out. These sorts of plans sound nice at first, but in the end they just create a lot of paperwork and bureaucracy to deal with all the checking and filing they involve. 
talk.politics.guns	 Gun safety classes sound good in theory, but they kind of remind me of the "literacy tests" used in the bad old days to keep blacks from voting. They came with the "grandfather clause": if your grandfather could vote, you could vote. Sort of like the gun safety laws that only let the political ass-kissers have guns. Doug Holland 
talk.politics.guns	 This is probably the best part of your post. Everything else is shrill speculation. 
talk.politics.guns	 There is no law prohibiting having biological weapons or nerve gas on his/her property, or even walking on government property with such items: ipso facto it is now one's _RIGHT_ to have such weapons of "mass destruction." 
talk.politics.guns	 Even if it were a capital offense, the warrant was not even an arrest warrant, but a search warrant. In other words, there was no evidence of illegal arms, just enough of a suggestion to get a judge to sign a license to search for illegal evidence. 
talk.politics.guns	 Ahem. See the War on Drugs, as sponsored by the Bush and Reagan administrations. The precedent had well been set for federal agencies to step on more than a few of what people consider "rights." I won't make excuses for anyone, but most of the damage had been done before Clinton even entered the race in '92. 
talk.politics.guns	 Correction: The *FBI* *says* that two of the nine who escaped said the fire was deliberately set by cult members. Since the press was kept miles away, we have absolutely no independent verification of any of the government's claims in this matter. 
talk.politics.guns	 BDs would have committed suicide, but maybe not until hunger and thirst gave them the choice between sucide or surrender. The BDs was warned in beforehand about the FBI action. They HAD the chance to surrender and get a fair trial. No matter who started the fire, the BDs were responsible for 80+ peole dying. No one else. 
talk.politics.guns	 analog is governments. At the time of the founding of the US, the idea that citizens had rights above those of the government was not that common, but was explicit in the writings of the founders. To a considerable extent, Englishmen also had those rights. 
talk.politics.guns	 This is about the third person who's parroted the FBI's line about the fires being set "six hours after the tear gas was injected." Suppose you want to explain to us the videotape footage shown on national TV last night in which a tank with the gas-injecting tubes is pulling its injection tubes out of the second story of a building as the building begins to belch smoke and then fire? 
talk.politics.guns	 When will you people realize that our right to keep and bear isn't primarily intended to be for protecting against criminals and beasties in the wild? Granted, it is a big part, but we also need military style weapons so we can fight off the government when they come to our door. When ten agents come to my door, it would be nice to be able to shoot all of them for 'not upholding the constitution to the best of their ability'. It will be a lot harder doing that with the puny weapons you listed above. 
talk.politics.guns	 And everybody who talked about the evil arising in Europe was labeled reactionary in the late 1930's... after all, we could negotiate with Hitler and trust him to keep his end of the bargain... at least that's what Stalin and Chamberlin thought... I guess they forgot to teach you about your country being overrun by the Germans in WWII, 'eh Thomas? And I'm sorry you consider outrage at government excesses to be ####... Everytime the Israelis conduct a mass operation against a terrorist group that is actively killing their citizens and soldiers, the world gets indignant, but it's ok for the US to assault it's own citizens who were a religous minority and accused of sexual deviation and hoarding weapons... I find it real ironic this happened the same day Al Gore arrived in Poland to recognize the sacrifices made in the Warsaw Ghetto where the same 'justifications' were raised for an armed assault by black-clad troops with armor support... 
talk.politics.guns	 I believe we still remember Masada, where Jews killed themselves rather than being captured by the Romans. While I do not agree with the Davidians, I must admire their willingness to die for what they believed, which Jews have had to do often. 
talk.politics.guns	 I've already corrected my mistake earlier in this thread. I saw a brief news report which led to the above inaccuracy. I have since seen detailed summaries that show the tanks returned in the late morning. 
talk.politics.guns	 Not to mention that the story was rewritten today. Those two BD's who "admitted to starting the fire", forget 'em, they don't exist anyone. Today, "a few saw someone starting a fire" and "our aerial surveillance showed them starting fires" at this morning's press conference. Tomorrow, even this excuse may evaporate. A reporter pointed out that a BD being brought to arraingement shouted that tanks knocking over lanterns started the fire. Curiouser and curiouser. 
talk.politics.guns	 the gang thing. Everyone else seemed to just skim by that part. 
talk.politics.guns	 The rights guaranteed by the Constitution were considered to be pre-existing. The only agreement was that they exist. Therefore, no law grants such rights. Laws can only guarantee, protect, or infringe such rights. 
talk.politics.guns	 Actually, if I were one of the survivors and wanted to institute a civil rights violation lawsuit against the Treasury Dept., I would claim that the BATF/FBI itself was to blame for any mass hysteria/insanity... 
talk.politics.guns	 Well, chalk one up for driving away sympathies by looking like a paranoid lunatic. 
talk.politics.guns	 Waco is a city of about 100,000 people. The population temporarily raised to about 102,000 people when all the feds, and state police officers arrived. 
talk.politics.guns	 heat then they should stay out of the kitchen!! (pun intended) 
talk.politics.guns	 actions | they did. That is the undeniable truth. 
talk.politics.guns	 What happened in Waco is not the fault of the BATF. If they would of had the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the compound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened. 
talk.politics.guns	 Well, actually, the Davidians (Koreshians?) started the fire themselves, the last I heard ( around 15:00 EST). Eight people ran out into the feilds surrounding the compound. All were captured and two admitted to setting the fire. I don't buy your napalm theory at all (although it would have made a great commercial for my .sig). Why the hell would they have a wood stove burning on such a warm day? Flame throwers use liquid petroleum, napalm is more of a gel. Now to further dispute your theory, the diluted CS gas was inserted around 06:00 if I understood correctly. The place didn't start burning until around 10:00 or 11:00. 
talk.politics.guns	 I've read estimates that Pol Pot killed somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 million. 
talk.politics.guns	 Actions determine whether someone presents a threat... and I don't carry a gun so much for people, cause I tend to fade if there are any about, but due to several encounters with formerly domestic dogs... these critters ain't scared of folks, and can get aggressive. 
talk.politics.guns	 Well I don't want my tax dollars going to that kind of philosophy. maybe if the good folks you are talking about are people like you than I might be inclined to accept it. What does the batf do anyway? Why don't we have a bureau for militant, paranoid, freedom killers like yourself. People like you are more dangerous than alcohol, tobacco and firearms. With the arms build up in Waco they needed to hit that compound with mega fire power. They could of gone in there blasting and killed a few women and kids but it would of been better then letting them all burn to death 51 days later. Maybe we should just have nuked the whole city, I mean, what's a 100,000 good souls anyway? Get real, you sound like a racist. I guess life isn't so precious to you, do you realize that there were 24 children KILLED!!! They will never get to fall in love, they won't see another sunrise, no prom, no first date, no football, baseball no NOTHING. Why doesn't some people think first before they let everyone know how narrow they are. 
talk.politics.guns	 Watch from where? Two miles away? Far enough away that whatever really happenned must be explained through the vengeful filter of a humiliated agency that said (quote!) "Enough is enough." 
talk.politics.guns	 I watched the CNN report and I never heard them report that the ATF started the fire. They did speculate that the type of CS gas might have _accidentaly_ started the fire. 
talk.politics.guns	 The really good part: "At this point we're not negotiating," FBI spokesman Bob Ricks said at a news briefing about a half hour before the fire began. "We're saying,'Come out.Come out with your hands up. This matter is over.'" 
talk.politics.guns	 Dont you believe that the Branch Davidians committed suicide for one minute. I would not put it past the FBI to lob in some incendiary grenades while they feed your their story. Don't ever ever trust what your wonderful government tells you. Janet Reno and the FBI have the murder of a hundred people on their hands. Hope they can sleep at night.... 
talk.politics.guns	 Hmmm... I hadn't heard about rockets. ATF must be escalating their tall tails... anyway If they had rocket launchers and such (as the press and gov claims) why shouldn't they have done something? 
talk.politics.guns	 Hmm... am I the only person that remembers Masada? This isn't the first time a group has committed suicide to avoid persecution/capture... and you seem to miss the point that the raid SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE!!! I find the FBI actions too damn reminiscent of the Warsaw Ghetto... fitting that Al Gore was in Poland for events marking the 50th anniversery of that... Remove any references to dates and you have two raids by government troops wearing black uniforms, carrying automatic weapons, backed by armored vehicles, against religious minorities they claim were practicing sexually deviant behavior and hoarding weapons... Too damn similar... 
talk.politics.guns	 Yeah, me. Both the Slickmeister and Hillary's buddy Janet say they're responsible... I want both their resignations on my desk yesterday. I also want both thier butts up on federal civil rights violations.... something which carries life in prison as a penalty. 
talk.politics.guns	 Japan did this. It required near-total isolation from the rest of the world for 2 centuries. 
talk.politics.guns	 They don't have too. Canadian culture is handed down largely from the United Empire Loyalists who fled from the American Revolution. Canuckleheads tend to have a "cratophilic," or government-loving attitude towards authority. 
talk.politics.guns	 You, sir, are an ignorant fool who knows nothing about either the drug business or the gun business. 
talk.politics.guns	 I guess what I am really asking, like I did above, how does my government who is my servent, tell me the soveriegn what I can or cannot possess? 
talk.politics.guns	 If amnesty was their concern, they should pay in cash rather than moneyorder and they should check to see if the gun turned in was stolen or not. This way if a gun turns out to be stolen, then even if they wanted to prosecute, they don't know who to prosecute. Since the only concern of these(HCI and the like) people seems to be the total eradication of guns( legal or illegal ), why should they bother to check for stolen property. If they knew who the rightful owner is, then they would have to return the gun and hence contrary to their intent to ban all guns. 
talk.politics.guns	 It's hard to know what/who to believe. However, the letter I received from the BATF, in response to one I sent to Bentsen, said that there was a search warrant AND an arrest warrant. 
talk.politics.guns	 I have already called senators, legislators and the Governor demanding that the warrants be unsealed, and that all involved in this atrocity (including the President, Attorney General and Governor) be suspended pending an investigation. 
talk.politics.guns	 I really don't understand all this! I watched on satellite network feeds as perhaps 90 people died before my eyes, while the two Huey's fanned the flames, and the FBI stopped the firetrucks at the gate. 
talk.politics.guns	 The latest news I saw was that two of the eight known survivors (not NO SURVIVORS!!! as you so rudely put in all caps) said they started the fire. 
talk.politics.guns	 Is this a joke? The legal way to serve a search warrant is to knock on the door. Tossing in a grenade to serve a search warrant violates the US Constitution and is hence, illegal. The BD complied with legal search warrants in the past. I do not understand why the BATF used an illegal means to serve their search warrant last February. 
talk.politics.guns	 I wonder if the AMA has an exact listing of "lives saved" in Tennessee, California, and other waiting period states. 
talk.politics.guns	 it burned to the ground like it did ) for WHAT? Regardless of who started/caused the fire, NONE of this would have happened if the ATF can HONESTLY justify their initial assault and handled it properly! 
talk.politics.guns	 What does this <censored from NORWAY think he's doing telling us how to run the place? I wanna know... somebody please 'splain. 
talk.politics.guns	 Hm. A previous poster argued that the fact that the BD's did not rush to escape the burning building indicated that it was they, and not any of the government actions, that started the fire. On the other hand, I wonder if, with a face full of "massive amounts of CS," *I* would be able to escape a burning tinder-box like that ranch house assuming my best efforts. 
talk.politics.guns	 On Ted Koppel last night, the ubiquitous Australian woman claimed that Koresh trained the women (years ago) how to commit suicide by swallowing cyanide or by putting a gun in their mouth. With cyanide on hand, why choose to roast yourself? There are too many unanswered questions here. 
talk.politics.guns	 If anyone is keeping a list of the potential contributors, you can put me down for $1000.00 under the conditions above 
talk.politics.guns	 Please tell me what you think would have happened had the people come out with their hands up several weeks ago.

Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the investigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from any other story? Particularly if a Republican administration had been behind it. What's going on here?

talk.politics.guns	 Here is a letter I sent to David Skaggs, (Dem, CO). Before anybody says something, yes the letter is a bit "sharp" in tone. I have been writting reasonable and polite letters to him for years, and all I get in return in the HCI party line. Since he already is NRA F rated, I don't think that upsetting him will harm the cause. Sorry if you disagree, but recent events in Texas REALLY have me pissed.

talk.politics.guns	 I HOPE THAT YOU ARE IN THE WAY OF THE NOBLE FEDERAL ENFORCERS and are blown away accidently by the governments goons. 
talk.politics.guns	 Moreover, the BATF has admitted having agents in the compound, and as far as I have been able to ascertain, those agents were still in the compound when the first shots were fired. For all we know, these two people may BE the agents, who would certainly be unlikely to stay around and "cook" with the faithful... 
talk.politics.guns	 Ever since the siege at Waco started the FBI spokesman has been stressing how unstable and paranoid David Koresh was. He stressed how likely it was the the Branch Davidians would commit mass suicide. He was concerned with the safety of the children. 
talk.politics.guns	 If they hadn't killed the ATF people in the original raid, I think I would laugh my ass off. (Actually, to be honest, I still might.) 
talk.politics.guns	 The FBI released large amounts of CS tear gas into the compound in Waco. CS tear gas is a fine power. Is CS inflammable. Grain dust suspended in air can form an explosive mixture, will CS suspended in air form an explosive mix? Could large quantities of CS have fueled the rapid spread of fire in the compound? 
talk.politics.guns	 newsgroups would want to see FBI Director William Sessions' statement, as released by the FBI press office. 
talk.politics.guns	 Actually if 'a few minutes' translates into 6 hours, you have it right. BUT you (and I guess your single-source news agency CNN) failed to mention the Davidians pouring kerosene all over and lighting it in plain view. 
talk.politics.guns	 What ever happened to the 'Adobe Fortress' I kept hearing about? I thought this was a 'Cult Stronghold'! If the kgbatf knew it was a tinderbox, why didn't they just have all the talking heads line up and start huffin' and puffin? 
talk.politics.guns	 CS "tear-gas" was used in Vietnam because it makes you wretch so hard that your stomach comes out thru your throat. Well, not quite that bad, but you can't really do much to defend yourself while you are blowing cookies.

talk.politics.guns	 If one reasons that the United States of America at one time represented and protected freedom << individual liberty and personal responsibility (and I do, in fact, think that this is true) and that totalitarianism << absolute government control and tyranny represents freedom's opposite (which it does), did the USA really win the cold war?

As far as you keep talking about the Davidians pouring kerosene all over, stop and *think* for a second if it is possible the stove or lamp was knocked over and started a fire, and the Davidians were pouring water on it (wrong solution but I doubt I can do much better in their states of mind...) to try to put it out? 
talk.politics.guns	 Let's see if I have this straight. A law is created that says "you can not have a automatic weapon" and therefore it's ok for the government to use any level of force to enforce that law. Doesn't matter if the entire population of the planet is destroyed as long as that law is obeyed.

talk.politics.guns	 It is silly to make this statement. Fifteen minutes after the fire started, the "official word" out of FBI headquaters in DC was that the DV's committed suicide. It would seem logical that the lantern story has more credibility. You can't even to pretend to know for sure what happened... although Clinton is doing just that. 
talk.politics.guns	 I believe it had something to do with a politician whose name isn't exactly the most complimentary word nowadays...one Vidkun Quisling. We all know what a quisling is, right? I'm sure everyone can come up with a few examples right about now :-. -Steve 
talk.politics.guns	 I suspect that you think that this is less lethal than the typical "assault weapon". You are wrong. Compared to what most criminals use, a 9mm with military ammo (FMJs), or a military rifle (use is extremely rare), .223 or 7.62mm with military ammo (FMJs), the .32 H&R magnum with "civie" bullets is more lethal. Most of the arms which criminals (and the military) use are among the least lethal arms in existance. 
talk.politics.guns	 Could someone email me a USNail address for the NRA? I'd like to write them a letter encouraging them to see to it VERY EMPHATICALLY that the 2nd amendment is restored to the form that the founding fathers intended. 
talk.politics.guns	 Was THAT your argument. Well, you didn't make it very well. You started from the questionable premise that the fire was necessarily an act of insanity, rather than an act of negligence or an accident. Recall, one survivor claims that the fire started when a tank knocked over a kerosene lamp. Kind of makes arguments regarding relative sanity somewhat moot, no? 
talk.politics.guns	 I don't know how accurate the documentary was; however, Koresh was never convicted of any crimes against children, nor was the BATF after him for child abuse. Their purview (in this case) is strictly in firearms violations, so this information is irrelevant to the discussion.

talk.politics.guns	 An interesting idea consider: At any locality where a buy-back program is being instituted, get a list of guns they received and compare serial numbers with a list of stolen guns and sue the people responsible for the program if those guns were destroyed. Criminal charges can also be made.( Receiving stolen property, destruction of private property etc.)

talk.politics.guns	 I was shocked to see that the subject of my last rely to awesley was "Luser!" That was certainly not my intention. I meant to leave the subject line unchanged. I believe that the NNTP server I use at columbia must have put in that subject line in protest over problems with my header. That was rather rude of them, but beggars can't be choosers, I suppose. 
talk.politics.guns	 I'd hardly call that "giving up his chance to be Vice President of the US"; the chance of the Populist Party ticket winning is essentially nil. Still, it does imply that he doesn't want to be associated with Duke. 
talk.politics.guns	 I think its an attempt to show lives_saved v lives_lost; all other gun related crimes don't result in lives_lost. On the other hand, its impossible to know how many of the successful self defenses prevented lives from being lost. In other words, the lives_lost is pretty clear [its the homicide and non negligent manslaughter number], while the lives saved is some percentage of the successful self defenses. Clearly that percentage doesn't have to be real high to show that lives_saved lives_lost.

talk.politics.guns	 It was around 1969 in the Shenandoah Valley near Woodstock, Virginia. Me, my wife, a friend, his wife, and his 2 kids were hiking in a totally desolate mountain area. All of a sudden, large rocks began raining down on us. Looking up, we saw at least 3 punks gleefully letting loose rocks from what was an obvious stash. They were a couple hundred feet above us. Meanwhile, the women and kids were screaming and running for cover and the punks were shrieking with laughter. Me and my friend yelled for them to knock it off. They responded that we should "Get f***ed!". Me and my friend drew our pistols and fired a couple of times into the trees above their heads. They ran. With no more 3-5 pound rocks coming at our heads, we proceeded on our journey.

talk.politics.guns	 I just got through listening to the 10 o'clock news on Channel 4 here in Dallas. They trotted out a list of justifications produced by the ATF after "months of investigation" for their raid. 
talk.politics.guns	 Just to shed some light on the fire, it was widely reported (AP, etc.) that there WERE several witnesses to BD folks starting the fires. It has also been reported that the fires broke out in several places at once, which rules out a Bradley knocking over a lamp, etc. as the cause. 
talk.politics.guns	 First, I would like to say how much I appreciate having so literate and erudite an individual as Mr. Rutledge with whom to discuss this topic. Frankly, most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic of the original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in the writings of the era. This is most refreshing. 
talk.politics.guns	 Is it? As far as I know, tear gas, especially in large concentrations, is very dangerous (even toxic) for small children. This makes the FBI's supposedconcern for the safety of the children seem rather hypocritical. 
talk.politics.guns	 And who is responsible for it not happening? Certainly not the children. Koresh was calling the shots. He was talking with his lawyer and the FBI. Since others were released safely, there is no sane reason for keeping the children inside the compound. 
talk.politics.guns	 Of course not. The USA's only hope is for Yelsen (how ever you spell it) to fail the referendum, and have the hard-liners take over again. 
talk.politics.guns	 I think the is BZ gas, not CS or CN. BZ gas exposure results in projectile vomiting, loss of essentially all muscle control, inability to concentrate or think rationally and fatal reactions in a significant fraction of the population. For that reason its use is limited to military applications. 
talk.politics.guns	 Consider this: The BDs had more than one lamp; The tanks made more than one hole in the building. Did anyone else notice on the video that it appeared that wherever there was smoke coming out of the building, there was a tank nearby? 
talk.politics.guns	 This is REALLY STUPID nitpicking. Capitalization rules in the late 18th century were quite different from today, and what was posted matches current capitalization rules. 
talk.politics.guns	 Would *you* have come out if you knew the only national TV cameras were well over a mile away, and yet the agents with the guns were only a few yards away? They had contact with a lawyer, so I am inclined to believe they had an idea of what their situation actually was. This also leads to the conspiracy theory that the lawyer had the BATF pinned on rights violations if the BD's acted as witnesses, hence the arson. I doubt that one too, but it is still quite clear that leaving a safe place to surrender is a rather stupid thing to do until that place is no longer safe. 
talk.politics.guns	 I first read and consulted rec.guns in the summer of 1991. I just purchased my first firearm in early March of this year. 
talk.politics.guns	 I think I have updated info on this. My understandingis that former officer Cranston approached a teenager who was being questioned by another officer. Officer Cranston struck Teenager A in the head with a heavy police flashlight, causing a significant, though not life-threatening. THere is no evidence that Teenager A was doing anything threatening at the time. Teenager A was released on bail/recognizance and filed a formal complaint against Officer Cranston. The Police Chief suspended Cranston pending an investigation into the use of excessive force. The above is pretty clear... but what seems to have happened is this. The Chief requested Cranston's gun, but Cranston refused to turn it over until the Chief went the Cranston's home to get it. Sources said Cranston had always wanted to be a cop and was very afraid of loosing his job because of the complaint against him. A few days afterward, Cranston allegedly walked into Wilson's Garage, where Teenager A and friends were known to hang out and work on cars as a hobby. Cranston fatally shot Teenager A as well as TEenagers B and C. Teenager D was shot once in the shoulder/chest. Teenager E was working under the car and was not noticed by Officer Cranston. Teenager D went to a home and summoned police, who went to Wilson's Garage and found the 3 corpses and one unscathed survivor.

talk.politics.guns	 I wrote my congressmen strongly worded letters demanding they dissolve the BATF. 
talk.politics.guns	 And another survivor claims he heard someone shouting "The fire's started!". Odd terminology. That's what one says when you know a fire is planned, not when one occurs by accident. We will have to wait and see what the evidence shows, assuming one is willing to believe any evidence offered by the "distrustful ones". 
talk.politics.guns	 Why thanks for your reply to my post. By the way, I never, never ever said that it was right to shoot "THOSE kind" of babies. However it was the Branch Davidian people in there that insisted on staying there with their "savior" (yeah right budy boy) because he had brain-washed them into believing that what ever he says is the truth, even if means that they are to give up their lives for <<<<HIS cause. Therefore it is Davids fault and not the ATF's who gave them 50 to 51 days to get out, this was 50 days to many for me and for many of the rest of the U.S. I am however sad to hear of the death of any child unlike the sick bastard I supposedly am. 
talk.politics.guns	 Oh? How about the press? If the BATF & FBI were going to shoot people leaving a burning building, don't you think they would get rid of the press first? 
talk.politics.guns	 Wrong. Neglecting that the government and media have bullshitted the people almost nonstop on this issue, Constitutional limitations are there to prevent a 'tyrrany of the majority'. For example, a majority could vote that given ethnics have no rights, are not people, etc. and it would fly using the logic above. 
talk.politics.guns	 The documentary interviewed Koresh and current and ex-members. The documentary disucussed Koresh's "Christ" status inside the cult, cult brain-washing techniques, and unusual sex practices (the leader gets any he wants, and tells others when they can or can't). I will let others decide if using religious authority to have sex with a minor is technically child abuse or not. 
talk.politics.guns	 Title 18, 241 and/or 242 seem to apply. 241 is conspiracy (two or more persons) against rights of citizens. 242 is deprivation of rights under color of law. Both call for up to life in prison if death occurs. Reno, Bentsen, and Clinton are probably all principals to the crime (as they are responsible for authorized actions on the part of their subordinates). 
talk.politics.guns	 God forgive me for being an American who pays taxes to a government that commits atrocities like the Waco Massacre of 1993. 
talk.politics.guns	 That really depends upon where you draw the line while defining these weapons, and also on if you intend the law to be reflective of modern practice five months or five centuries down the road. I'll give you a little hint: see that manure pile in the farmer's field down the road? In the USA, that is a weapon of mass destruction, biological in nature, because if it gets washed into an open well it will contaminate the aquifers that supply thousands of cities with drinking water. So, where do *you* draw the line? In the USA, the EPA has ruled that a pile of scrap iron is illegal. Care to draw a thinner line this time? 
talk.politics.guns	 CNN just claimed he bought 104 "semi-automatic assault rifles". And they say Koresh wasn't god-like... He managed to buy or build a collection of fully-automatic semi-automatic rifles... Quite a feat, I would say. ;-)

Come to think of it, it was only after I moved to Ames, Ia (pop 45K) that I ever took to locking my doors at night. 
talk.politics.guns	 SeAL Team six should have handled it? Delta Force? The BATF had more than enough equipment and men. They did not have good intel, but they did have poor planning. They fucked up. Even in just the most basic military sense, they fucked up. Excuses do not justify body counts. 
talk.politics.guns	 Though I agree this is not the place to discuss guns, I note in passing that a number of gun apologists seem to have ignored the words "well regulated" in their distorted interpretations of the Second Amendment. 
talk.politics.guns	 No chance. If that CS ignited at all, it would have been quite similar to a grain bin explosion. Explosion, I note. The entire compound would have been leveled, not merely burned. As there was no explosion, there was no CS ignition causing the fire.

talk.politics.guns	 Today's atrocity in Waco has finally impelled me to start working on something I've been thinking about for some time. Over the last few years I have heard of one case after another of government running completely amok. Unfortunately, most people are oblivious of the government's crimes and still think of it as their protector. So I intend to put together what I call the "American Horror File": a compilation of cases where the American government has run roughshod over the rights of its citizens over the last few years, focusing especially on deaths and injuries resulting from no-knock warrants, and financial ruin to innocents resulting from civil forfeiture laws, but including any other cases for which I can find decent documentation. I hope to make people blood-boiling, artery-bursting, red-hot enraged at their government.

talk.politics.guns	 I see no difference between Janet Reno's claim of responsibility for the Waco Massacre and the IRA's claims of responsibility for various acts of terrorism against British citizens. 
talk.politics.guns	 I don't remember the figures EXACTLY, but there were about 3500 deaths in Texas in 1991 that was caused by guns..... This is more than those beeing killed in car-ACCIDENTS! (Yes, there could be that low sentences or high poverty could influence the figures but they're still *pretty* high right??) I also believe Texas has some of the most liberal 'gun-laws' in USA......

Given that Gritz is not at all shy about associating and promoting other white supremacists (such as the Christian Identity movement or Willis Carto), whatever reasons Gritz had to leave the ticket had nothing to do with Duke's presence.

Times change, technology changes, viable forms of social organization change. While concerns about preserving Western notions of civil liberties in the face of cultures with very different values is a valid one, it's a waste of effort to try to turn back the tide. It's much smarter to focus on trying to make sure that the emerging forms of social organization are acceptable than it iss to lament the passing of the old forms.

She plans to start with $2500.00 per year dealer fees and $40.00 or so, depending on the type of firearm, per gun transaction. She plans to make it federal. She was elected in Washington state under the trade mark as just a mom in tennis shoes. She can be written to via the United States Senate, Washinton DC. She is looking for your tennis shoes.

He claimed that the fire started when the tanks caused an internal wooden wall/roof to collapse knocking over kerosene lamps and that they had no suicide plan.

talk.politics.guns	 We've heard a lot of talk about brainwashing in Waco but the brainwashing of the general population never ceases to amaze me. Here is an example of action being taken which results in the worst possible outcome and despite people's deep intuition telling them something is wrong the programming will still cut in and say that the agents probably acted in good faith. NO THEY DIDN'T. They either did not have enough information to act in good faith or else they acted knowing the risk. Sums up human stupidity all over and one of these days it will destroy the fucking planet: "Oh sorry. Didn't think they would respond by launching a strike. All our best calculations told us they were bluffing." 
talk.politics.guns	 For goodness sake if they had fired a cruise missile at the compound more people would have come out alive. It was obvious to anyone with the remotest contact with reality that such an outcome was likely (not just possible) however the fire started.

talk.politics.guns	 As I understand it was considered unsafe for the tv networks to get any closer. Surely the networks can judge the risks of reporting for themselves. I haven't noticed CNN being banned from Baghdad hotels yet despite the (all too real) risk of having a cruise missile land in the lobby. Incidentally has that ever been explained or are we to assume that out of the whole of the city an off-course missile just happened to hit that hotel at a probability of about 1 in some very large number?

talk.politics.guns	 I watched it live, and have re-watched it several times, and from the press vantage point, there was only one starting point visible, where the tank punched in on the windward side, and the winds whipped that fire across the whole, dry, wooden, structure in minutes.

As also noted, the knowledge is there for the production of nuclear weapons. It's not even that restricted. The only thing is the expense.

talk.politics.guns	 Minor quibble: The assualt (and it was one) began near dawn. The fire did not break out for several hours. I find it highly unlikely that the BD would be cooking lunch while armored vehicles punch holes in their house and are pumping in tear gas. The lantern story makes more sense, except the fire seemed to spread too quickly, even given the nature of the buildings and the very high winds. And it was daylight, but I guess in the innner recesses it could be dark--shutters probably closed as well.

talk.politics.guns	 On the subject of CS/CN/tear gas: when I received my initial introduction to tear gas, the first thing that came to mind was the location of the exit. If there had been anything in the way, corners to negotiate, doors to open, or any other obstacles to movement, I would have had a difficult time exiting the chamber. And any concentration of tear gas is hazardous to individuals with respiratory problems, and the wearing of soft contact lenses in a tear gas contaminated area is considered a REAL BAD IDEA. So hoping the BD's would peaceably come strolling out the door after being gassed is a bit unrealistic.

talk.politics.guns	 First of all let's assume that you are right that fewer guns would make it in to the country, that sounds great (to those that see guns as inherently evil) except then every one of those guns would be in the hands of someone who obviously couldn't care less about following the law, after all they got the gun illegally, so is more likely to commit a crime with that gun. Great then everyone with a gun is likely to use it in a crime, nice system.

talk.politics.guns	 The "used to kill" is the heart of the misinformation. It's one of those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression. What Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of, I'm sure, is that when people read this they think violent arguments where one member of the family grabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situation which could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, or a tragic accident, especially involving a child. 
talk.politics.guns	 Actually, they won't. What they'll tell you is that if you add up the number of suicides, murders of one drug dealer by another, legit self-defenses of a battered spouse, and so on, you'll end up with a number that is much larger than the number of self-defense killings against strangers committed in the bedroom. (BTW - they didn't honestly count the latter either, but let's not quibble.) They try to claim that comparison is between the costs of self-defense and the benefits, but they're wrong.

With a rapidly spreading fire and large amounts of smoke and tear gas, finding the right exits, or acceptible holes in the walls were nearly impossible. I find this explanation to be completely plausible. Doesn't mean that it's true, but I don't find it intrinsically less believable than the government stories. 
talk.politics.guns	 That's an interesting statement. There's quite a difference between Hollywood's "Old West" and the real one. Yes, there were drunks, saloons, mining camps, and thugs. However, as McGrath showed, the thugs preyed almost exclusively on one another. McGrath claims that this was due to the fact that no one much cared if someone who insisted on getting into a fight got his way, even if he lost, while they really did care when thugs preyed on others. 
talk.politics.guns	 I have also heard about HCI claiming thant anyone they get an address from is a member. If this is the case their membership rolls are grossly inflated and we should not call them and give them a name and address to add to their already false rolls. Perhaps if you could get a copy of their existing membership, then pretend to be an existing member, do that several thousand times, you could hurt HCI. But names are power. Remeber the NRA uses the fact that it has 3 million paid members in order to flex its muscles.

talk.politics.guns	 Can someone post a general idea of what GCA '68 does?" 'Thanks. 
talk.politics.guns	 I'm not a lawyer but to the best of my understanding, the Congress has no more rights than what is enumerated in the constitution. That is the prime reason why the National Firearms Act is based on collecting revenue. Since the Congress has the authority to levy taxes, the NFA is a tax act and the registration requirement within it is to assist in that tax collection. U.S.C 922, in order to be constitutional, must have a basis on a particular authority granted to the Congress by the Constitution. Congress can not arbitrarily ban a substance or product. That is why prohibition came into effect, only by passing an ammendment. What you said about constitutionality of law needs to be clarified. I believe that an unconstitutional law was never constitutional. When a law is determined by the Supreme Court, to be unconstitutional, that law was never really a law. The very nature of the law being unconstitutional invalidates the law at it's inception. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but when a law is deemed to be unconstitutional, anyone convicted of breaking that law is absolved. I don't believe U.S.C 922 has ever been challenged in court. NFA has been invalidated in two Federal District Court cases( one may have been appellate level{ U.S. vs Rock Island Armory and U.S. vs Dalton}). 
talk.politics.guns	 This statement simply amazes me! "Through no fault of ATF, the element of surprise was lost"! What element of surprise? In the paragraph preceding this one, he said "... the special agents announced who they were and their purpose for being at the compound", which was to serve the federal warrant. No element of surprise was even needed for that.

talk.politics.guns	 I heard over NPR yesterday morning that Arlan Specter, Senator from Pennsylvania, has already called for a Congressional investigation. The problem is that Specter was one of the key government attorneys several years ago who did what he could to coverup facts in the assassinations of JFK and others. That is to say, the Chief Fox wants to check out the hen house. Writing your representatives is a great idea. When you do ask that they keep Specter and his cronies far away from any investigation.

My inaccurate information in my posts was due to lack of knowledge. Thanks to you kind (and some not so kind) people I am learning. Some people have given me several good points to ponder and I see how I was wrong. In no way was this inaccurate information supposed to be trying to further the anti-gun cause. I have said several times before (but nobody seemed to be listening) that I am pro-gun and anti-gun-control. 
talk.politics.guns	 Well, let me see. UZI, no. M-11/9, no. M-16/AR-15, maybe. I remember there being a selector swtich on the AR-15. If I remember correctly (please correct me if I'm wrong) the switch would set to an "off" position or an "on" position because the gun (AR-15) is semi-automatic. Wouldn't the M-16 have a position for semi-auto fire and full-auto fire (or maybe 3 round bursts)? If this is correct wouldn't it be easy to distinguish each gun by this alone? Of course if the AR-15 were modified to full-auto fire I wouldn't think it would be that easy but I'm talking about distinguishing between an unmodified AR-15 and M-16. How about the other guns? Do they also have selector switch to switch between semi-auto and fully-auto fire? 
talk.politics.guns	 They'd probably quote Montesque (sp?) who was once asked if Russia was likely to become a democracy any time soon: "No, because Russia is a nation of slaves and the people get what they deserve."

Those advocating force as a means of expanding their side's power are certainly a threat.

If one ever does you will easily see the magnitude of the crime of genocide committed by the Armenians, by massacring an alien population under their rule which constituted about 40% of their total population and they did it only within a time period of a little over two years in which they enjoyed having full control over this population.

By the way, you still haven't corrected yourself. During World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication in Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]

Second point of difference (which makes it different from the holocast(sp?) ) is that at that time international community didnot have enough muscle to prevent the unfortunate event, today inspite of all the might,the international community is not just standing neutral but has placed an arms embargo which is to the obvious disadvantage of the weeker side and therefore to the advantage of the bully.Hence indirecltly and possibly unintentionally, mankind has sided with the killers.And this,I think is unprecedented in the history of the modern world.

Attacks on Yehiam (Western Galilee) and kibbutz Tirat Tzvi. By Mid-March, The Jewish settlements in the Negev had been cut off from land links with the rest of the Jewish population. The Etzion group of villiages, near Hebron, had been cut off, while 42 members of a convoy trying to supply Yehiam were slaughtered, cutting off the villiage. Jerusalem was under seige, being cut off from its supply route from Tel Aviv (the bombed out supply trucks have been left on the side of that road to this day in memoriam). By this time, 1200 Jews had been killed.

Murder happens to innocent people, not people whose line of work is to kill or be killed. It just so happened that these soldiers, in the line of duty, were killed by the opposition. And resistance is different from terrorism. Certainly the athletes in Munich were victims of terrorists (though some might call them freedom fighters). Their deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by resistance fighters. Don't forget that it was the French Resistance to the Nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the hostile occupiers in WWII.

talk.politics.mideast	 WASHINGTON - A stark reminder of the Holocaust--a speech by Nazi SS leader Heinrich Himmler that refers to "the extermination of the Jewish race"--went on display Friday at the National Archives. The documents, including handwritten notes by Himmler, are among the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that the Holocaust is a myth, archivists say. "The notes give them their authenticity," said Robert Wolfe, a supervisory archivist for captured German records. "He was supposed to destroy them. Like a lot of bosses, he didn't obey his own rules." The documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped would be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces after World War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria. Himmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than 100 German secret police generals. "I also want to talk to you, quite frankly, on a very grave matter. Among ourselves it should be mentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly. I mean the clearing out of the Jew, the extermination of the Jewish race. This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been written and is never to be written." [Emphasis mine--rje] The German word Himmler uses that is translated as "extermination" is *Ausrottung*. Wolfe said a more precise translation would be "extirpation" or "tearing up by the roots." In his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism, "Judenevakuierung" or "evacuation of the Jews." But archives officials said "extermination" is the word he actually spoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives. Himmler, who oversaw Adolf Hitler's "final solution of the Jewish question," committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945. The National Archives exhibit, on display through May 16, is a preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum here on April 26. The National Archives exhibit includes a page each of Himmler's handwritten notes, a typed transcript from the speech and an offical translation made for the Nuremberg war crimes trials. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Are you suggesting that we should forget the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people by the Armenians between 1914 and 1920? But most people aren't aware that in 1939 Hitler said that he would pattern his elimination of the Jews based upon what the Armenians did to Turkish people in 1914. 
talk.politics.mideast	 You can dream whatever you wish. We have demands from the Armenians. With the Government of x-Soviet Armenia, we would sit down, go over all our outstanding issues, whether it's land or reparations or recognition, whatever it is. We'd like to sit down and ask for it. By all means, lands and properties were taken away from us and they should be returned to the rightful owners, the Turkish and Kurdish people, who were there 3,000 years, long before the Armenians ever showed up in that area. Entire population of the region was subjected to genocide beyond belief; genocide which was planned to exterminate the whole Turkish people of the region to the last man, woman and child. Armenians tortured and massacred millions of defenseless civilians. To assemble innocent civilians in the mosques and burn them in the buildings was one of their methods. Even today the traveler in that region is seldom free from the evidence of these Armenian crimes. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Let's face it, if the words don't get into your noggin in the first place, there's no hope. Now tell us, 'SDPA.ORG', a mouthpiece of the fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government: what was your role in the murder of Orhan Gunduz and Kemal Arikan? How many more Muslims will be slaughtered by 'SDPA.ORG' as publicly declared and filed with the legal authorities? 
talk.politics.mideast	 the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. And your criminal organization will not get away with the genocide's cover-up. In June 1915, a major uprising took place in Sebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous Nazi Boyadjian. The Moslem districts were burnt down. Hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed and hundreds of civilians also perished. 
talk.politics.mideast	 It is appropriate to add what Himmler said other "inferior races" and "human animals" in his speech at Posen and elsewhere: 
talk.politics.mideast	 That still doesn't mean we should cheer their deaths. Policemen are also in the line of fire and their job includes the possibility of getting killed. Should we be happy when they die? As I said before, the question is not whether or not you agree with the policies of Israel. You may wish for the Israelis to cease occupation, but don't rejoice in death. 
talk.politics.mideast	 How would you deal with Arabs who ALWAYS threaten to drive you into the sea or burn half your conuntry? Would you talk nicely? Would you say please? You wouldn't. The language of the middle east is power and force. Sorry - that is the way it is now. If you aren't strong, you go down. Israel has to talk and act tough. Notice, Israel talks and acts tough in battle, but is willing to talk peace. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Well, I would go as far as saying that Naturei Karta are definitely Jewish fundamentalists. Other ultra-orthodox Jewish groups might very well be, though I am hesitant of making such a broad generalization. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Actually, this is incorrect. French resistance may have played some part in hindering the German war effort, however the crucial role was supplied on D-Day. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Hey tough guy, read the topic. That's the message. Get a brain. Go to a real school. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Well, if you put things into historical perspective, the Turks moved into an area, which was inhabited by Greeks. This is how the history between the two nations started some centuries ago. Since then, it has been a continuous battle between the two nations. From my perspective I can't see why I should say that Greeks have been responsible for what has happened between the two nations. Of course, it would not be reasonable to argue that the hostility should drag till we kick the Turks out of this area. This isn't going to happen, so the best would be to improve the relations between the two countries. A golden oportunity exists with Cyprus. If things can't work there, there isn't any possible way that could work between our nations. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Living through those days at the age of 20 and following the internal and external news gives me that knowledge and position. In 1974, Turkey had a democratic goverment and free press at that time. Forget about internal news agencies, I haven't heard anything from any international source about any concentration camps with Greek Cypriot prisoners in Turkey. However, I heard Adana POW camp. It was not secret and well recognized POW camp. 
talk.politics.mideast	 I guess, I didn't make my point clear. In the case of Israel government, it is not only tough talk for its intimidation policy. After all, not many people are intimidated just by talking. Here how it goes: tough talks, followed by aggressive actions followed by taking pride of those actions and bragging about them. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Boy, you really are a stupid person. Our justice department does not sentence people to death. That's up to state courts. Again, get a brain. 
talk.politics.mideast	 I will try to answer some of Dorin's questions, even though they were not addressed to me specifically, but I feel that I am a bit concerned by the thread since I am a Southern Lebanese from a village that is often on the receiving end of Israel's bombs. In the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied Lebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder. It is disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich or any other act of terrorism or mrder. This exercise is aimed solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth. It seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problem on the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant, and heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation. I will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of what the situation really is in South Lebanon.

talk.politics.mideast	 Ok, someone is fundamentalist, someone else is not. What defines a fundamentalist (Not who!!!!!!!!!). That is an essential question which nobody has agreed upon an answer, at least to what literature / discussion / news i've seen.. 
talk.politics.mideast	 This is an interesting question to ponder. Did Brad/Ali's sickness make Ayatollah-style Islam attractive to him or did this new religion that Brad/Ali has formally adopted give him this sickness? 
talk.politics.mideast	 Of course, it hasn't. Besides Egypt, the rest of the Arab world still officially denies that Israel exists. 
talk.politics.mideast	 It's hard to beat a car-bomb with a suicidal driver in getting right up to the target before blowing up. Even booby-traps and radio-controlled bombs under cars are pretty efficient killers. You have a point. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Peter, I think you are ridiculous here. Stupidity is not a measure of how well someone knows our judicial system. I guess Marc meant that he is against death penalty. But no matter what he meant, your statement not justified. 
talk.politics.mideast	 there really isnt, as seen by the heavy usage of anonymous posting. if iri sympathizers didnt roam around in sci, anon-poster would get used only occasionally (as in the good old days). 
talk.politics.mideast	 Agressive actions are taken by both sides. Tough talk is done by both sides. When an arab leader is menacing to throw all jews in the water is also tough talk, I think. And killing people is mildly agressive (justified, in your opinion if they are israeli soldiers, justified, in others' opinion if they are jews, not justified at all in others opinion). 
talk.politics.mideast	 It was for the purpose of establishing a state, not an exclusive state. If the state was to be exclusive, it would not have 400 000 arab citizens. 
talk.politics.mideast	 The American press routinely uses the word fundamentalist to refer to both Christians and Jews. Christian fundementalists are often refered to in the context of anti-abortion protests. The American media also uses fundamentalist to refer to Jews who live in Judea, Samaria or Gaza, and to any Jew who follows the torah. 
talk.politics.mideast	 With regards to my condemnation of Marc's ridiculous attacks on the American Department of Justice, and further attacks on Jews, to anyone who took offense to my calling Marc stupid, I apologize for pointing out the obvious. It was a waste of the Net's time. I hope, though, that most American citizens have the basic knowlege of the structure of American government to understand the relationship between the Justice Department as a part of the Executive Branch, and the Courts, which are of the Judicial Branch. Marc's ignorance of basic civic knowlege underscores his inability to comprehend and interpret foreign affairs. 
talk.politics.mideast	 One of these days you'll learn that the way to stop Israel from fighting back is to stop attacking. If there were no attacks in the security zone for a year because the Lebanese army could maintain the peace, then Lebanon would be in much better shape. 
talk.politics.mideast	 And all this time I thought it was the US & Britian invading Normandy, the constant, round the clock bombing, and the fact that the Germans were fighting on two fronts. How silly of me. :) 
talk.politics.mideast	 This a "tried and true" method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups: to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace, thus forcing the opposing "state" to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or, in order to avoid the deaths of civilians, abandon the search. Certainly the people who use the population for cover are *also* to blaim for dragging the innocent civilians into harm's way. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Lebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder. It is disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich or any other act of terrorism or mrder. This exercise is aimed solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Because, the x-Soviet Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. And they are doing 'it' again. Are you so blind? 
talk.politics.mideast	 Troglodytism does not necessarily imply a low cultural level. The image-conscious Armenians sorely feel a missing glory in their background. Armenians have never achieved statehood and independence, they have always been subservient, and engaged in undermining schemes against their rulers. They committed genocide against the Muslim populations of Eastern Anatolia and Armenian Dictatorship before and during World War I and fully participated in the extermination of the European Jewry during World War II. Belligerence, genocide, back-stabbing, rebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the Armenian history. To obliterate these episodes the Armenians engaged in tailoring history to suit their whims. In this zeal they tried to cover up the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds before and during World War I. 
talk.politics.mideast	 All your article reflects is your abundant ignorance. The people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July 15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop Makarios. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Source: "Men Are Like That" by Leonard Ramsden Hartill. The Bobbs-Merrill Company, Indianapolis (1926). (305 pages). (Memoirs of an Armenian officer who participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people) 
talk.politics.mideast	 They are news because they are the exceptions. And the 'Islamic Holocaust' is much the topic of the day. The historical evidence proves that during the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts of sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes, set up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts behind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly attacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population indiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with axes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt alive as can be seen below. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Mr. water-head, i never said that israel diverted lebanese rivers, in fact i said that israel went into southern lebanon to make sure that no water is being used on the lebanese side, so that all water would run into Jordan river where there israel will use it !#$%^%&&*-head.

According to the article, Mr. Clinton reaffirmed this after winning the presidency. However, during recent talks with President Mubarak, Secretary of State Christopher stated that "the status of Jerusalem will be a final matter of discussion between the parties".

talk.politics.mideast	 When the PLO moved into Lebanon and became, in parts of Lebanon, an Occupying Power itself, these same practices were common against non-Palestinean and Palestinean alike. They are simply Standard Operating Procedures among Palestineans and have been for a very long time. In fact, the greatest bloodbath of Palestineans will happen when they get self-rule. Can you possibly deny this? 
talk.politics.mideast	 First this man promotes the dissolution of the Jews through an intermarriage process, and then says that it will be just a bunch of 'fundamentalist' Jews who will object. This clown even called for 'buying' the dissolution of the Jewish people. 
talk.politics.mideast	 It's irritating when someone mis-labels "us" as "fundamentalists", isn't it? This sort of thing may help us understand why some muslims rather resent being put under this label. 
talk.politics.mideast	 I was convinced that no one could have a more warped sense of the world. They were 'our' grandparents who were cold-bloodedly exterminated by the Armenians between 1914 and 1920, not yours. And you can always participate in 'The Turkish Genocide Day' along with millions of Turkish and Kurdish people on April 23, 1993 in the United States and Canada. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Tell me, 'kmagnacca', were you high on 'Arromdian of ASALA/SDPA/ARF' when you wrote that? Humane behavior and tolerance of Turks was a legend even 500 years ago when they accepted tens of thousands of Jews from Spain who were fleeing from the Spanish Inquisition. Again, many Jewish families escaping from Nazi Armenians and Hitler's Nazi Germany took refugee in Turkiye during the 1940's. Turkish people have unselfishly given home, protection, and freedom to the Jews over the centuries, including to thousands and thousands of them during the Second World War. Get a life or a cup of Turkish coffee. 
talk.politics.mideast	 And the 'Turkish Karabag' is next. As for 'Cyprus', In 1974, Turkiye stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population there. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately, the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Is that what turns you on? The truth needs to be told over and over again. There are Armenians who of course witnessed the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people between 1914-1920 but their voices of truth are suppressed today in the hollow din of anti-Turkish/Muslim campaign by the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle of the fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government. Well, that is what I saw in the library. What's your problem with this? 
talk.politics.mideast	 If a 'dog's prayers were answered, bones would rain from the sky. Did you know that the word 'Karabag' itself is a 'Turkish' name? Before 1827, before the Russians and their 'zavalli kole' Armenians, drove all the Turks/Muslims out, it was a Turkish majority town. Well, anyway, it is not surprising that Armenians also collaborated with the Nazis. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Chris, solid job at discussing the inherent Nazism in Mr. Davidsson's post. Oddly, he has posted an address for hate mail, which I think we should all utilize. And Elias,

Every time I start to believe I have seen the outer boundaries of your stupidity, you come up with one step beyond. When will it end, man? Can you actually have brain enough to dress and feed yourself each morning? 
talk.politics.mideast	 Armenia is involved in fighting with Azarbaijan. It is Armenian soldiers from mainland Armenia that are shelling towns in Azarbaijan. You might wish to read more about whether or not it is Azeri aggression only in that region. It seems to me that the Armenians are better organized, have more success militarily and shell Azeri towns repeatedly. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Not so fast! You have a rather warped sense of logic! You are telling us that because Israel wishes to have good relations with Turkey even at the expense of Armenians or Armenia, makes it bad for Turks to tell racist jokes against Jews. Thus, we can infer, if Israel had poor relations with Turkey, it would be alright to post such horrible jokes against Jews! 
talk.politics.mideast	 Gimme a break. CAPITAL letters, or NOT, the above is pure nonsense. It seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities while hoping that Turkey will stay out. Stop and think for a moment, will you? Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it is a part of it.

talk.politics.mideast	 I have found Jewish people very imagentative and creative. Jewish religion was the foundation for Christianity and Islam. In other words Judaism has fathered both religions. Now Islam has turned against its father I may say. It is Ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone, religion wars are going to be on the raise. I thought the idea of believing on one God, was to Unite all man kind. How come both Jews and Islam which believe on the same God, "the God of Ebrahim" are killing each other? Is this like Dr. Frankenstien's story? How are you going to stop this from happening? How are you going to deal with so many Muslims. Nuking them would distroy the whole world? Would God get mad, since you have killed his followers, you believe on the same God, same heaven and the same hell after all? What is the peacefull way of ending this Saga?

What about the Greeks in the islands of Imbros and tenedos, they are not allowed to have churches any more, instead momama turkey has turned the church into a warehouse, I got a picture too. What about the pontian Greeks of Trapezounta and Sampsounta, what you now call Trabzon and Sampson, they spoke a 2 thousand year alod language, are there any left that still speek or were they Islamicised? Before we start another flamefest , and before you start quoting Argic all over again, or was it somebody else?, please think.

How come they have free(absolutely free) hospitalization and education?

If the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel, is it not working? Why is it further neccessary for Israeli guns to pound Lebanese villages? Why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone? You see, there is more to the shelling of the villages.... it is called RETALIATION... "GETTING BACK" ..."GETTING EVEN". It doesn't make sense to shell the villages. The least it shows is a reckless disregard by the Israeli government for the lives of civilians.

Here we are, almost at the end of the 20th century, and a whole community, the Azeri Turks of x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag, is facing forced assimilation, torture and murder on one hand and forced exodus, expulsion and genocide on the other, all because of their ethnic and religious background. And one should ask herself: is the world community really so powerless? Where are all those human rights advocates? Where are all the decent people? Are we going to let this human tragedy go on and do nothing about it? The number of Azeris murdered by the terrorist Armenian army and its savage gangs is increasing. On the one hand they wish to distort the truth and on the other, they beg mercy from Turkiye.

If Jewish nationalism is racism, so is Islam; anywhere where people are allotted "different rights" according to race, religion or culture is "racist".

Between 1914 and 1920, Armenians committed unheard-of crimes, resorted to all conceivable methods of despotism, organized massacres, poured petrol over babies and burned them, raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound hand and foot, took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated personal property and real estate. And today, they put Azeris in the most unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history. 
talk.politics.mideast	 C'mon, you still haven't corrected yourself, 'wieneramus'. In April 1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus. A number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German officials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian Paikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku. Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his Armenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the creation of an Armenian SS formation in order

talk.politics.mideast	 I always like your kind of odds. The Greek governments must be held to account for the sub-human conditions of the Turkish minority living in the Western Thrace under the brutal Greek domination. The religious persecution, cultural oppression and economical ex-communication applied to the Turkish population in that area are the dimensions of the human rights abuse widespread in Greece. 
talk.politics.mideast	 No, you have completely misunderstood. I was opposed to intervention in Somalia for the same reason I am opposed to intervention in Bosnia - there is no security interest of the United States there which justifies risking the lives of American servicemen, and there are too many crises in the world for us to take on all of them. In the case of Bosnia, the risks are obviously much greater, and there are other countries in a much better position and with far better reasons to take action than the US. 
talk.politics.mideast	 The idea of the U.S, or any other nation, taking action, i.e., military intervention, in Bosnia has not been well thought out by those who advocate such action. After the belligerants are subdued, it would require an occupation force for one or two generations. If you will stop and think about it, you will realize that these people have never forgotten a single slight or injury, they have imbibed hatred with their mother's milk. If we stop the fighting, seize and destroy all weapons, they will simply go back to killing each other with clubs. And the price for this futility will be the lives of the young men and women we send there to die. A price I am unwilling to even consider. 
talk.politics.mideast	 If you recall, a subject was raised some weeks ago that touched upon this.

talk.politics.mideast	 I agree with Shai, there are many references to Israeli plans on the Litani river but I have yet to find hard evidence. I had mentioned before that there is a report commissioned by the UN to study the Litani river, it is still in draft form. The Israeli gov't also commissioned a study on the river that was done by Dr. Ben Wolfe. The Litani starts in the Bekaa valley in Lebanon, flows Southward, then West across South Lebanon and discharges into the Mediterranean near the city of Tyre. There are other rivers such as the Hasbani and the Wazzani that start in Lebanese territory than join the Jordan river. The most mentioned plan was one that would divert water from the Litani into these, then the water would flow naturally into the Lac De Houle. BUT there is no evidence of any diversion structure (which would need to be at least 3 km long). The area is mountainous, inaccessible and occupied by Israel so I have not seen any independent reports of the existence of any diversion structure there. Another often mentioned diversion is through deep wells. It is also rumored that Israe has 600 m wells tapping into deep aquifers and drawing water on the Israeli side of the border. If such wells are indeed under use they would be costly to operate (high energy costs) and the Lebanese and Israeli gov't should agree on the distribution of water from shared aquifers as part of an overall peace plan and the bilateral negociations on "regional issues". The fact that we have been at war all this time has led to the current state of affairs where withdrawals from such aquifers is completely unregulated.

talk.politics.mideast	 The village I described was actually the closest I could come to describing mine. I agree there may be other villages where the civilian population has deserted because it is too close to Israeli lines and thus gets bombed more often. In such villages often the only remaining inhabitants are guerillas and some elderly who have nowhere else to go. But for the most part the typical South Lebanon village is more like mine. One where civilians and guerillas live together. They are often inhabiting the same house. Many families are large, some have members of the families involved in Hizollah, most others are not. That is what is so hard of South Lebanon, Israel is not fighting an army with well drawn battle lines, but a guerilla tyoe resistance which by definition and necessity blends with the local populace. Not because they are evil cowards that use women and children as shields, but because that is the only way one can fight a more powerful better equipped occupying army. 
talk.politics.mideast	 While I applaud investing of money in Yehuda, Shomron, v'Chevel-Azza, in order to create jobs for their residents, I find it deplorable that this has never been an active policy of any Israeli administration since 1967, *with regard to their Jewish residents*. Past governments found funds to subsidize cheap (read: affordable) housing and the requisite infrastructure, but where was the investment for creating industry (which would have generated income *and* jobs)? 
talk.politics.mideast	 While that is currently true from their perspective, it is also worthwhile to note that in such cases the populace often does suffer from attempts to control the guerillas. Furthermore, there were cases in the past of Palestinian gun emplacements being situated within villages. The argument that can be made for small arms fire can not be made for field pieces.

talk.politics.mideast	 It seems to me that you are the one who is supposed to do some reading. I think that our major difference in opinion is on the legitimacy of Sevres. First, thattreaty was signed by the Ottoman Empire therefore legally it does not bind the Republic of Turkey. The new independence movement (which by the way, is not the same as the Young Turks) naturally rejected it out of hand. to say that we should accept because the Germans did theirs is absurd. We saw what the cosequences of such harsh treaties were in Hitler. Second, the Sevres treaty was even worse than Versailles. It divided the Ottoman Empire in to several influence zones, had the capital occupied, the economy under Allied control, the army di minished to nothing but a police force, in short a country in name only. I'd wonder if you would like to live under such conditions. And for the record, I donot feel sorry for the soldiers killed in IZMIR harbour. Before evacuating the city, the Greek forces burned it down, so it serves them right. As for being fooled by Allied promises, that too is your fault.

That *is* a Nazi doctrine: rectification of the "abnormal presence" of the Jewish people within a larger body politic.

talk.politics.mideast	 WASHINGTON (UPI) -- A senior State Department official on Tuesday ruled out any softening of U.S. attitudes toward Iraq but said relations with Iran's Islamic regime could improve substantially if that government disassociates itself from international terrorism. ``Despite the name-calling and the harsh rhetoric from across the Gulf, despite all this, we do not take a position of permanent hostility towards the Islamic Republic of Iran,'' David Mack, deputy assistant secretary for Near Eastern Affairs, said. The primary U.S. objection is ``Iran's international behaviour'' which includes ``extending support of violence'' to disrupt the Arab Israeli peace process and its rapid build-up of dangerous weapons. Mack said ``Iran could contribute to regional stability and peace but first it is to end the behaviour which threatens this area.'' Mack spoke at the U.S.-GCC business conference aimed at promoting Gulf-American trade. He said the ``Middle East will be an item very high on the agenda of the U.S. administration.'' The importance of the Gulf is underlined by Secretary of State Warren Christoper's visit last year to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait before anywhere else in the world, Mack said. He added that the U.S. has no long-term plan to station troops in the Gulf. Mack also insisted that the Clinton administration will continue to pressure Iraq to ``comply with all the U.N. Security resolutions.'' ``As long as Iraq is ruled by Saddam Hussein we do not expect compliance,'' Mack told delegates.

talk.politics.mideast	 Well i'm not sure about the story nad it did seem biased. What I disagree with is your statement that the U.S. Media is out to ruin Israels reputation. That is rediculous. The U.S. media is the most pro-israeli media in the world. Having lived in Europe I realize that incidences such as the one described in the letter have occured. The U.S. media as a whole seem to try to ignore them. The U.S. is subsidizing Israels existance and the Europeans are not (at least not to the same degree). So I think that might be a reason they report more clearly on the atrocities. What is a shame is that in Austria, daily reports of the inhuman acts commited by Israeli soldiers and the blessing received from the Government makes some of the Holocaust guilt go away. After all, look how the Jews are treating other races when they got power. It is unfortunate.

An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis.

If you think name calling is a valid form of argument in intellectual circles, you need to get out more often.

talk.politics.mideast	 First let me correct myself in that it was Goerbels and not Goering (Airforce) who ran the Nazi propaganda machine. I agree that Arab news sources are also inherently biased. But I believe the statement I was reacting to was that since the american accounts of events are not fully like the Israeli accounts, the Americans are biased. I just thought that the Israelis had more motivation for bias. The UN has tried many times to condemn Israel for its gross violation of human rights. However the US has vetoed most such attempts. It is interesting to note that the U.S. is often the only country opposing such condemnation (well the U.S. and Israel). It is also interesting to note that that means other western countries realize these human rights violations. So maybe there are human rights violations going on after all.

talk.politics.mideast	 Sorry, I misread your remark about young men and women. (Though I am now unsure what that sentence does mean.) 
talk.politics.mideast	 Yes, victims exist. There are a staggering number of victims in the world and more each day. I think on balance, intervention would create more victims, including American ones. Since the first responsibility of the US government is to protect Americans, I think they serve that role best by staying away from Bosnia and other regional conflicts.

talk.politics.mideast	 It would be nice if, as you rightly point out the inherent value of freedom of speech, discussion would also deal with the all-to- frequent ritualized abuses and distortions of that freedom that do occur. There are situations where a few extremely vocal, and usually radical, people **do** drive people away, effectively stifle all other ("opposing") views and generally "take over". *Clearly*, the purpose behind such actions is *to deprive* others of *their* freedom of speech through overt and covert coercion and domination of the "media form" in question. While "freedom" of speech is to be valued, this is not. How would you suggest that this sort of reoccuring problem be alleviated? More particularly, how can this be controlled within the structure of these newsgroups?

talk.politics.mideast	 Right now, I'm just going to address this point. When the Jewish National Fund bought most of its land, It didn't buy it from the Palestinians themselves, because, for the most part, they were tenant farmers (fallahin), living on land owned by wealthy Arabs in Syria and Lebanon. The JNF offered a premium deal, so the owners took advantage of it. It's called commerce. The owners, however, made no provisions for those who had worked for them, basically shafting them by selling the land right out from under them. They are to blame, not the Jews.

My point is that they have made a few pro-forma, perfunctory remarks, and sent in a few C-130's and so forth, but it's clearly not something they're losing much sleep over. They're just going through the motions, while Moslems are being "ethnically cleansed" out of what used to be Yugoslavia. The US has been speaking out far more loudly than the Moslem nations in the UN and other world forums.

I don't mind us helping out; but what invariably happens is that everybody expects us to do most of the work and take most of the risks, even when these events are occuring in other people's back yards, and they have the resources to deal with them quite well, thank you. I mean, it's not like either Serbia, or Somalia represent some overwhelming military force that their neighbors can't handle. Nor are the logistics a big deal -- it's a lot bigger logistical challenge to get troops and supplies from New York to Somalia, than from Saudi Arabia; harder to go from Texas to Serbia, than Turkey or Austria to Serbia. 
talk.politics.mideast	 All humans suffered emotionally, some Jews and many others suffered physically. It is sad that people like you are so blinded by emotions that they can't see the facts.

talk.politics.mideast	 protection under Freedom of speach laws would be useless. It is speach that some find questionable that must be protected, be it religiously blasphemous or inherently racist. It is only through civilized discourse and not scare tactics that one can enlighten those that one perceives to be ignorant. That is the idea behind freedom of expression. What you find offensive might be perceived as truth by some and what they might find offensive might be your belief. It is only through free exchange of ideas (and insults as the case seems to be with this channel) that one can change another's erring ways.That is why Jefferson said that here we are not afraid to "tolerate error so long as reason is left to combat it".

It states that: Israel will remain the existing source of authority until "final status" is agreed upon; Israel will negiotiate the delegation of power to the organs of the Interim Self-Government Arrangements (ISGA); The ISGA will apply to the "Palestinian inhabitants of the territories" under Israeli military administration. The arrangements will not have a territorial application, nor will they apply to the Israeli population of the territories or to the Palestinian inhabitants of Jerusalem; Residual powers not delegated under the ISGA will be reserved by Israel; Israelis will continue to live and settle in the territoriesd; Israel alone will have responsibility for security in all its aspects- external, internal- and for the maintenance of public order; The organs of the ISGA will be of an administrative-functional nature; The exercise of powers under the ISGA will be subject to cooperation and coordination with Israel. Israel will negotiate delegation of powers and responsibilities in the areas of administration, justice, personnel, agriculture, education, business, tourism, labor and social welfare, local police, local transportation and communications, municipal affairs and religious affairs.

You call athnic cleansing of apopulation when it doubles? freedom of right to have property without government intervention, What do you mean by that ? Anyway in Greece, as in every country if you want some property you 'inform' the goverment . fredom of right to vote to choose your community leaders, Well well well. When Turkish in Area of Komotini elect 1 out of 3 represenatives of this area to GReek parliament, if not freedom what is it? 3 out of 3 ? Maybe there are only Turks living there .... how Greek Government encourages people to destroy religious places, houses, farms, schools for Turkish minority then forcing them to go to turkey without anything with them. I cannot deny that actions of fanatics from both sides were reported. A minority of Greek idiots indeed attack religious places, which were protected by the Greek police. Photographs of Greek policemen preventing Turks from this non brain minority were all over Greek press. Before I conclude my writing, let me point out how Greeks are treated in Turkey. We do not consider them Greek minority, instead we consider a part of our society. There is no difference among people in Turkey. We do not state that Greek minority go to Turkish universities, get free insurance, food, and health insurance because these are basic human needs and they are a part of turkish community. All big businesses belong to Greeks in Turkey and we are proud to have them.unlike the Greece which tries to destroy Turkish minority, We encourage all minorities in Turkey to be a part of Turkish society. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Andy Beyer has claimed that the Israeli Press is a bit biased. But the fact is that there are events shaping the politics of the mideast that people who do not read the Israeli press simply know nothing about. Many of these events are not even mentioned here. I read the Israeli press to learn of important events about which you know nothing, because of your total reliance on western media for your information on Israel. Since I read both American media and Israeli media, I can say with absolute certainty that anybody who reliesx exclusively on the American press for knowledge about Israel does not have a true picture of what is going on. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Anas Omran has claimed that, "the Israelis used to arrest, and sometime to kill some of these neutral reporters." The assertion by Anas Omran is, of course, a total fabrication. If there is an once of truth iin it, I'm sure Anas Omran can document such a sad and despicable event. Otherwise we may assume that it is another piece of anti-Israel bullshit posted by someone whose family does not know how to teach their children to tell the truth. If Omran would care to retract this 'error' I would be glad to retract the accusation that he is a liar. If he can document such a claim, I would again be glad to apologize for calling him a liar. Failing to do either of these would certainly show what a liar he is. 
talk.politics.mideast	 I think he is trying to mislead people. In cases where race information is sought, it is completely voluntary (the census possibly excepted). 
talk.politics.mideast	 Please list the names of some of those neutral reporters that were killed in the "O.T.". It is also interesting to note that at the outbreak of the intifada, palestinian parties quickly began orchestrating their demonstrations for the benefit of the media. Having spoken to a Danish reporter who covered the initfada, I know of at least one case where he found out that a "mass demonstration" on the outskirts of Gaza was setup for himself and his colleagues. When I asked whether the footage shot was sent he replied affirmatively, "after all, it did happen." When this became the case, the IDF began closing sensitive trouble spots to reporters. 
talk.politics.mideast	 I thought the implication was that the prince destroyed one fourth of the remaining Persian troops on the second round, and then 1/11 of those remaining on the third round. This would mean 
talk.politics.mideast	 Why retract your accusation that he's a liar? If Omran retracts his "verbal diarrohea" doesn't that only prove the liar he *really* is? A retraction would be pointless! Giving this guy the opportunity to "save face" after uttering such bullshit would just encourage him to do it again! I must say that your style is very impressive, Mark. Keep it up! 
talk.politics.mideast	 Someone else said something similar. I will not comment on the value or lack of value of Elias's "proposal". I just want to say that it is very distressing that at least two people here are profoundly ignorant of Nazi racial doctrine. They were NOT like Elias's idea, they were more like the opposite.

Using fire arms and lethal variants of tear gas and *rubber coated* bullets against stone throwers. Using tanks and anti-tank missiles against homes after a 5 minute evacuation warning. Using Shin Bit's "reasonable" physical pressure in interrogation. And more. Not counting of course past practices such as the bombardment of Beirut in 1982, the bombing of the Egyptian school of Bahr-El-Bakar and the Abu-Za'bal factory in 1978, the downing of the Libyan airliner full of Egyptian passengers near the same time. Overseeing the Maronite massacre in Sabra and Shatilla. That is of course besides numerous massacres by Irgun and other gangs during the British mandate period. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Pardon me Tim, but I do not see how it can be possible for the IDF to fail to detect the presence of those responsible for planting the bomb which killed the three IDF troops and then later know the exact number and whereabouts of all of them. Several villages were shelled. How could the IDF possibly have known that there were guerrillas in each of the targetted villages? You see, it was an arbitrary act of "retaliation".

It may not use the exact words as quoted above but I'm sure many will agree that the same message is being issued. Later on when I get back home I will try to find the precise section(s) but you can do the research for now (I hope). I also realize that Yasser Arafat renounced the _Covenant_ *to the Western media only* but he has yet to inform the PNC officially and enequivocally of his exact intentions on this issue. Therefore, as far as we are concerned the _Covenant_ still stands as the "Bible" (so to speak) of the mainstream Palestinian National movement! 
talk.politics.mideast	 It is nonsense, Danny, if you can refute it with proof. If you are citing your experience then you should have been there in the 1940's (the article is comparing the condition then with that now). 
talk.politics.mideast	 Those who forward offensive posts to the sysadmin aren't curtailing anyones' freedom of speech. The neo-nazi movement has a right to make speeches, say anything they want. They do not have a right to have these speeches published by the N.Y. Times. That depends on the Times analysis of the economic and to somewhat extent newsworthy value of those speeches. Likewise to the sysadmin of this fellows system. If he feels his resources are being used in a manner that is not in his best interests, or are perhaps embarassing to his organization, he will act just as the New York Times does, not to be a conduit for these ideas. The poster is after all free-loading off of someone else's pocket book when he posts. He who controls the purse strings has the right to make the decision how he wants those funds spent or not spent.

talk.politics.mideast	 I've heard many Turks say this and it surpises me that they don't read about it.Remember the Treaty of Sevres-as a consequence of being in the Axis powers in WWI.The Turks UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW were supposed to look after their minorities ie. Greeks,Armenians,Kurds(I must say Turk-Kurd relations are improving slightly with time) and not pose a threat to Turkey's neighbours. The Turks blatantly rejected this treaty(the Germans grudgingly accepted Versailles which was a million times worse for the health and pride of the German people).The Greeks who had an army there,were there with BRITISH and FRENCH backing to enforce Sevres. In possibly the first example of appeasement the Young Turk government managed screwed the Treaty of Laussane out of the weak allies,this was after the Greek forces were were destroyed at Smyrna.When this occurred incidently, FRENCH warships were in the harbour and many Greeks trying escape swam to the FRENCH warships and climbed aboard only to get their arms cut off by the FRENCH as they clawed they're way up the sides of the ships. Libertae,egalitae,fraternatae.

talk.politics.mideast	 Still living in an alternate universe? Numerous articles in major newspapers (London Times) and periodicals (Newsweek) during the war, had suggested the existence of a significant collaboration between Armenians and the Nazis. Arthur Derounian deserves credit for being the first person to deal with this issue extensively. Derounian's motives were twofold: his deeply held democratic convictions gave him a sense of duty and he felt obliged to shed light on this yet another dark chapter of Armenian history. Concurrently, Derounian embarked on what one would call 'crisis control' or face-saving. In order to forestall any potential attacks on the larger Armenian community in the United States, he marginalized collaboration as deplorable but insignificant.[1]

On April 23 of every year, the people of Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the lost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their lives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and prosperously.

talk.politics.mideast	 Proven? Maybe not. But it can certainly be verified beyond a reasonable doubt. This statement and statements like it are a matter of public record. Before the Six Day War (1967) I think Nasser and some other Arab leaders were broadcasting these statements on Arab radio. You might want to check out some old newspapers Ahmed. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Oh yeah, Israel was really ready to "expand its borders" on the holiest day of the year (Yom Kippur) when the Arabs attacked in 1973. Oh wait, you chose to omit that war...perhaps because it 100% supports the exact OPPOSITE to the point you are trying to make? I don't think that it's because it was the war that hit Israel the hardest. Also, in 1967 it was Egypt, not Israel who kicked out the UN force. In 1948 it was the Arabs who refused to accept the existance of Israel BASED ON THE BORDERS SET BY THE UNITED NATIONS. In 1956, Egypt closed off the Red Sea to Israeli shipping, a clear antagonistic act. And in 1982 the attack was a response to years of constant shelling by terrorist organizations from the Golan Heights. Children were being murdered all the time by terrorists and Israel finally retaliated. Nowhere do I see a war that Israel started so that the borders could be expanded. 
talk.politics.mideast	 You are conveniently ommitting the fact that the Arab governments told the Arab citizens of Israel to leave Israel, join with the Arab armies so that after what they felt like an assured victory occured, these Arabs could return to their former homes, reclaim them as well as anything else they wanted that belonged to Jews. When the Arabs lost, Israel was left with a bunch of people who has just tried to kill them who now wanted back into the country as citizens. What would you have done? Let them in so they could kill Jews? Israel sees those Arabs who stayed as citizens because they were loyal to Israel during the war and didn't leave. Of course some Arabs could have left to avoid the fighting but distinguishing between the two is impossible. Therefore a decision was made based on secuturity of the country.

talk.politics.mideast	 I have never seen such immaturity among semitophiles. This Andi Beyer character shows no signs of anti semitism, yet because he deviates from the norm of accepted opinion, you attack him. Why did not anyone venture to answer Andi's question in an intelligent and unoffending manner? The only ones guilty here of not backing up there viewpoints with fact are the Israelophiles. Now will we please start having some INTELLIGENT conversation? You all are an insult to you race! {assuming you are also semitic} Now I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorism during the 1930's and 1940's. The Hirgun, and other branch - off militant groups, did fight the British do get them out of Palestine. Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the Arabs. These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British soldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in favor of a compromise with the Palestinians. In addition, they massacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their very lives.' "I mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm part Jewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the Israelites pisses me off so. I'm not as critical of the Palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the Jews. It 's a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for German and European anti semitism. 
talk.politics.mideast	 You know ed,... You're right! Andi shouldn't be comparing Israel to the Nazis. The Israelis are much worse than the Nazis ever were anyway. The Nazis did a lot of good for Germany, and they would have succeeded if it weren't for the damn Jews. The Holocaust never happened anyway. Ample evidence given by George Schafer at Harvard, Dept. of History, and even by Randolph Higgins at NYU, have shown that the Holocaust was just a semitic conspiracy created to obtain sympathy to piush for the creation of Israel.

talk.politics.mideast	 A number of points. You are making assumptions about the manner in which the cards are used. True, by law, all residents, citizens, and tourists must carry a form of identification with them. For citizens, the standard ID is the ID card. The purpose this serves on a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places, is for the purpose of identifying the bearer. This takes place in banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc... Quite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card for such activities more than once per week. There is no law or requirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public. Furthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against the bearer in any manner by having access to this information. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Typical 'Arromdian' of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle. Well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion and national origin? 
talk.politics.mideast	 Dr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally be believed. I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing Goebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks who are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today's informed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For instance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they watched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can read the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what really happened. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Let us not forget the Nazi Armenians. Nazi Armenians were of service to Germans in Arab countries as well. As Uzun put it, one well-known case which received a lot of media-coverage involved two Nazi Armenian agents which were dropped over Syria by Italian war planes. The mission of the agents was to mingle among the Armenian population in Syria and to acquire relevant information for the German Wehrmacht on the allied forces in the area.[1] Nazi Armenians also helped German propaganda efforts in Arab countries designed to promote pro-Nazi sentiments among the French- and British-ruled Arab populations. Beirut had traditionally been strong-hold of the Nazi Armenians and until very recently it was the center of international Armenian terrorism. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Anyone care to speculate on this? I'll let the rest of the net judge this on its own merits. Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished of butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only the killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian Armenia. They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of Ottoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines genocide as acting with a 
talk.politics.mideast	 It is called 'The Justice'. We also demand that the x-Soviet Armenian Government admit its responsibility for the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide, render reparations to the Muslim people, and return the land to its rightful owners. The recognition of the Genocide has become an issue which cannot be delayed further, and it is imperative that artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed. 
talk.politics.mideast	 Not exactly the same, but reminiscent of the assassination of Count Bernadotte, who was _the_ UN negotiator during the 1948 Israeli war of independence. He was killed by the Israelis. Seems he was being too successful in negotiating a cease-fire, which would have worked territorially against the nascent Israel, compared to continued war. 
talk.politics.mideast	 It wasn't all that long ago that the acts of Israeli soldiers were described as "superhuman". Now, they are "inhuman". Did the Israelis change so radically so quickly or have reporting attitudes changed?

talk.politics.mideast	 I don't like this comment about "Typical" thinking. You could state your interpretation of Exodus without it. As I read Exodus I can see a lot of killing there, which is painted by the author of the bible in ideological/religious colors. The history in the desert can be seen as an ethos of any nomadic people occupying a land. That's why I think it is a great book with which descendants Arabs, Turks and Mongols can unify as well. 
talk.politics.mideast	 I would hope that if you intend to have a reasonable discussion you might wait until I express an opinion before deciding I should be flamed for it. As for 'war' I am not sure how I would define it. If you just look at attacks on villages then there is no way of deciding when it started. Would you count the riots in the 20's and 30's? Violence but not war. I personally think that 'war', as opposed to civil disturbance or whatever, requires organisation, planning and some measure of regualr or semi-regular forces. Perhaps the Arab Liberation Army counts. I could easily be convinced it was so. From what I know they did not have a great deal of planning let alone organisation. The Haganah and Palmach certainly did. That is not a cause for criticism, it merely reflects the great organisation generally in the 'Zionist' camp.

talk.politics.mideast	 WASHINGTON (UPI) -- Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Tuesday there are better ideas to stop the human slaughter in the Balkans than ordering American fighters to bomb the Serbs, but a frustrated senator told him to do just that. ``We've not done a damn thing,'' Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., told Christopher at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ``Preventive diplomacy is not in your capability right now in Bosnia- Herzegovina. Biden chastised the administration and its Republican predecessor for what he characterized as a limp response to the Serbian policy of ``ethnic cleansing'' of Muslims, including rape and shelling of civilians. ``The time has come for us and the world to stop bemoaning the fact that all the options are bad ones,'' Biden said. ``They are all bad ones and we ought to pick a couple.'' Biden also endorsed lifting an international arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia so the Muslim-dominated Bosnian government might have a chance to at least defend itself against the Serbs.

Brett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficit declined. If you keep spending more than you earn, the deficit keeps growing. If you keep _borrowing_ at a lesser rate than you borrowed previously, the deficit increases. You only decrease deficits when your income exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts.

talk.politics.misc	 Very simple. An 'Insurance Commissioner' is a bureaucrat - a regulator. It is his/her duties to make rules to enforce laws. He/she cannot make laws. If there is no law that covers a specific subject, say scam insurance companies, a regulator cannot create one. So they have to go to a proper legislative body to get such a law enacted. For the California Insurance Commissioner, there are two possible legislative bodies: the California State Legislature and the U.S. Congress. We all know how little the California State Legislature accomplishes, esp. along the lines of insurance reform legislation (negative movement). So Garamendi wants the feds to do it, because: (a) he has a better chance of getting a federal law through, and (b) since many of the scam companies work across state lines/national borders, it is better to have a law that reach out into other jurisdictions.

talk.politics.misc	 I agree mostly with Chris. It is (unfortunately, IMO) true that the *FBI* figures for rape based on the 'uniform crime report' report only female rapes. However, some states (such as Illinois) are not tabluated because they refuse to comply with this sexist definition!

talk.politics.misc	 You mean, if a large part of the population supports discrimination against homosexuals, they will be injured. But if a large part of the population supports such discrimination, how did that law get passed? 
talk.politics.misc	 There may be some confusion here. The Uniform Crime Reports program run by the FBI defines rape as a female victim only crime -- even though some states have the laws de-sexed. I suspect that this causes male victims of rape to be left out of the UCR data.

talk.politics.misc	 Can you provide some evidence that the slave states regarded slaves as not humans? They were "outside our society" and similar phrases that basically meant that they didn't have to recognized as having the same rights as a free person, but they were never considered "not human" to my knowledge.

talk.politics.misc	 You're being too generous to the communists, I think. In practice, communism has "solved" the problem by killing off anybody who is _too_ productive, and who therefore raises embarrassing questions about why the rest of the group is a bunch of sluggards. The mass butchery of "kulaks" in the USSR is a good instance of this. A poor second best is to have a neighboring capitalist country to which people of politically incorrect skill and ambition flee. I often wonder just what Castro would have done if the Cubans presently in Miami would have been forced to remain in Cuba. Would they have revolted and killed him off, or been killed? Best of all is to build a wall locking the citizens of your country in, load it up so heavily with attack dogs, barbed wire, and land mines that most people fleeing over it die, and then give everyone the choice of obedience, prison, or flight. This would be a bad science-fiction novel, if the East Germans hadn't actually done it. The last person to die crossing the wall, as I recall, was an unarmed woman who was shot in the back. Erich Honecker was going to go on trial for that, but he fled to socialists in Chile. It's good to be kind to one's intellectual opponents, but sometimes it's a sheer waste of time.

I have also had an appellate court uphold such action and hide behind California Rules of Court, Rule 106 ("The judges of the appellate department shall not be required to write opinions in any cases decided by them, but may do so whenever they deem it advisable or in the public interest."). That is reality, I agree.

talk.politics.misc	 Why all the quote marks, Roy? I can see that they might be appropriate where there is a legitimate concern that the words are being distorted by context, or that they have been appropriated Newspeak-style, but, reading your comments above, one might be excused if they assumed that you were claiming that "child abuse", "forced" sexual activity, and "damage" caused by this is non-existant or greatly overblown. 
talk.politics.misc	 Hmmm. Human gestation period is something like 39 weeks. That means third trimester abortions are those done after 26 weeks. In consulting a 1989 World Almanac, I see that 1% of abortions in 1983 were done at 21 weeks or more. That's about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks. Unless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically, or a LOT of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks, I think you are wrong.

talk.politics.misc	 Yes, sadly, this is true. The primary reason, and the essence of the details that you are seeking, is that the Grahm-Rudman budget controls were working. In fact, they were working so well that unless the feds did something, they were going to have to start cutting pork. So Bush and the Democrats got together in a Budget Summit and replaced Grahm-Rudman with the now historic Grand Compromise in which Bush "consented" to raise taxes in exchange for certain caps on spending increases.

talk.politics.misc	 Your statement is a common misconception, but it just isn't true. In the German Weimar system, the Chancellor was not necessarily the leader of the largest Reichstag party; the Chancellor was appointed by the President and generally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effective majority in the Reichstag. Beyond that, the implication that Hitler rose to the Chancellorship because a majority of Germans wanted Nazi rule is false as well. Before President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor in January 1933, the German people did not show a particular desire to be led either by Hitler or by the Nazi party. These are the results of the March 1932 election for President, the closest Hitler ever came to direct election: Hindenburg 49.6%, Hitler 30.1%, Thaelmann 13.2%, Duesterberg 6.8%. In the runoff election in April the results were: Hindenburg 53%, Hitler 36.8%, Thaelmann 10.2%. So we can see that Hitler personally was supported by only about a third of German voters.

talk.politics.misc	 The economic and political ignorance of most Americans can be truly scary. Price controls and government intervention. The surest route to disaster. It's amazing, people never seem to learn from history (or common sense). Price controls do not, and cannot work. I would have thought our last experiment in the 70's would have been enough to dampen the belief that price controls can actually work. As for government intervention, people never seem to get the irony of what the are saying. We are told that entitlements are the biggest portion of the budget and they must be 'controlled'. We are presented with horror stories of waste and fraud in almost all government agencies. We are shown stories about the miserable treatment our veterans get in our government run hospitals. We are just now seeing stories about how Social Security isn't going to cut it in the future (as if that should come as any surprise). And yet, people choose to ignore all of that and believe in the fairy tale of the government coming to the rescue. Simply amazing.

I simply stated that they can pass all the laws they want but not a single one of them will make you or I more moral people. They may make us act in a moral manner, but our actions are only a reflection of the unwillingness to risk punishment. They say nothing about whether we have become more moral or not. Perhaps the distinction is too fine.

talk.politics.misc	 Wrong, if a bunch of faggots from the tenderloin decide to go straight bashing and they selectively target a heterosexual man and beat the bloody fuck out of him, they would get charged as well under all the federal laws that exist about violation of civils rights. The focus of their intent is his sexual orientation, and so the law applies to them as well. The national government retains the right to make any laws necessary to sufficiently deter and punish any crime against someone's civil rights until that behavior becomes so well punished that nobody even tries it! The fact is, that at last count, gays were not beating straights for their sexual orientation. Thus, the law is getting applied only to the straights who indulge themselves. The federal government or judiciary has the right to enforce the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under law even if it takes 1000 possible charges against people who would violate them. Go read your constitutional law. We broke the back of the KKK's harrassment campaign with the same strategy in the early 1900's. So many went to jail and for so long that it cut the heart out of the KKK. -RSW 
talk.politics.misc	 The federal government has used such laws to allow mutliple charges in order to prevent more crimes than would nromally occur just from two people being pissed off at each other. The federal government has an interest in the intent of the perpetrators in the pursuit of preventing violations of civil rights. It's the way they broke the back of the Klan, by putting a lot of people away for a very long time for harrassing blacks specifically. It is a principle that has been well recognized as constitutionally valid since over 100 years ago. It has been used whenever a select group was getting bashed or harrassed more than any other person would just for being part of a minority. It is the only way we made the defeat of the south stick after the Civil War. People who harrassed free blacks, when normally they wouldn't find themselves harrassing just anyone walking around were expeditiously tried and jailed for 5 to 8 years until nobody wanted to try it anymore. Now with the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law, the law can use multiple crime and severe penalty involving intent as much as is needed to protect even one human that is a hated minority to somebody. They can call out the national guard just for them, as they did the school girls in Alabama during desegregation in the 1950's, and the president can nationalize the state militia and turn the guns of the militia that were being used to bar blacks right around to point at the thousands in the crowd with an order to shoot that they would have to obey or face possible death by firing squad under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for failing to obey a direct order while under arms! And by god, they did! Those southern boys turned right around an fixed bayonets! And the governor was left standing and was arrested by the federal marshalls that had brought the order to nationalize the guard. And that's why we need such an ability in federal jurisdiction. -RSW

Luckily for us, some of our politicians with vision passed some environmental laws. That isn't to say that they shouldn't be modified, but all I ever hear from you is that the environmental laws were dreamed up by a bunch of left-wing tree-huggers intent on putting us back on horseback.

Let me just say that I think your action of cross posting this was total BS, and you're trying to start some crap. Hopefully, others will see through your trite little game and not play along. 
talk.politics.misc	 Alan, you can start by teaching your children that the perpetrators of crimes no more represent the "Black community" than racist hateful Whites represent the majority culture (although there are many ethnic minorities who have fallen into the very trap that you are struggling with, and believe otherwise). The trap is the easy way out. For yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that the demographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race, and much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You're going to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic group or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors leading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually than not, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement. If, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few Blacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you'd see the crime statistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you then worry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable or whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to define "us" and "other" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerous when we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational humans. It's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the *most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don't know the racial makeup of Phoenix, so I can't speak to your situation. However, I live in San Francisco, a city that loves to tout its "ethnic diversity". Here, we have Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the "model minority") gangs, and even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularly troublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to their propensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people on the street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs and crime are what they most fear. During the "disturbance" in Los Angeles last year many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! I remember being amazed at television news scenes that showed looting mobs where there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleaned from TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives that live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country's first truly multi-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion that in the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black* riot! In closing, I'd like to say that you raise some interesting points that really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring the racism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. As a people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problem becomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I truly believe that the well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our current course of denial and repression. I wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors, luck in avoiding the "trap". Peace, my brother. m.

talk.politics.misc	 Civil Rights. Civil Rights are issued by the State with whatever strings attached they choose as the Grantor of said rights. And if that means that verdicts are determined by the needs of the state rather than by guilt or innocence in a traditional sense, so be it. Being subjective rather than objective may make it harder to anticipate what is right, and you may be sacrificed for being wrong inadvertantly once in a while, but that really is a small price to pay for the common good don't you think?

Unlike the propaganda spouted by the far right the ten percent figure was backed up by the best study available at the time. Its hardly certain that this new study is correct since it hasn't even been out for enough time for any double checking to happen. 
talk.politics.misc	 Of course, one again faces the question of how one circumscribes government power (and keeps it circumscribed) in a complex society when it is in the interest of neither capitalists nor consumers to refrain from using government power for their own ends. But apart from that little conundrum... 
talk.politics.misc	 I'm not sure why you don't consider it an option. No one suggests that such analysis should be left to "regulators." In fact, the "re-inventing government" movement provides just such a cost/benefit approach to the analysis of public spending. Libertarians would do well to learn more about it.

talk.politics.misc	 Without having a complete answer to this question, I should think it obvious that the first step should be to convince people this would be a desirable result. There are still quite a lot of people who feel that the command economies of eastern Europe failed due to corruption rather than essential weaknesses of caommand economies, and you still have a majority in this nation that favors keeping unenforced and unenforcible laws on the books in order to "send a signal".

talk.politics.misc	 Well, the fact of the matter is that poverty is imperfectly related to social and political instability, while economic inequality is much more strongly related. In virtually all major revolutions including England (the Puritan revolution), France, Russia and China, the revolutions occurred as economies were undergoing substantial long term growth and poverty was declining. What sets off revolutions is massive inequality coupled with a perception on the part of those at the bottom that social change is possible. 
talk.politics.misc	 And the reason that the Soviet Union couldn't achieve the ideal of pure communism was the hostility of surrounding capitalist nations...Uh huh. Somehow, this all sounds familiar. Once again, utopian dreams are confronted by the real world... 
talk.politics.misc	 Since our doctors are private and the "system" is just an insurance plan, litigation would not involve the insurance fund. Our lawyers do not work on contingency, so that if you were to sue for malpractice then you'd better be sure of winning to cover your fees ... likewise, if you were a doctor and subject of a suit, it's time to sweat. 
talk.politics.misc	 This is a difficult problem for which there is no obviously good solution. One approach is simply to try and move political opinion and hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while. Another approach is to try and amend the constitution. The original constitution restrained the U.S. government from economic intervention for 100 to 150 years, depending on just how one wants to count it. The First Amendment, though weakened in many ways, still restrains government (particularly state and local), even though on many particular issues the majority is in favor of censorship. I think libertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint via an amendment or two (not that I think that's likely to happen).

talk.politics.misc	 OK Phil, you're right. So far the "evidence" suggests that Nixon was a victim of overzealous underlings and Kennedy was a womanizing disgust-o-blob with a dash of megalomania. After crushing the CIA and FBI who's to say Kennedy wouldn't have created his own version of American Friendly Fascism?

talk.politics.misc	 I am glad that you recognize that people should not engage in denial and repression, and should acknowledge such. The United States, with its people, have recognized that repression has taken place, with the loss and outright abrogation of civil liberties and constitutional protections of citizens. This recognition has taken the form of the civil rights law (let's just discuss the federal level for now), such as 18 USC 241 et. seq., 42 USC 1981 et. seq, et. al. With this recognition of repression, at times manifested in the form of collective guilt, I want people to recognize denial. Though it can be said that white people numerically commit more crimes in the United States, because white people are a majority, it can also be said that black people commit a disproportionate amount of crime in the United States, in their relation to their numbers in population. My views are out of experiences when I was a police officer in a large metropolitan area, and of a citizen. Unless people account for their behavior, and for the behavior of their immediate community, nothing will improve. 
talk.politics.misc	 No, it's a sign of aristocrtic out-of-touchness with the middle class. You ask George Herbert Walker Bush about that. 
talk.politics.misc	 Steve, you're the one who suggested that a failed government should be an ideal proving ground, I never felt that way in the first place. Quite the contrary, I think a better proving ground would be someplace that already had a governemnt that would prevent outright acts of agression, yet had a strong spirit of individualism and initiative. Someplace like... Texas :-) 
talk.politics.misc	 Well, I don't think your query was exactly polite, but I will TRY to give you a polite responce. Something atypical of the net, but here it goes. 
talk.politics.misc	 I did hear this question asked during a radio news update of the case. (They were talking about the ongoing trial and had some audio clips). Immediately after the defense attorney asked the question, there was an "Objection!" heard in the background. The clip ended at that point so I don't know if the objection was upheld. I can't imagine NC is *that* bad. 
talk.politics.misc	 Didn't the new study asked "have you engaged in homosexual intercourse within the last two years" whereas Kinsey asked "have you ever engaged or thought about engaging in homosexual activity".

If, as the surveys show, up to 33% of all men have *had* a homosexual encounter, then there must be an even *larger* percentage of people who have had homosexual erotic fantasies. But if less than 10% of the population is gay, what can we say about these people who don't identify as gay but have demonstrated gay potential. Obviously, a large chunk of these people *chose* (or, more accurately, were forced to choose by force of religion and social sanction) to put those feelings aside, to be heterosexual.

Would it really matter if it were millions of people who are regularly denied access to housing, employment, and personal security or even only one? As for death threats, I happen to know from personal experience that gay people are far more likely to receive them based on political veiws or even personal philosophies related to the issue of sexual orientation than are heterosex uals. Not a week goes by that I personally or one of my friends is not physically or verbally harrassed for even appearing to be gay. Everyone is garaunteed certain unalienable rights under our current form of government in theory, yet every day gay people are victimized by their local governments, by the police force, and by (for the most part) an uninformed and ignorant public. Is this democracy? I don't think so. A society's sense of justice is judged on the basis of the treatment of the people who make up that society. All of those people. And yes, that includes gays, lesbians, and bisexuals whose "crimes" have no victims, and who are as varied and diverse as the society of wich they are a part.

BUT government should supply those necessary goods and services only when it is impossible for a private enterprise (or individual) to make money from providing them. I agree with some of the other posts that this train probably can not make money and will rely heavily on State tax dollars. 
talk.politics.misc	 Either the government has force available to it, or it doesn't. The Libertarian position is that the government can use force only when someone else uses force first -- even when that first force is not directed against the government, but one of its citizens.

talk.politics.misc	 I would doubt any civil rights case would be in order for the point that you mentioned. Even if it were possible, I think it is a bad idea since it smacks real strongly of double jeopardy. A civil case for damages is fine since that is a trial that would proceed regardless of the first. I think a bad precedent has already been set in the King trial in L.A. and something like this would make it worse. Regardless of how bad anybody feels about this decision, it must stand that charges of assault were not not proven against the three marines and that's how it should stand.

Consider that both the U.S. and Great Britain have domestic sources to partly satisfy their energy needs. Pricy OPEC oil impacts both Germany, Japan and many other "industrial rivals" more than these two. In addition, the proceeds from the sale (especially by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait U.A.E. etc) are disproportionately reinvested in the U.S. and G.B., propping up these economies and further providing an incentive to keep prices from falling too low.

talk.politics.misc	 Such as? Not being able to get married isn't a roadblock to a permanent relationship. Lack of a marriage certificate doesn't force a couple to break up. This is an excuse used by homosexuals because the alternative is to ask why they are so much more promiscuous than straights.

talk.politics.misc	 I'm sorry about your friend. Really. But this anecdote does nothing to justify the "war on drugs". If anything, it demonstrates that the "war" is a miserable failure. What it demonstrates is that people will take drugs if they want to, legal or not. Perhaps if your friend were taking legal, regulated drugs under a doctors supervision he might not be in the position he's in now. 
talk.politics.misc	 Isn't is funny how someone who seems to know nothing about homosexuality uses a very flawed (IMHO) source of information to pass jusgement on all homosexual and bisexual men. It would seem more logical to say that since the heterosexual group of men is larger then the chances of promiscuity larger as well. In my opinion, orientation has nothing to do with it.

This is a dangerous attitude indeed. Because it's not a very big step from "people are sheep, they can't think for themselves" to "people are sheep and need firm leadership from we, who know better"... this sort of attitude makes me worry about what'll happen to the United States if the extremist wing of the Republican party ever gets back into power again.

Danforth Quayle as an insult is sauce for William Jefferson Blythe Clinton. Do you feel that calling a President by his full name implies some sort of disrespect? Hint: this is a rhetorical question. 
talk.politics.misc	 I don't understand what you are getting at here. If the chances of promiscuity are larger, yet the rate of promiscuity is lower in the heterosexual community, doesn't that imply that the homo/bi sexual population is then even more promiscuous than the raw statistics imply? (No axe to grind here I'm just a scientist and I hate to see statistics abused.)

They ran down how a percent tax was added at each stage of manufacturing, graphicaly depicting a stack of quarters being added at each wholesale stage. When they got to the final stage (the actual retail sale) the small stack of quarters added to the large stack already there was said to be "the amount paid by consumers." In other words, they completed ignored the fact that at each stage the tax would of course be passed on to the next buyer with the retail consumer paying the full load.

As for C-17 vs. C-5 , the C-17 can't carry as much but has more capability ( read : can land at smaller airfields of which there are more of ) than the C-5. Now is the C-17 pork? It depends on whether your job relies on it or not. :) In California right now, I would say that it is not pork since due to peace dividend so many people are out of work.

talk.politics.misc	 The test isn't whether GM knew--otherwise that would reward GM for its stupidity. The test is whether GM reasonably should have known of their existence. It works both ways--if GM had won the trial, and the plaintiff turned up two witnesses who came forward after the first trial who should have been located beforehand, too bad, so sad--no new trial. 
talk.politics.misc	 And not only that, but if the drugs were legal we could have pharmacists instead of pushers selling them, and the pharmacists could be obligated to not only inform the purchasers of the dangers of drug use, but also show them how to use the drugs in relatively safe ways.

talk.politics.misc	 One of the commentators on one of the Big Three news programs described the VAT (which ain't a sales tax) as a tax "government's love." I was even surprised he got the reason right: it effectively hides the majority of the tax the consumer has to pay *from* the consumer. It's kind of like they do with cars. You pay far more for automobile taxes than most people realize because it's contained in two dozen different taxes, everything from your license to your tires to your gasoline. 
talk.politics.misc	 Actually, what the study shows is that 2 percent of the men surveyed *said* they engaged in homosexual sex and 1 percent *said* they considered themselves exclusively homosexual.

talk.politics.misc	 Unfortunately, there's not much we can learn from the statistics presented here either. Due to rounding, the 1991 est. for LSD could be anywhere from .550 to .649 and the 1992 est. could be anywhere from .850 to .949. This means that the actual change (if you believe these statistics in the first place) was anywhere from 31% to 73%. Similarly the increase in cocaine use could be anywhere from 18% to 66% and the increase of crack use could be anywhere from 29% to 120%. This doesn't even take into account the margin of error which isn't provided here.

During times when drugs were legalized, those trends were reversed.

That knowledge was sent East to India and China when Abraham gave "gifts" (the commentators to Jewish scripture say this was the knowledge of the occult arts) to all the rest of his children when he sent them away to the East. This assured that Isaac only, who remained with Abraham, would inherit his most important spiritual gifts, what eventually became Judaism.

However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between YHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral Code to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries fall, though.

talk.religion.misc	 The Roman Catholic conservatives are coming out in the open to line up with Pat Robertson and his ultra Right Wing Christian Coalition. Former Secretary of Education William Bennet, a Roman Catholic, stood beside the Christian Coalition's spokesman Ralph Reed at a March 3 conference in Washington. The purpose of the conference was to publish results of a Christian Coalition poll which was designed to prove that the Republican party would lose major support if it backed away from the "Family Values" positons of the '92 convention.

(6) Both of the choices you give Stephen assume that he condoned taking quotes out of context in A. (7) I assumed you were being logical, and that the sentence that begins "Could you please explain ..." was not a nonsequitur, but was intended to follow from the sentence that preceded it. (8) Therefore, I concluded that you believed that (2) implied that Stephen condoned taking quotes out of context in A (9) But we've already seen that (2) does not imply this (10) Therefore, you were incorrect to believe that (2) implied that Stephen thought it was okay to take quotes out of context in A, and were making an error of a kind that is frequently made by creationists. 
talk.religion.misc	 I'm curious about this statement, is it a known understanding amongst Christian believers that people who don't understand the Christian doctrines are enjoying this state? I come from a background with a heavy Christian teaching (Lutheran church), and consider myself knowledgeable with the basic understandings of Christianity. At the same time I'm *not* proud of things I don't understand or know of at this point of time. Ignorance is not bliss! 
talk.religion.misc	 My online Bible is on a CD, but I don't own a CD-ROM system for the time being, so I can't search for the famous cite where Jesus explicitly states that he didn't want to break existing (Jewish) laws.

talk.religion.misc	 The same way that any theory is proven false. You examine the predicitions that the theory makes, and try to observe them. If you don't, or if you observe things that the theory predicts wouldn't happen, then you have some evidence against the theory. If the theory can't be modified to incorporate the new observations, then you say that it is false. 
talk.religion.misc	 Superficially a good answer, but it isn't that simple. An awful lot of the starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic policies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical Westerner. For instance, some third-world countries with terrible malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can be fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers. They have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans we encouraged them to take out. Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre idea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got. 
talk.religion.misc	 Well, there are two approaches we can take here. One is to ask you what this objective morality is, assuming it's not a secret.

That there are two conflicting versions of this objective morality does tell us something about (a). It tells us at least one fake objective morality exists.

talk.religion.misc	 I recently read an article in a local paper written by an Islamic person who was upset with the way Islam has been portrayed by western media. When a terrorist action takes place in the middle east, it is always played up as an Islamic Terrorist. However, when the a Serbian terrorist attacks the Croations, its not a Christian terrorist, its just a terrorist. I have often tried to explain this to some close friends who believe the press, that Islam is somehow tied to violence. Often times you hear things like "They just don't value human life like we do..." and so on. I was wondering if anyone out there had any suggestions for how we can change this image, or how I can help my friends to see that this is just hype. I would appreciate any serious suggestions or comments via e-mail, and I'm not interested in hearing about how right the press is.

talk.religion.misc	 The observation that the Tree of Life would rotate clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern probably doesn't give enough consideration to the feebleness of the Coriolis force compared to, say, the phototropism of vegetation. A much more likely explanation is the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because the sun progresses across the sky that way. (Although that's not the historical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation images of the sun moving thru the heavens. So it's more valid to talk of the clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me? Of course not.) Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the anti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or because it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel. The use of anti-Sun to represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented, but I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now. -- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com) 
talk.religion.misc	 The trouble with trying to find out the truth is that Roehm and his buddies were ACCUSED OF being flaming faggots, one of the pretexts for the Night of Long Knives in which Roehm and most of the SA wing of the NSDAP were purged. Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records, anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered tainted evidence. The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd, the SA -- Sturmabteilung, "Storm Troopers" -- left the world a better place when they departed, but concrete particulars are still no more than more or less shrewd guesses. -- Diccon Frankborn

By biblical scholar I mean an expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the chips fall where they may.

talk.religion.misc	 Absolutely. Lewis didn't care for the 1921 O.T.O. charter from Reuss. He had in mind something completely diferent. Crowley and Lewis were very different persons, as you probably know. 
talk.religion.misc	 ON the subject of how many competing RC orders there are, let me point out the Golden Dawn is only the *outer* order of that tradition. The inner order is the Roseae Rubeae et Aurae Crucis. That's Ruby Rose and Gold Cross, in rough translation. The G.'.D.'. is a Rosicrucian order, as are all derivative groups. Of course, real Rosicrucians never admit to being Rosicrucian. 
talk.religion.misc	 Just wondering, do you mean the "Lectorium Rosicrucianum"? Warning: There is no point in arguing who's "legit" and who's not. *WHICH* Golden Dawn are you talking about? 
talk.religion.misc	 The following is an introduction as to who is Muhammad SAW as will be covered with this treatise. 
talk.religion.misc	 I think this is a weak argument. The fact is, there are *two* references to Jesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least been altered by Christians. Origen wrote, in the third century, that Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage says the opposite. There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the Jews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho for Jesus and may be authentic. There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference to Jesus in Josephus. There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which lack the references. 
talk.religion.misc	 No, I don't mean the LR, whatever that is. As for which GD, I'm using _The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic_ as my source, so (unless Regardie is lying) I'm pulling the name out the the original order's rituals. The multiple modern groups are part of why I through in the comment about all the "spin-offs". 
talk.religion.misc	 The first means that some aspect of reality contains objective values. The second means that values are a reference to some preference of the individual. In the first case, it is possible that some future discovery might invalidate certain views re what objective values are. 
talk.religion.misc	 Stop! Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that the first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi party, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red herring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of the histories I've read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using homosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that Hitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse official history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts right. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in a coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of homosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it is possible that the histories I've read have not mentioned this, but I doubt it - would it be in Hitler's best interest to admit to the world that his former right hand man was a homosexual?). 
talk.religion.misc	 Yes, this is certainly one of the traditional ideas about the Mithraic cult (although not the only one.) It had many elements that seem to have been borrowed by Catholicism (e.g. the Mass, communion, the sharing of a sacred meal, consecration of bread and wine, etc.)

talk.religion.misc	 These laws written for the Israelites, God's chosen people whom God had expressly set apart from the rest of the world. The Israelites were a direct witness to God's existence. To disobey God after KNOWing that God is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately punishable. Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to God's chosen people. But Jesus has changed all of that. We are living in the age of grace. Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death. There is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. And not just for a few chosen people. Salvation is available to everyone, Jew and Gentile alike.

talk.religion.misc	 I understand and sympathize with your pain. What happened in Waco was a very sad tradgedy. Don't take it out on us Christians though. The Branch Davidians were not an organized religion. They were a cult led by a ego-maniac cult leader.

Love your neighbour as yourself. Love your enemies. Is Jesus Christ their Lord and Saviour? By the persecution of Jews, they are violating all the precepts of what Christ died for. They are in direct violation of the teachings of Christ. Even Jesus who was crucified by the Jewish leaders of that time, loved His enemies by asking the Father for forgiveness of their sins. I am a Christian and I bear no animosity towards Jews or any one else. The enemy is Satan, not our fellow man.

talk.religion.misc	 God being unknowable, I can't comment on His motives, but it would be distressing if He allowed us to misunderstand Him through no fault of our own. For sanity's sake we must assume, if we believe in Him at all, that His message comes through somehow. The question is whether it comes through immediately to every individual, or is contained in a complex canon that must be interpreted by experts in consultation with one another, or is transmitted directly through appointed representatives who are free to interpret, extend and modify the canon. If God's message is indeed mediated, the further problem arises as to whether the individual under- stands the mediated message fully and clearly. Since the responsibility for understanding lies ultimately with the individual, we must assume that God in His benevolence guides each individual to the appropriate source for that individual, whereof the person may or may not drink.

talk.religion.misc	 IMO, a Christian has no need of weapons. I know it is very contrary to the American NRA ethos of the right to bear arms, but Christians should rely on the strength of God to protect them. Note that I say *should*. We are inherently insecure but I feel that that is not proper justification to be armed to the teeth. A Christian should not have to rely on physical weapons to defend himself. A Christian should rely on his faith and intelligence. For instance, I have the faith that God will protect me but God also gave me the intelligence to know not to go walking down that dark alley at night. To jump off a cliff and say that God will save me would be putting God to the test. And who are we to test God?

talk.religion.misc	 For those missing the context of this thrilling discussion between Jim and I, Jim wrote the following to me in e-mail after I pointed out that he (Jim) had taken a quote out of context: In t.r.m. Robert Weiss writes [a promise from Psalm 9:10] Gee, since you wouldn't be at all hypocritical, you must be really busy arguing against these out-of-context extracted translations! 
talk.religion.misc	 I addressed most of the key issues in this very long (284 lines) post by Dean Kaflowitz in two posts yesterday. The first was made into the title post of a new thread, "Is Dean Kaflowitz terminally irony-impaired?" and the second, more serious one appeared along the thread 
talk.religion.misc	 Most of the key issues in the 284 line post to which I am following up are dealt with in the following post I made on talk.abortion yesterday, modified to correct the next to last paragraph. 
talk.religion.misc	 Very well put. And, in the case of someone who calls himself a Christian brother yet continues in his sin (and claims that his sin is not a sin at all, but perfectly acceptable), what should be done? Should Christians just ignore a sinful lifestyle in order to not offend the person? By reaffirming that the lifestyle is sinful according to the Bible, are they using "a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus"? 
talk.religion.misc	 huh? it might be interesting. he is relating the story as I have heard it, btw. 
talk.religion.misc	 I would really appreciate if when someone brought something like this up they didn't back out when someone asked for details. 
talk.religion.misc	 Nor, to point out the obvious, are the deluded, siege-mentality followers of a religious nut-case who thought he was Jesus Christ or possibly The Big Guy. Personally, much as I regard the BATF and FBI as ConDupes, I'll take their word over a bunch of silly pinks who were stoopid enough to lock themselves up with a goofball like "David Koresh" in a makeshift arsenal. 
talk.religion.misc	 There were some recent developments in the dispute about Masonry among Southern Baptists. I posted a summary over in bit.listserv.christia, and I suppose that it might be useful here. Note that I do not necessarily agree or disagree with any of what follows: I present it as information. 
talk.religion.misc	 Why are you running away from the word of Jesus? Has somebody superseded the word of Jesus? If you don't follow the morality of the Ten Commandments and the Law and the Prophets and the word of Jesus, whose morality do you follow? 
talk.religion.misc	 It's amazing how everyone automatically blames one side or the other. One thing for sure: Koresh will have no chance to defend himself against the statements (lacking in fact or COurt sponsored verification) made by agents who participated in the situation that killed him. 
talk.religion.misc	 Jehovah's Witnesses do not believe that Christians are required to observe the Sabbath, whether it is on Saturday or Sunday. The Sabbath was part of a Covenent between God and the Israelites and is not required for Christians. 
talk.religion.misc	 Sorry, but it doesn't matter what _you_ think, I am a Christian, who happens to belong to the LDS Church. [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]. 
talk.religion.misc	 If I have a habit that I really want to break, and I am willing to make whatever sacrifice I need to make to break it, then I do so. There have been bad habits of mine that I've decided to put forth the effort to break, and I've done so; there have been other bad habits that I've decided are not worth the effort to break. It's my choice, either way. 
talk.religion.misc	 What are the consequences of the homophobic ranting of the self-righteous? Well, I just noted this on another group, and thought I'd pass it along. The context is talk.origins, and a report of yet another "debate" that was nothing but an attempt at mindless bullying and factless assertion by a standard-issue Creationist. The writer reflects that the behavior reported reminds him of some Christian groups he has known. I believe that the writer is a (non-homosexual) Christian: 
talk.religion.misc	 And he went out to meet Asa, And said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, And all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you. 
talk.religion.misc	 Kermit Tensmeyer quoted from a few sources and then wrote something. I will attempt to construct a facsimile of what was previously said, and then address Kermit's offering. 
talk.religion.misc	 Well, if they were Satanists, or followers of an obscure religion, then I would be sure that Christians would in unison condemn and make this to a show case. But when we are dealing with a fanatical Revelation preacher that kills ultimately everyone, including the innocent children, then it seems that we are dealing with Christians and christians (note the spelling). 
talk.religion.misc	 Well, looking at the videos it seems that this fire started in various places at the same time, which would indicate that this was a planned action. I'm sure FBI and BATF didn't *deliberately* start a possible fire, having a sniper kill Korresh would have been a far easier method. Looking at the careful operation, and use of tear gas that as I know don't start fires, it is less likely that this was the case. 
talk.religion.misc	 There's another point to be made. Those who have been inside burning houses know that if they want to stay alive, it's better to run out from the building. We had one case where an FBI agent *had to drag out a women* from the burning house, she run back in when she saw the forces arriving. It is a good indication of the fanatical mind that the followers had -- including having they children burned instead of saving these innocent victims of the instance. 
talk.religion.misc	 The interesting notion is that (I watched TV tonight) Koresh never claimed officially to be Jesus Christ. His believers hoped that he would be, but he never took this standpoint himself. 
talk.religion.misc	 Christians through ages have had to learn to be patient. I do think it's time to face the reality. The events during the last 52 two days showed what the world is really like. 
talk.religion.misc	 If anyone is interested in the history of AMORC, I do think Spencer Lewis published books about the beginning and his mission. The Alexandria bookstore (that's the name of the book store operated by AMORC) should have a selection that should provide the interested reader more insight). 
talk.religion.misc	 Hence we are "all" above the Law where "all" in this case refers to Christians. 
talk.religion.misc	 There is a rite like this described in Joseph Campbell's _Occidental_Mythology_. He also described levels of initiation, I think 6? I don't know where Campbell got his info, but I remember thinking he was being a little eclectic. 
talk.religion.misc	 So we have this highly Christian religious order that put fire on their house, killing most of the people inside. 
talk.religion.misc	 Jesus certainly demonstrated the great depth of his love for the children who died today at the Davidian complex. 
talk.religion.misc	 Do you question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III, Nero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes? Their documents have decayed to dust too. Brian, why another excuse? 
talk.religion.misc	 I share Dennis's outrage over a similar manner. I have recently become aware that my health insurance includes coverage for illness and injuries suffered by Christians. It disturbs me deeply to know that my premiums may be used to pay for that which I sincerely believe is divine punishment for their sinful conduct. In addition these folks are able to avail themselves of such alternative therapies as Lourdes, Fatima, Morris Cerullo, Benny Hinn, etc. In any case as "Jesus Saves' I feel that there is no reason for them to be covering their bets at my expense. I would like to request that I be exempted from Christian coverage with my health premiums reduced accordingly. 
talk.religion.misc	 John 12:24-26: "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls onto the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain. "He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. "If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also. If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor." 
talk.religion.misc	 I responded to Jim's other articles today, but I see that I neglected to respond to this one. I wouldn't want him to think me a hypocrite for not responding to *every* stupid article on t.r.m. 
talk.religion.misc	 Please! I'm begging you! Quit confusing religious groups, and stop making generalizations! I'm a Protestant! I'm an evangelical! I don't believe that my way is the only way! I'm not a "creation scientist"! I don't think that homosexuals should be hung by their toenails! 
talk.religion.misc	 First off, let me congratulate you for not posting a flame about "You sick perverts, you are immoral, you are all going to hell.", which seems to be the usual "religious" post found on the alt.sex.* hierarchy. Hopefully, you won't get flamed, either. 
talk.religion.misc	 A lot of people won't agree with me. That's their right and I respect that. However, to the point, Jews are also covered by the saving grace of Jesus Christ. There are Jews who have become Christians. 
talk.religion.misc	 Hate to shatter your self image of perfection that you appear to hold, but your language is wrong: Jim and me. 
talk.religion.misc	 The two commandments *are* rules; they are merely rules that are so vague that they are practically devoid of meaning. Michael Siemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution of an argument over them turns on secular and cultural assumptions that are independent of these rules. 
talk.religion.misc	 Yeah. Innocents. People who hoard $250K worth of high-caliber automatic weapons and kill law-enforcement agents really fit the bill here. The only innocents were the 20+ children who were prevented from leaving a burning building by their self-appointed messiah-following parents. A burning STARTED by the Davidians. 
talk.religion.misc	 im glad i finally have heard exactly what the OTO is all about. i finally know that i can stop looking, content i the knowlege that im not interested. it's tough enough listening to all the religions who refer to themselves as "the One Truth". How can i possibly accept it from a magical order? "We have all the Answers and will give them to those who join us (and pay dues)?" Scary. Besides, answers are easy. Questions! now that's another story... 
talk.religion.misc	 Robert, you keep making references to "orthodox" belief, and saying things like "it is held that..." (cf. "Kermit" thread). On what exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call "orthodox?" Who is that "holds that" Luke meant what you said he meant? Whenever your personal interpretation of Biblical passages is challenged, your only response seems to be that one needs merely to "look at the Bible" in order to see the truth, but what of those who see Biblical things differently from you? Are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really understands it? Just curious, 
talk.religion.misc	 I suppose these illegal guns have been found? I suppose he was going to kill a bunch of people with them? --Ray Cote 
talk.religion.misc	 It is true that Mormons believe that all spirits (including Jesus, Lucifer, Robert Weiss) are in the same family. It does not mean that Jesus was created, but rather that Lucifer and Robert Weiss were not. I agree that this is a "heresy". So what? The sweating of blood in Gethsemene is not a basic Mormon doctrine. Jesus did not perform the atonement in Getheseme alone, as some anti-Mormons are trying to teach. As far as the "unpardonable sin" whatever that is, it is Biblical, and not specifically Mormon. It is also called the sin against the Holy Ghost. Most Bible scholars (other than conservative ones) do not believe Jehovah and Elohim were always the same. I'm sure you've heard of the J and the E texts? I don't know what you mean by "That He needed to be saved". Jesus? Jehovah? Elohim? In Mormon doctrine, Jesus was sinless, and thus did not "need to be saved". 
talk.religion.misc	 I will clarify my earlier quote. God's laws were originally written for the Israelites. Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to all people, not just the Jews. Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of Heaven through the saving grace of God. I never said that the Law was made obsolete by Jesus. 
talk.religion.misc	 Whatever the faults the FBI had, the fact is that responsibility for those deaths lies with Koresh. 
talk.religion.misc	 And does it not say in scripture that no man knows the hour of His coming, not even the angels in Heaven but only the Father Himself? DK was trying to play God by breaking the seals himself. DK killed himself and as many of his followers as he could. BTW, God did save the children. They are in Heaven, a far better place. How do I know? By faith. 
talk.religion.misc	 Just to remark that I have heard that David Koresh has risen from the dead. I dont know if it is true or not, but this is what I have been told. What do you guys think? 
talk.religion.misc	 You could argue that if you wanted, but I think a more reasonable argument would point out the fact that the remembrance feast was very similar to the Pesach (Passover) meal during Seder, a very Jewish ritual. 
talk.religion.misc	 Deuteronmy 20:13 And when the Lord thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword 
talk.religion.misc	 sm[?]a real Christian unless you're born again is a very fundamental biblical sm[?]conversion and regeneration are 'probably' part of some small USA-based cult 
talk.religion.misc	 There are actually a few important things we can glean from this mess: 1)tWhen they start getting desperate for an answer to the question: "What's it all about. Mr. Natural?", pinkboys will buy darn near *anything*, which means: 2)tThere's still plenty of $$$$ to be made in the False Jesus business by enterprising SubGenii. Just remember that: 3)tOnce you've separated the pinks from their green, don't blow it all on automatic weapons from Mexico. Put it in a Swiss bank account. Smile a lot. Have your flunkies hand out flowers in airports. The Con will just shrug you off as long as: 4)tYou never, never, NEVER start to believe your own bulldada! If "David Koresh" hand't started swallowing his own "apocalypso now" crap, he'd be working crossword puzzles in the Bahamas today instead of contributing to the mulch layer in Waco. This is because: 5)tWhen you start shooting at cops, they're likely to shoot back. And most of 'em are better shots than you are. 
talk.religion.misc	 Nut or not, he was clearly a liar. He said he would surrender after local radio stations broadcast his message, but he didn't. Then he said he would surrender after Passover, but he didn't. 
talk.religion.misc	 Please do! And if you don't want to post it here, email to me :-) I don't know how this discussion is appreciated here. I hate 'invading' newsgroups with themes of limited interest :-) 
talk.religion.misc	 Like most religions, the doctrine has good and bad in it. I would certainly reject the current implementations of the doctrine. 
talk.religion.misc	 The person who was telling me about the Septuagint version said that the Greeks had a wonderful library in Alexandria that was full of manuscripts/scrolls and that it was burned soon after the Septuagint version was translated (perhaps to conceal some changes in the different versions, or perhaps just as part of the typical burning of valuable things that occurs during changes in power groups, he/I dunno). 
talk.religion.misc	 As many people have mentioned, there is no reason why insurers could not offer a contract without abortion services for a different premium. The problem is that there is no guarantee that this premium would be lower for those who chose this type of contract. Although you are removing one service, that may have feedbacks into other types of covered care which results in a net increase in actuarial costs. 
talk.religion.misc	 Where does it say in the bible that Christians are supposed to persecute Jews? Isn't it love your enemies instead? They may say they are "Christian" but do their actions speak differently? Do you believe what everyone tells you? I don't. I came to believe in God by my own investigation and conclusions. And ultimately by my own choice. Salvation, however, was granted only through the grace of God. 
talk.religion.misc	 So, is this a real story or a work of fiction? How about some sources? When, where, and in what newspaper did you get all this from? Or is it all hypothetical? 
talk.religion.misc	 Bill, I find it rather remarkable that you managed to zero in on what is probably the weakest evidence. 
talk.religion.misc	 The problem is, your use of the word "objective" along with "values." Both definitions three and four are inherently subjective, that is they are particular to a given individual, or personal. You see, what one person may see as worthwhile, another may see as worthless. 
talk.religion.misc	 Slight semantical difference. The LDS Church does own a heck of a lot however. They are the largest land holder in MIssouri (where they think Christ will appear at the second coming). 
talk.religion.misc	 Brian K., I am pleased with your honesty. And to be honest as well, I believe you have not asked my god to come to you. Why do I say this? Because by the things you write on the net, and the manner with which you write them, you show me that you made up your own god and are attempting to pass him off as the real thing. I got news for you. Yours doesn't at all sound like mine. Your god doesn't come to you because your god doesn't exist. 
talk.religion.misc	 If given a definite definition of "God", it is sometimes possible to falsify the existance of that God. But, when one refuses to give an immutable definition, one can not. 
talk.religion.misc	 This is hardly possible, as the majority of people in the world were born, lived their life, and died, without ever knowing anything about Christ. The majority of the rest of the world have decided that he is not who Emery thinks he is. 
talk.religion.misc	 How incredibly fucking stupid. Of *course* the text is referring to the city itself (buildings, bricks, mortar, etc.) Otherwise it makes no sense to refer to the future of Tyre as being reduced to nothing but a _place_ to spread fishing nets. 
talk.religion.misc	 Of course it is. It forms a very big part of your self-respect. You come onto the board, thinking you're some sort of apologeticist for your faith, and you routinely get roasted over a grill for stupid theories and unfounded assumptions. 
talk.religion.misc	 Again, you missed Jesus's point. If you read the surrounding passages you would understand what Jesus means by "life in the world." But as is, you bumbled around, asserted your standard axiom that the Bible is bunk, and came up with the wrong idea. Also, you do not know exactly what Jesus means by eternal life. 
talk.religion.misc	 I understand that they had the neccessary licenses and permits to own automatic weapons. 
talk.religion.misc	 I haven't heard of ANY illegal guns being found. He was accused of not paying taxes on LEGAL guns.

talk.religion.misc	 I told some friends of mine two weeks ago that Koresh was dead. The FBI and the BATF could not let a man like that live. He was a testimonial to their stupidity and lies.

talk.religion.misc	 Women who are known not to want abortion services, for example, might be judged to be more likely to require prenatal care & coverage for childbirth... which can be an order of magnitude more expensive than abortion. 
talk.religion.misc	 Just for reference, here's the earlier quote: Malcolm Lee (mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca) wrote in reference to Leviticus 21:9 and Deuteronomy 22:20-25: : These laws written for the Israelites, God's chosen people whom God had : expressly set apart from the rest of the world. The Israelites were a : direct witness to God's existence. To disobey God after KNOWing that God : is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately : punishable. : Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to : God's chosen people. But Jesus has changed all of that. We are living in : the age of grace. Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death. There : is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. And : not just for a few chosen people. Salvation is available to everyone, Jew : and Gentile alike. 
talk.religion.misc	 Oh, bloody sorry old chap, why didn't you tell me you were a federale? Tough luck, eh? What's that? You say you're not dead yet? 
talk.religion.misc	 I would like to add my support for a misc.taoism discussion group. I applaud the enthusiam shown by the person posting <79899@cup.portal.com "Thyagi@cup.portal.com" (I read in alt.magick), but I differ with him/her in believing that at least some minimal parameters should be agreed upon. 
talk.religion.misc	 Surely you are not equating David Koresh with Christianity? The two are not comparable. 
talk.religion.misc	 Capser, before you deceive everone into thinking that the latter-day saints have undergone undue persecution through the years for just believing in their religion, perhaps you would like to tell us all what happened in the Mountain Meadow Massacres and all the killings that were done under the Blood Atonement Doctrine, at the command of Brigham Young? 
talk.religion.misc	 Contact: WATCHMAN FELLOWSHIP P.O. Box 171194 Holladay, UT 84117-1194 
talk.religion.misc	 As a matter of fact, yes I do or at least I strive to. I will not be so proud as to boast that my faith is 100%. I am still human and imperfect and therefore, liable to sin. Thankfully, there is opportunity for repentence and forgiveness. 
talk.religion.misc	 True, but that is exactly the "problem": the Mormon extermination order was issued not just by a Christian, it was ALLOWED under the Constitution of the United States, which was instituted precisely to prevent incidents like this "order" from occurring in the first place... As I indicated in an earlier posting, your "irrational hatred" is clearly evidenced by individuals like Robert Weiss (who could have been Gov. Boggs' Lieutenant; he would have fitted right in, drewling et al), and seems a modern-day occurrence, based on results (slander, persecution, misrepresentation, lies, denying Mormons representation in their own user group, etc. etc. 
talk.religion.misc	 By "they," you mean the leaders of the lds church? I grant you that when Joseph Smith was still alive, plenty of "accusations" were filed, most of which had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts. I have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see prove that the lds leadership was involved, in quote: "illegal activities." Plural marriage, yes, but your charge of "underage" wives sounds like it could have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral standards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it appears, those of David Koresh. 
talk.religion.misc	 Unfortunately, I think you've got it figured pretty well. I also ask myself the question "Why did they plan for so many months. Why was this so important to them? What was the government really up to? Why did they seal the warrant? Were they after Koresh or were they after the first and second amendments, among others? 
talk.religion.misc	 Well, dozens of children left the compound between the original BATF assualt and the FBI assault 7 weeks later. So if Koresh really wanted to kill children, why did he let so many go? 
talk.religion.misc	 No, and Im especially unhappy that these 70+ people died in an assault on private property with government armored vehicles. 
talk.religion.misc	 You are correct. See today's (4/21) Washington Post. The gas the FBI used is most certainly fatal in high concentrations. Of course, non-toxic tear gas is an oxymoron; the whole point of tear gas is that it is toxic, and its toxic effects cause people to seek fresh air. 
talk.religion.misc	 Now doesn't this sound a lot like the "colorful (or otherwise) story from antiquity that somehow tries to (or does) explain natural pheno- mena"? I think I hear what you're saying, but I'm not convinced that I know what you mean. The possibility exists that what _looks_ like "myth" on the surface may be after all much more than "just" a story. 
talk.religion.misc	 The three-legged symbol is a bit different, there is a word for them but I can't recall it, tri something, trieskalon?, don't know. These have more to do with the triple goddess in her three phases as reflected in females: girl-woman-crone.

See Robin Lane Fox's _The unauthorized version_, (p.284) where Lane Fox writes, "... the one passage which appears to [comment on Jesus' career] is agreed to be a Christian addition."

talk.religion.misc	 Only my common sense. The fire was caused by either Koresh and his followers or by the FBI/ATF/CIA/KGB/and maybe the Harper Valley PTA. Since you are throwing around the evidence arguement, I'll throw it back. Can you prove any government agency did it? (Please don't resort to "they covered it up so that proves they did it" or any wild theories about how the government agencies intentionally started the fire. The key words are proof and evidence.) proves they did it" 
talk.religion.misc	 Yes. I cannot remeber which works I read about this in, as it was many years ago. This ritual was called The Tarobaullum I believe, (The spelling may be off). 
talk.religion.misc	 Not to worry. The Masons have been demonized and harrassed by almost every major Xian church there is. For centuries now. And still they stand. They wil withstand the miserable Southern Boobtists, I am sure. They may even pick up a little support as people start to listen to the Boobtists and realize that subtracting the obvious lies and claims of Satanism that the Masons sound pretty good by comparison. One thing is known. A sizable proportion of Southern Babtists are Masons! And the Masons have already fired back in their own magazines against the Boobtist Witch-hunt. Since the Consrervatives have already been a divisive element with their war on Boobtist moderates and liberals, they may now start in on their Mason/Boobtist brothers and hasten their own downfall as more and more Southern Boobtists realize their church can't stand being run by a handful of clowns looking for holy civil wars and purity tests and drop 'em out of the leadership positions they have taken over. So as far as I am concerned, the louder, ruder, and more outrageous an Anti-Masonic Crusade these old goats mount, the better.

talk.religion.misc	 Atoms are not objective. They aren't even real. What scientists call an atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes certain physical, observable properties of our surroundings. All of which is subjective. 
talk.religion.misc	 Judging from postings I've read all over Usenet and on non-Usenet BBs conferences, Barney is DEFINITELY an endangered species. Especially if he runs into me in a dark alley. 
talk.religion.misc	 Does this organization have an official e-mail address these days? (an address for any of the SF Bay Area Lodges, e.g. Thelema would do.) 93... A.Lizard 
talk.religion.misc	 Let me begin by saying I think this is the world's first religion to use the net as its major recruitment medium. Therefore, even if this religion does not take off, its founding members will be very important historically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become common. 
talk.religion.misc	 Sorry, the San Jose based Rosicrucian order is called A.M.O.R.C, I don't remember for the time being what the A.M. stand for but O.R.C is Ordo Rosae Crucis, in other words latin for Order of the Rose Cross. Sigh, seems l'm loosing more and more of my long term memory. 
talk.religion.misc	 Be sure we pick on the "correct groups" here. "Bible thumpers", "fundamentalists", and Southern Baptists *deserve* our hasty generalizations and prejudicial statements. Just don't pick on the Presbyterians and the Methodists! [Sarcasm off] Please, prejudice is about thinking that all people of a group are the same, so please don't write off all Protestants or all evangelicals! 
talk.religion.misc	 Dennis, I'm astounded. I didn't know you were interested to even study such filth as alt.sex.stories provide...

talk.religion.misc	 I'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is interpreted and what significance it's given depends a great deal on the values of the observer. Science is a human activity and as such, is subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human activity. The myth that scientists are above moral influence or ethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure from nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense. 
talk.religion.misc	 Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you. 
talk.religion.misc	 Please, please don't make Barney to a modern martyr/saviour mythical figure. I detest this being, and if humans will create a religion in his name, then life will be unbearable :-). 
talk.religion.misc	 Jim, please, that's a lame explanation of the trinity that Jesus provides above. Baptizing people in the name of three things != trinity. If this is the case, then I'm wrong, I assumed that trinity implies that God is three entities, and yet the same. 
talk.religion.misc	 And I think we ought to hold Christ accoountable for all of his followers who died at the hand of the Romans also. It was their own fault for believing. 
talk.religion.misc	 I hope I didn't award custody, Rich. I purposely used "handle" in order to avoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there are aberrations like "scientific" creationism). I used "best" in part to indicate that science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains are mostly ignored. I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused the matter. As an aside, for science I should have written "how and when". Nobody seems to argue over what.
