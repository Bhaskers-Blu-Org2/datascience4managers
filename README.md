# Generalization, Utility, and Experimentation: ML Concepts for Making Better Business Decisions

This hands-on, self-service lab introduces fundamental concepts of machine learning (ML) as they apply to making data driven decisions.
Our goal is to empower decision makers to make more effective use of machine learning results and be better able to evaluate opportunities to apply ML in their industries.
You will get a brief overview of what it means to discover generalizable patterns in data, and learn basic principles of how to apply probabilistic results, including optimizing the business value of applying machine learning classifiers based on their sensitivity and specificity.
Finally, you will learn how ML and advanced analytics can help to guide (but not replace) the process of experimentally testing the effects of incremental changes to products and processes.

This is a non-programming workshop for business leaders and other people involved in managing products and making decisions based on data. The hands-on exercises require a web browser and Microsoft Excel.

This contents is available in the repository [datascience4managers](https://github.com/microsoft/datascience4managers).

## Contents

[Part 1](Part_1) - Learn how machine learning (ML) differs from traditional software engineering

[Part 2](Part_2) - See how ML fits in the context of making better business decisions

[Part 3](Part_3) - Understand why causal relationships matter in data analysis, and why we still need to do experiments

|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `src`             | Sample source code.                        |
| `.gitignore`      | Define what to ignore at commit time.      |
| `CHANGELOG.md`    | List of changes to the sample.             |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Guidelines for contributing to the sample. |
| `README.md`       | This README file.                          |
| `LICENSE`         | The license for the sample.                |

## Prerequisites

Outline the required components and tools that a user might need to have on their machine in order to run the sample. This can be anything from frameworks, SDKs, OS versions or IDE releases.

## Setup

Explain how to prepare the sample once the user clones or downloads the repository. The section should outline every step necessary to install dependencies and set up any settings (for example, API keys and output folders).

## Runnning the sample

Outline step-by-step instructions to execute the sample and see its output. Include steps for executing the sample from the IDE, starting specific services in the Azure portal or anything related to the overall launch of the code.

## Key concepts

Provide users with more context on the tools and services used in the sample. Explain some of the code that is being used and how services interact with each other.
