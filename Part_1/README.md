
In this exercise you will be asked to examine a number of vintage newsgroup posts and identify terms or phrases that you think will be useful for identifying other posts to that same newsgroup.

Go to the [rule authoring web app](https://marinchapp10.azurewebsites.net/) and add your rules to the database.

To see how the well the whole collection of rules works, go to the [rule performance webapp](https://ml4managers.shinyapps.io/evaluate_rules/).
